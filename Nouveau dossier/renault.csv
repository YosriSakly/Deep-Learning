0,"2 hours ago (Jun 23, 2019 02:21PM ET)",Hamilton dominates in France on a dull day for F1,nan,"By Alan BaldwinLE CASTELLET, France (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton put on a display of domination in a processional French Grand Prix on Sunday to go 36 points clear in the Formula One world championship and stretch Mercedes's winning run to 10 races.On a scorchingly hot afternoon at Le Castellet's Paul Ricard circuit, Hamilton put the rest of the field in the shade as he led from start to finish to take his fourth win in a row and sixth of the season.The Briton took the chequered flag 18 seconds ahead of Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, who was pushed hard at the end by Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in a short-lived moment of tension.While Mercedes celebrated their 50th one-two finish, fans around the world could be excused for stifling their yawns after a race that staked a solid claim for most boring of the year.""We are creating history together and I'm so proud to be part of this team,"" said Hamilton, who also won from pole last year at Le Castellet in a race where traffic gridlock on the roads outside proved more of a talking point.""It wasn't easy at all and everything is on the edge. I had quite big blisters on the front two tires - but this has been the best start of the year.""The five-times world champion now has 79 career wins, 12 short of Michael Schumacher's all-time record with 13 races remaining this season. He has 187 points to Bottas's 151. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, fifth on Sunday, is now 76 points behind Hamilton -- the equivalent to more than three race wins.Mercedes, heading for an unprecedented sixth straight constructors' and drivers' title double, have won all eight races this year as well as the last two of 2018 and look unstoppable.If they win in Austria next weekend, they will equal McLaren's achievement of 11 wins in a row in 1988 -- the longest sequence of success in the modern era.Statistics aside, the race was a forgettable one with the top four finishing in the order they started and an absence of controversy after a Canadian Grand Prix that stirred up plenty of heated debate.BROKEN BOLLARDUntil the closing laps, the main thrill was provided by a brave marshal who darted across the track to retrieve a broken bollard.Hamilton made a clean start, was 2.3 seconds clear of Bottas after six laps and continued to pull away despite complaining at one point that something had broken on his seat - a gripe undermined by the Briton lapping faster and faster.He was so far ahead by the time he pitted that he came out ahead of Vettel, who had yet to make his stop.Max Verstappen was fourth for Red Bull while Vettel, who had started seventh on the grid, pitted on the penultimate lap for fresh tires to snatch an extra point for fastest lap from Hamilton.""This weekend, the biggest aim was to close the gap as much as possible and we failed,"" said Vettel, who has not won for 16 races.""We have to understand why some of the bits we brought didn’t work and hopefully we can try again and the track layout in Austria next week will go our way.""Spaniard Carlos Sainz finished sixth for McLaren ahead of Daniel Ricciardo for  Renault  (PA:RENA).The Australian was later handed two five-second penalties for leaving the track, rejoining unsafely and gaining an advantage, dropping him to 11th and out of the points.Kimi Raikkonen moved up to seventh for Alfa Romeo with Renault's Nico Hulkenberg eighth and Lando Norris ninth for McLaren after losing three places on the last lap due to an hydraulics problem. The final point went to Red Bull's French driver Pierre Gasly. His compatriot Romain Grosjean, in a Haas, was the only retirement.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1,"Jun 22, 2019 03:05PM ET","Motor racing: Hamilton on pole in France, Vettel only seventh",nan,"By Alan BaldwinLE CASTELLET, France (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton seized pole position for the French Grand Prix in track record time on Saturday as Mercedes, chasing their 10th successive win, swept the front row of the grid in dominant fashion.The Formula One world championship leader and last year's race winner was 0.286 seconds quicker than team mate Valtteri Bottas on another searingly hot afternoon at Le Castellet in the south of France.The front row lockout was the 63rd for Mercedes, a Formula One record. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc qualified third with team mate Sebastian Vettel a distant seventh on a distinctly off day for the German.The pole, won in a time of one minute 28.319 seconds, was a record-extending 86th of Hamilton's career and his third of the season. The time was 1.7 seconds faster than the lap he did last year to take the top slot.""The first lap was fantastic, really, really happy with it,"" said the five-times world champion.""The second run, I was on for one of the best laps I have done for a long time. And it’s crazy; it never gets old, it never gets easier and it’s always such a challenge, regardless of what position you are battling for.""Hamilton lost time at the end, a gust of wind blowing the back of his Mercedes out of shape, but he was still comfortably quickest.The Briton is 29 points clear of Bottas after seven races, all won by the pair. Hamilton also triumphed in the last two of 2018.Bottas was fastest in the first two phases of qualifying, after also leading final practice, but could not match Hamilton's sizzling pace when it mattered in the final top-10 shoot-out.""The wind changed direction and there was a couple of corners my line didn't work and I had to work it out but Lewis had a better lap,"" said the Finn.Mercedes have looked to be in a class of their own all weekend at a circuit suiting the characteristics of their car, with Hamilton or Bottas fastest in every practice session.Leclerc, rather than Vettel, has consistently been the best of the rest.Vettel struggled, backing out of his first hot lap and then failing to string together all the sectors smoothly on his second attempt.""I don't know what happened, I lost so much momentum there was no point to finish that lap,"" said the German, who starts behind the Renault-powered McLarens of British rookie Lando Norris (fifth) and Spaniard Carlos Sainz (sixth).""Some laps it felt good and others it didn't. I didn't get the best out of the car but it was difficult for me, some laps I didn't have he grip I had before.""Vettel's time of 1:29.799 was eighth tenths of a second slower than Leclerc's best.McLaren's performance was their best in qualifying since 2016, when now-retired Jenson Button qualified third in Australia. Leclerc, who starts with Red Bull's Max Verstappen alongside, asked the team over the radio to get Vettel to speed up, worried he might run out of time for a final quick lap.Australian Daniel Ricciardo starts eighth for  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Red Bull's Pierre Gasly lines up ninth -- outqualified by Verstappen for the seventh time this year -- for his home race.Italian Antonio Giovinazzi starts 10th for Alfa Romeo.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

5,"Jun 20, 2019 04:26AM ET","Fed effect, Italy send European shares to 6-week highs",nan,"By Amy Caren Daniel and Medha Singh(Reuters) - Signs that Brussels will hold off on disciplinary action over Italy's budget helped European stocks hit six-week highs on Thursday, as the latest signals of potential new monetary stimulus from the world's big central banks boosted sentiment. Milan's main index rallied 0.74% and its banking index gained 0.36% after officials said the European Commission was unlikely to recommend further steps next week in disciplinary procedures over the country's rising debt. That was a small gesture in a process that investors worry may worsen Italy's already delicate economic and fiscal prospects, but was enough to outpace a roughly half percent rise in the pan-European STOXX 600 index.Traders said the dominant factor, however, was the Federal Reserve's signals late on Wednesday that a cut in interest rates as soon as July may be on the way, following up on a surprisingly strong speech from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi earlier this week that more action was possible.Euro zone and German bond yields tumbled in response, pointing to more respite for European public and private sector borrowers, although interest rate sensitive banking stocks underperformed.""Falling bonds yields are signaling that the monetary policy for the time being is going to be slightly more accommodative and may even be more accommodative going forward,"" said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg Bank in London.""As we've seen inflation surprising on the downside this year, the Fed and the ECB can support expansion by cutting rates or at least signaling that it could be happening and investors like it if the message is slightly more dovish than they expected."" JUNE RECOVERYExpectations of policy easing by the two central banks has helped drive a near 5% gain for the STOXX 600 this month, helping the main index recoup almost all of a steep sell-off that made May the worst month in more than two years.Signs that the United States and China will return to the negotiating table over trade also bolstered sentiment, with tariff-sensitive auto and technology stocks gaining 1.1% and 1.4% respectively.French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) rose 1.6% after its chief executive Thierry Bollore said cutting its stake in alliance partner Nissan was not on the agenda.London's FTSE 100 was a laggard as sterling gained against a broadly weaker dollar following the Fed's message, with a Bank of England policy statement at 1100 GMT expected to continue to point in the opposite direction on rates.Germany's DAX hit its highest level since May 3, helped by software company SAP advancing 1.5% after arch-rival Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) forecast current-quarter profit above estimates.German food delivery company Delivery Hero jumped 11.5%, the most among the benchmark index, after raising its full year revenue outlook by 200 million euros. One high-profile faller was  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), which slipped 0.5 after a report U.S. federal authorities are investigating whether the German lender complied with laws meant to stop money laundering and other crimes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

6,"Jun 20, 2019 02:15AM ET","Renault, Nissan join Waymo in exploring driverless services in France, Japan",nan,"By Paul Lienert and Laurence FrostDETROIT/PARIS (Reuters) - French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), its Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co and tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo are exploring a partnership to develop and use self-driving vehicles to transport people and goods in France and Japan, the companies said on Thursday.The proposed venture could also be expanded to other markets, the companies said.If the partnership is realized, it will have ramifications for other alliances and other self-driving projects, most of which have yet to hit the road. Automakers across the world are re-thinking independent autonomous vehicle efforts, and instead looking for partners to share rising investment costs and regulatory risks.In Japan, a potential competitor to a Renault-Nissan-Waymo venture would be Monet Technologies, a self-driving project involving Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co and backed by SoftBank Group Corp. SoftBank and Honda also have invested in General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Cruise self-driving car unit.The initial agreement among Waymo, Renault and Nissan aims to ""develop a framework for deployment of mobility services at scale,"" according to Hadi Zablit, Renault-Nissan Alliance business development chief. Physical testing of vehicles and deployment of services would come in later phases.The two automakers will set up 50-50 joint ventures in France and Japan to develop the driverless transportation services. Zablit said a later Waymo investment is ""one of the options"" under consideration.With Waymo, they will also research commercial, legal and regulatory issues related to building automated transportation-as-a-service businesses in the two countries.The agreement is time-limited and exclusive in both countries, barring either side from working with competitors. Its duration was not disclosed.It is not clear how involving Waymo might affect the existing alliance between Renault and Nissan, which has been strained since the departure earlier this year of longtime chief executive Carlos Ghosn, or a proposed merger between Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.FCA and Renault reached a preliminary agreement in late May to pursue a $35 billion merger. But FCA Chairman John Elkann abruptly withdrew the offer on June 6 after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked a board vote and demanded more time to win backing from Nissan.Waymo late last year began offering a self-driving service in Arizona called Waymo One, but with a human monitor on board.Waymo also has an existing partnership with FCA under which the automaker is supplying Chrysler Pacifica minivans for Waymo's fledgling self-driving fleet in the United States and eventually may buy self-driving systems from Waymo for its own vehicles.FCA also agreed in early June to partner with Aurora, the Silicon Valley startup co-founded by former Waymo chief Chris Urmson and funded in part by South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. The alliance took an earlier step towards working with Alphabet last year, when it agreed to adopt the Google Android operating system in its future vehicles.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) are looking for ways to resuscitate a failed merger plan and secure Nissan's approval, Reuters reported this month. As part of the fallout of the collapse of talks, Nissan is poised to urge Renault to significantly cut its 43.4% stake in the Japanese carmaker, two people told Reuters.""This is not at all our agenda,"" Bollore told reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday when asked if Renault would reduce its stake in Nissan to get a deal with FCA.""For us it is so important that we continuously improve our alliance. Not only for now, but also for the future and this is the mindset which we are in, and these are the discussions we have with our partners,"" Bollore said after the global launch of Renault's Triber multi-purpose vehicle.Bollore said the alliance partners planned to meet in early July and while he declined to disclose the agenda, he added that it would be ""massive"". The 20-year-old partnership between Nissan and Renault has been strained since the alliance's former chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested for suspected financial misconduct in November. Ghosn denies any wrongdoing.The alliance was plunged further into crisis this month as Renault's demand for a greater say in Nissan's governance drew rare public censure by the Japanese automaker. Nissan is due to hold a shareholder meeting to vote on its overhauled governance structure on June 25. Bollore said Renault would participate, but the talks were private.Renault and FCA were in $35 billion merger talks until the Italian-American carmaker withdrew after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked a vote by its board and demanded more time to win Nissan's backing.Bollore said there is no offer from FCA on the table and declined to comment on the role of the French government.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

12,"Jun 14, 2019 09:25AM ET","French, Italian shipbuilders forge naval alliance",nan,"By Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - France and Italy forged a military shipbuilding alliance on Friday, as state-controlled Naval Group and Fincantieri signed off on a 50-50 joint venture that will bid for Franco-Italian warship projects and sell to the world market.The alliance reflects the two countries' desire to fend off competition in naval shipbuilding from the likes of China, the United States and Russia. It is targeting orders worth up to 5 billion euros ($5.63 billion) over the next decade. Naval Group said the joint venture aims to build 10-15 warships in that period, with synergies estimated at 10-15%. ""It is the product of a shared industrial ambition,"" Herve Guillou, chief executive of Naval Group told reporters on a call. ""We are by far the two biggest naval shipbuilders in Europe, but we cannot remain competitive and maximize our resources if we rely only on our domestic markets.""The joint venture does not entail a share swap between the two groups.France and Italy first outlined plans to deepen naval shipbuilding cooperation in September 2017. However, political and business relations between the two euro zone powerhouses have become increasingly fraught since then and uncertainty hangs over other deals.Earlier this month, Fiat Chrysler withdrew its proposal for a 35 billion euro merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA), with both the Italian-American carmaker and Rome blaming French government interference for the deal's collapse. Meanwhile, at France's request, the European Union's antitrust chief is examining Fincantieri's purchase of a 50% stake in French shipbuilder Chantiers de l'Atlantique, formerly STX, a move which irritated Fincantieri and Rome.Fincantieri top executives recently said they were confident of winning approval from Brussels, but that it could take some months. The joint venture between Fincantieri and Naval Group, in which French defense company Thales has a 35% stake, seeks to balance power within the alliance.That has been a stumbling block for other Franco-Italian mergers such as the troubled Essilor-Luxottica tie-up.The new enterprise will be headquartered in Genoa, with its engineering center based in France's southern Var region. Its chief executive Claude Centofanti is a Frenchman and its chairman, Giuseppe Bono, an Italian who is also CEO of Fincantieri.The two companies have said they will look for efficiencies by taking advantage of their bigger scale, jointly conducting some research and sharing test facilities. Guillou said the market for mid-size to large frigates was growing 5-7% a year. ""It's also where the emerging competition is attacking us the hardest,"" he added. He said there was potential for Naval Group and the new JV to derive synergies too from the Fincantieri-Chantiers de l'Atlantique tie-up, but a go-ahead from Brussels would be needed before they can be more deeply explored.But he added that the setting up of the venture and the merger between Fincantieri and Chantier were separate issues, downplaying analysts' hopes the JV could make it easier to win the go-ahead for Fincantieri-Chantier.Naval Group holds a minority stake in Chantiers de l'Atlantique. ""We could imagine buying steel benefitting from scale of volume,"" Guillou said. ""When you think about what vessels of the future might look like, and cleaner energies, it's not something that will only interest military shipbuilders.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Jun 13, 2019 07:10AM ET","As Iran nuclear deal flounders, France turns to Saudi for oil",nan,"By John Irish and Bate FelixPARIS (Reuters) - Over the past year, France has led a European push to keep trade with Iran alive after the United States tore up the nuclear deal with Tehran and re-imposed sanctions. But over the same period, data shows France has cut purchases of Iranian oil and sharply increased imports from Iran's arch-enemy Saudi Arabia.In recent weeks, France has used its energy needs to justify a surge in arms sales to the kingdom, even if there is no evidence the 50 percent increase in Saudi purchases of French arms last year was conditional on France buying Saudi oil. The surge in France's buying of Saudi oil shows Paris is doing less business with Iran even as it publicly encourages European partners to find a way to keep trade with Tehran flowing via the Franco-German-British Instex trade system.It also underscores how difficult it is for a global power and permanent U.N. Security Council member like France to stand up against the United States and its closest Arab-world ally when they are determined to put the squeeze on Iran.Last month, Defence Minister Florence Parly said trade ties with allies like Saudi Arabia were essential to safeguarding France's security and energy interests.""(Weapons) exports make it possible to forge close ties with states that are strategic for the security of France,"" she told parliament, one of the first times a senior official has linked arms sales to France's broader economic relations with Saudi Arabia. ""It puts us at the heart of the Middle East, a key region for our security interests and our energy supplies."" Asked about the link between oil purchases and arms sales, a French diplomatic source was straightforward: ""We want to save the nuclear deal because it helps peace in the region, but we have always had a historical relationship with Saudi Arabia so why would we jeopardize this?""The sharp drop-off in Iran's ability to sell its oil internationally has hit the economy hard, delivering exactly the impact the Instex system is designed to prevent in the long-term. French finance ministry data shows France bought 2.2 billion euros ($2.49 billion) of Iranian light crude between April 2017 and March 2018, making it France's third largest supplier.But over the following 12-months, that figure fell 57% to 936 million euros, with imports from Iran stopping altogether from September 2018 onwards, as sanctions bit.In contrast, French purchases of Saudi oil jumped 50% to 3.7 billion euros between March 2018 and April 2019.Industry sources say Saudi and Iranian crude oil have very similar properties that make them good substitutes. Over the same period, Paris also substantially increased its purchases of Russian and Iraqi crude, which are also similar.All countries had to reduce oil imports from Iran as sanctions mounted, although China and India continued to buy after initial U.S. waivers, although they have now also cut purchases.CLOSER SAUDI TIESFrance has nurtured close ties with Saudi Arabia. But the nuclear deal in 2015 between Iran and six world powers - the United States, France, Britain, China, Germany and Russia - eased sanctions in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program, providing an economic lifeline for Riyadh's rival.France, with business ties in Iran, moved quickly to capitalize, and some of its biggest corporations followed. Total was the first international oil company to return to Iran, while other French firms such as carmakers PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA) also moved back.Between 2016 and early 2018, French purchases of Iranian crude oil soared to more than 2 billion euros a year.However, U.S. President Donald Trump, who arrived in the White House as Iran's economy was reaping the benefits of the deal, called it ""the worst ever negotiated"". He pulled the United States out, re-imposed tough sanctions, including on Iran's oil sector, and threatened punishment for allies like France who kept doing business with Tehran.The U.S. decision was always likely to tighten French ties with Saudi Arabia, said Jalel Harchaoui, fellow at Clingendael Institute in The Hague. ""The U.S. unilaterally walking away from the JCPOA (nuclear deal) forced France to reduce its economic transactions with Iran. That development is seen as yet another reason to tighten the closeness between Paris and the Gulf capitals,"" he said.Saudi Arabia backs the United States' tough line on Iran and has sought to broaden the anti-Iran front. France shares concerns over Iran's ballistic missile program and meddling in the Middle East, but says engagement is preferable to isolation. FROM WEAPONS TO ENERGY SECURITYThe shift to buying more Saudi oil comes at a sensitive time for France and its relations with the kingdom. In particular, President Emmanuel Macron is under fire from political rivals and human rights organizations over French weapons sales to Saudi and the United Arab Emirates. Both states have used the weapons in the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has urged Riyadh to end the ""dirty war"" in Yemen, but also accused Iran of supplying the Houthis with weapons they have used against Saudi territory. He and Macron have defended arms sales to Saudi and the UAE as necessary in the global fight against terrorism.Saudi Arabia has been France's top arms buyer over the last five years, with sales jumping 50 percent to about 1 billion euros in 2018.Rather than avoiding the issue, Macron's government has sought to draw a link between energy and security in answering criticism over the weapons sales. ""Maintaining economic relations with these countries means keeping a presence in key regions for our security interests and our energy supplies,"" Parly said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

News of the rebuff came as Renault shareholders voted on Wednesday to endorse Senard's January appointment to replace Carlos Ghosn, the ousted leader of the Renault-Nissan alliance. Senard, whose bid to merge with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) over Nissan's reservations was thwarted by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Macron to appeal for his support, four government and company sources said.Seven months after Ghosn's arrest on financial misconduct charges - which he denies - the alliance he forged is on life support. Nissan refused to study a full Renault tie-up proposed by Senard, and wants to weaken its 43.4% shareholder's grip.Instead, Senard then tabled an FCA-Renault deal proposal developed without Nissan's knowledge. But FCA Chairman John Elkann withdrew the offer after France, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked the June 5 board vote and demanded more time to secure Nissan's endorsement.Days later, in a third risky move that caused outrage in Japan, Senard vowed to block governance reforms introduced by Nissan after the Ghosn scandal unless Renault gets more seats on the Japanese firm's powerful new board committees.Renault sources say Senard's exasperation deepened when Le Maire, seeking to smooth tensions from the sidelines of a weekend G20 meeting in Japan, publicly discussed a possible cut to France's 15% Renault stake or even Renault's Nissan holding.Senard felt further undermined by Le Maire's surprise pronouncements and told colleagues he expected to be ""backed up from the highest level of government"", according to one. But Macron's office declined a proposed sit-down, the sources said. ""There is no meeting with Senard on the president's agenda,"" an Elysee official said on Wednesday.Renault declined to comment. But sources close to the chairman played down the rebuffed meeting request and said he was determined to stay put.ON TOP FORMSenard and Macron ""communicate regularly by text message"", one said, and the French head of state is extremely busy with other matters. ""Senard is on top form for his shareholders' meeting and is resolved to continue.""France is not seeking to replace Senard, another government source said. ""He may have taken some bad advice, and he should clearly have made more personnel changes for Renault to move on"" from the Ghosn era, he added.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa and Renault CEO Thierry Bollore, Ghosn's former second-in-command who was promoted in January, barely speak and are now seen as clear irritants to the relationship, French official and company sources say.""Senard has become well aware of this,"" said a person familiar with his thinking. ""So we'll see how things evolve after the shareholder meeting.""Saikawa's position also appears more fragile, after two leading investment advisory firms recommended a vote against his reappointment at the Japanese carmaker's June 25 shareholder gathering.The recommendations may boost the chances of Saikawa's exit, although a vote against him remains unlikely. Under a 2015 amendment to alliance shareholder pacts, Renault is required to support the Nissan board's proposal to renew his mandate.Senard told Renault shareholders on Wednesday that he remained ""distressed"" that a board vote on the FCA merger had been prevented. ""I don't know what the future holds, but the proposal remains an exceptional one to my mind,"" he said.Senard and Elkann have discussed ways to revive the deal with Nissan's support, Reuters reported this week.Hewing more closely to the government's line, however, Senard added that his priority was to strengthen the alliance.

Tech firms and carmakers have outlined their positions in two diverging sets of guidelines relating to the way licensing fees are calculated and the terms for using patented technology.Both sets of guidelines have support from the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC).Although any guidelines are voluntary, the lack of broad agreement can mean disputes quickly escalate.IP Europe, a lobby group which includes Nokia and other European telecoms firms such as Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Orange, said its new guidelines would support small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) as they develop technology.""I believe these principles and guidance will help SMEs better understand the cellular licensing process, making it easier for them to participate in cellular standards development and licensing,"" IP Europe SME Chair Ruben Bonet said.Rival guidelines have been put forward with the backing of 56 organizations that include Daimler, BMW,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Honda.They have proposed a code that sets out six principles for assessing whether licensing fees for essential patents are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.""Companies can look at both guidelines and make their decisions,"" said Michael Sax, chairman of The App Association.Carmaker Daimler, automotive supplier Continental and auto parts firm  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) have all complained to the European Union antitrust regulators in the past about Nokia's codes covering use of the telecom equipment maker's patents that are vital for developing ""smart"" cars and self-driving vehicles.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

20,"Jun 12, 2019 01:26AM ET",Proxy advisers lob rare rebuke against Nissan CEO Saikawa,nan,"By Linda Sieg and Naomi Tajitsu(Reuters) - Two leading proxy advisory firms have urged Nissan shareholders to vote against reappointing its chief executive as a director, heaping more pressure on Hiroto Saikawa as he struggles to find accord with alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA).The move marks a rare public rebuke by international proxy firms against the leader of a top-tier Japanese firm, and comes just as the scandal-hit automaker struggles to move on from the legacy of Carlos Ghosn, its ousted chairman who stands accused of financial misconduct.It also underscores the precarious position of Saikawa, who was groomed for leadership by Ghosn but appears unable to mend a relationship with Renault that one source said appeared to be in jeopardy.Institutional Shareholder Services recommended shareholders vote against Saikawa as director at Nissan's annual general meeting this month, to ensure a ""clean break"" from the Carlos Ghosn era. Ghosn, first arrested in November, is awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges. He denies all the charges against him.""When the company needs to break from the past and build a strong board with fresh members, the reelection of Hiroto Saikawa, who has been on the board for 14 years and worked closely with Carlos Ghosn, does not appear appropriate,"" Institutional Shareholder Services said in a research note.The firm also advised shareholders to vote against the nomination of Moto Nagai to Nissan's board, saying the former executive of Mizuho Financial Group served as an independent auditor at Nissan during Ghosn's tenure, and ""shares responsibility"" for failing to exercise oversight of Ghosn's alleged wrongdoing.Another proxy adviser, Glass Lewis, similarly told shareholders not to vote for Saikawa, who needs the support of at least half of voting shareholders at the June 25 meeting to be reappointed. ""We cannot confidently support the nomination of Mr. Saikawa who - as the representative director and president of the Company - should have taken greater steps in performing its oversight responsibilities in the misconduct of the board members,"" it said in a report to clients.Nissan declined to comment on the recommendations, which were both published on Friday.ALLIANCE CRISISA recent push by Renault to block a governance overhaul at Nissan has put the Franco-Japanese automaking alliance in jeopardy, a person familiar with Nissan's thinking told Reuters.The two-decade-old partnership was plunged into fresh crisis this week after Renault signaled it would block its partner from adopting planned governance reforms unless the French automaker received more say in the new system. Nissan has publicly called that demand ""most regrettable"".""I have to say that they are endangering the alliance. They have to be very careful not to antagonize Japanese people, shareholders,"" the person said, referring to Renault.""Renault has been saying the alliance is important and irreversible but what they are trying to do is to break the alliance,"" the person said, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.By abstaining from the governance vote, Renault would effectively block the new governance system - which includes three committees - as adoption requires two-thirds approval.The rift lays bare the deep strain between the two automakers, whose alliance has been under pressure since Ghosn's arrest. What's at stake now may be even bigger than their vast alliance, which includes Mitsubishi Motors.Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are looking for ways to resuscitate a collapsed merger plan and secure Nissan's approval for that deal, Reuters reported this week. Nissan is, therefore, poised to urge Renault to significantly cut its 43.4% stake in Nissan, Reuters has reported. Nissan recently said it would abstain from voting on the FCA-Renault merger, although both FCA and Renault later blamed the failure of that deal squarely on the French government.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We will now inscribe this target into law,"" Borne said.The mobility law will also facilitate the rollout of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, notably by giving the residents of apartment buildings the right to ask for the installation of EV plugs in their parking lots.The much-delayed law, which is currently being debated in parliament, is expected to be approved after the summer and will update a 1982 law on transportation.The reform wants to favor alternatives to individual automobile usage, upgrade railway networks and create a legal framework for new mobility solutions such as free-floating bicycles, electric scooters and car-sharing.It will also give companies the option to offer employees a tax-free 400 euro subsidy to come to work on bicycles or with car-sharing. Borne said companies would be obliged to discuss this subsidy in wage negotiations with unions, but the subsidy would not be mandatory for all companies."
23,"Jun 11, 2019 05:30AM ET","StockBeat: Time for Fiat-Renault-Nissan, Round 2",nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s time for round two of the three-way boxing match that is Fiat-Renault-Nissan.As we noted two weeks ago, the underlying pressure for consolidation isn’t going away, so it’s best to view the sudden announcement of  Fiat  Chrysler's(MI:FCHA) original merger bid, and its equally sudden withdrawal, as just the opening salvoes in what is likely to be a drawn-out negotiating process, an attempt at jockeying for position by all three parties.The first round served to illustrate that  Renault  (PA:RENA) is highly vulnerable to opportunist bids unless it repairs its damaged alliance with Nissan (T:7201). Renault’s market capitalization is currently 16 billion euros, but its 43% stake in Nissan is worth 10.5 billion and it has over six billion in cash, so that gives you an idea of what the market thinks its car business is worth.Round one also proved that even if they don’t want to pursue a full merger, the French and Japanese can still both block each other’s plans, which is no-one's interest. Renault retaliated to Nissan’s abstention on the merger deal by abstaining a key vote on essential governance reforms at Nissan. And, as noted previously, it proved that the French state cannot hope to run a company spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia.As those lessons are absorbed, positions are shifting, although whether they will move enough to end the current impasse is still far from clear. Nissan’s CEO Hiroto Saikawa told the Financial Times that Nissan “must make its peace” with the French company, while French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told AFP that he’s ready to cut the government stake in Renault if that’s what’s needed to solidify the alliance with Nissan. Interestingly, he said nothing about what it might take to revive the interest of Fiat.As for Fiat, Italian newspapers are reporting this morning that it may now look at Hyundai in its quest to bulk up. The move would add a little scale and some distribution synergies, but little else – especially since Hyundai, like Fiat, is a late arrival the electric vehicle party. Renault-Nissan would remain the more attractive partner, but it risks becoming the junior partner in any deal if the Franco-Japanese alliance cements itself first.What’s set to be a long-running drama is unfolding against a more positive backdrop on Tuesday morning, as European markets follow Asia higher on reports that Beijing has instructed local municipalities to open the spending taps again. That’s a form of economic support that’s less likely to antagonize the U.S. than letting the yuan slip, as was feared before the weekend. The Chinese currency has been stable so far this week.By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 3.1 points or 0.8% at 381.40. The U.K. FTSE was lagging, up only 0.5%, after a mixed labor market report added to fears for the economy after a sharp drop in monthly GDP in April. Germany’s Dax was up 1.3% at a four-week high, catching up on Monday’s rally after a public holiday. France’s CAC 40 was up 0.7%."

26,"Jun 10, 2019 11:10PM ET",Maybe Carlos Ghosn Wasn't So Bad After All,nan,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is the Renault-Nissan Alliance stronger than the man who led it for two decades?The omens don’t look good. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn over allegations of financial misconduct has opened up a Pandora’s Box of Franco-Japanese political hostility, grudges and pressure tactics – supposedly all in the name of “strengthening” the 20-year alliance. For all Ghosn’s flaws and delusions of grandeur, he did manage to balance the interests of two prickly G7 economies in the highly sensitive auto sector (at least until he came a cropper). His successors will do well to last a fraction as long.On the French side,  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s chairman Jean-Dominique Senard was parachuted in to rescue relations with Nissan Motor Corp Ltd. after Ghosn’s arrest. But he’s failing to live up to his billing as a veteran captain of industry and diplomat’s son. First he tried to rush his Japanese counterparts into accepting a full Renault-Nissan merger. Then he tried and failed to get Nissan’s blessing for a tie-up with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, an embarrassment for the French president Emmanuel Macron. Not a great start.Having failed to win the Japanese around with blandishments, an increasingly desperate-looking Senard has reached for the stick. He’s now threatening to use Renault’s 43% stake in Nissan to block the latter’s attempt to shake up its corporate governance. This looks like more of a tactical play than any genuine desire to stall much-needed reforms at the Japanese carmaker, which is only now waking up to the need for separate remuneration, audit and nomination committees. But that won’t make it any more palatable to Tokyo.Optically, it looks a lot like a Renault attempt to get more control over the new committees. Even if it works in forcing Nissan to the negotiating table to sort out other issues, it’s a mightily clumsy about-turn for a chairman who said in April that the Japanese would not respond well to “humiliation” tactics.Still, Ghosn’s replacement at Nissan, CEO Hiroto Saikawa, is hardly covering himself in glory. Like Senard, he seems incapable of wielding power without looking weak. Nissan owns just 15% of Renault, so it’s at a disadvantage in terms of shareholdings. But if Saikawa was trying to take back control with his ousting of Ghosn and the governance changes, the limits have been laid bare this week.Nissan will have an incredibly tough time pushing these reforms through without Renault’s support, a painful reminder of Saikawa’s constraints. The Japanese carmaker’s poor financial performance isn’t helping. Former Nissan executive Greg Kelly is also ratcheting up the pressure by accusing Saikawa of approving Ghosn’s pay structure.Only now do we realize Ghosn’s skill – and maybe his good fortune – when it came to balancing the needs of two countries with a history of national pride and state interference in industry. Renault has a very big stake in Nissan, yes, but not majority control. In retrospect it’s remarkable that Ghosn was able to push a sickly Nissan into adopting truly revolutionary changes after the creation of the alliance: An end to cozy deals with historical suppliers, massive job cuts, and the ceding of control to non-Japanese executives.To be fair to Senard and Saikawa, Ghosn’s personal empire-building and his ability to hoover up all the top jobs probably helped – at one point he was running Renault and Nissan simultaneously, as well as their alliance. Arguably too much power was concentrated in the hands of one man. But he’s clearly left a void, which has been filled by squabbling. In response to Parisian meddling, Nissan has woken up to its own ability to pressure the French even with a smaller stake. These power games are very risky for both firms given the economic benefits offered by the alliance, something that’s doubly important now that the auto industry is facing the epochal challenge of the death of the combustion engine and the possible decline of car ownership.Bankers are still confident that the partnership will survive. But the distrust that is setting in, as well as the lack of leadership, portends a long-term weakening."
27,"Jun 10, 2019 02:20PM ET",Ricciardo boosted by strong weekend in Canada,nan,"(Reuters) - Daniel Ricciardo hopes to put on a show at Renault's home French Grand Prix this month after the team doubled their season's points tally in Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix.The Australian finished sixth in Montreal, the seventh race of the year, with German team mate Nico Hulkenberg a close seventh.""The weekend as a whole pretty awesome. Qualified fourth, finished sixth,"" Ricciardo told Sky Sports television. ""I'm sure if you'd said to (team boss) Cyril (Abiteboul) before the weekend 'how does this result sound?' he would have probably kissed you. I think we've got to be really happy with that."" Renault  (PA:RENA) were eighth overall in the championship before the seventh round of the season but moved up to fifth, on 28 points and just two behind McLaren who use the same engines.Sunday was the team's first double points finish of the campaign.The next race up is Le Castellet on June 23, with Renault hoping to show clear progress by then after a difficult start to the season.Abiteboul told reporters in Monaco last month that Renault had fixed a fundamental engine problem that had slowed both Ricciardo and Hulkenberg and they were now back to full power.""We've certainly got some momentum now and the last few weekends have been stronger,"" said Ricciardo, who joined from Red Bull at the end of last season. ""We've got a few new parts coming.""The Australian said he had also been buoyed by keeping Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas, second in the championship to team mate Lewis Hamilton, behind for a number of laps and making him fight to get past.""I think the encouraging thing was for sure a few elbows out with Bottas,"" he said. ""Our straight line speed is certainly much more competitive in race conditions. A lot of positives to take. ""We'll see how we go in France. (Hopefully) for the Renault home fans we can pull off another good one.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

29,"Jun 10, 2019 09:39AM ET",Stocks - Dow Jumps Triple Digits as Trump Touts Tariff Success; M&A Supports,nan,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks headed higher Monday as U.S. President Donald Trump suspended plans to implement tariffs on Mexico and showed confidence that similar tactics with China would also prove successful, while a wave of mergers and acquisitions also boosted bullish sentimentThe Dow Jones gained 164 points, or 0.6%, to 26,170.5 points by 9:35 AM ET (13:35 GMT), while the S&P 500 rose 19 points, or 0.7%, 2,794.30 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 83 points, or 1.1%, at 7,502.38 points.Trump cancelled the planned implementation of 5% tariffs on all Mexican goods that was due to go in effect Monday as he claimed that “there is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico and the USA”.The fact the president was willing to remove tariffs caused some speculation that a similar deal could be made with China.“The assumption here is that this move demonstrates the pragmatic nature of U.S. trade policy and raises expectations that Presidents Trump and Xi could find some room for accommodation when they meet at the G20 summit on June 28-29,” Chris Turner, global head of strategy at ING, said, warning that markets would likely still need to see “clear signs of improvement”.Trump made clear on Monday that he could return to tariff threats if the Mexican Congress did not approve the deal reached last week.The president also insisted that the deal on immigration with Mexico was made precisely because he had threatened tariffs, although other published reports over the weekend said that there was little new in the deal and that Mexico and the U.S. had agreed to many of the terms months ago.“If we didn’t have tariffs, we wouldn’t have a deal with Mexico,” Trump said in a phone interview with CNBC.Trump also claimed that the tariff tactic would ultimately work with China. Beijing is “going to make a deal because they’re going to have to make a deal,” he said, claiming that “China is getting absolutely decimated” by companies leaving the world’s second-largest economy in order to avoid tariffs.Risk assets have been roiled by fears that escalating trade tensions could potentially lead to a global recession. G20 finance leaders who met over the weekend warned that intensifying trade and geopolitical tensions were still the biggest risk to the stabilization of global growth.But increasing bets that the Federal Reserve will be required to step in as promised to support the U.S. economic expansion have led to a renewed bout of risk appetite. Worse-than-expected job creation and easing wage inflation boosted those expectations last Friday, leading to Wall Street’s best weekly performance since the end of last year.On a thinly-filled economic calendar, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) for April will be released at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), providing further information on the state of the American labor market.Overnight, Chinese data showed some mixed readings as exports unexpectedly returned to growth. Some analysts suggested, however, that manufacturers may have increased shipments to avoid the most recent round of U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods. In a clearly negative sign, Chinese imports registered their largest decline in nearly three years, providing another indication of weak domestic demand.In company news, a wave of M&A activity buoyed bullish sentiment in stocks.United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) agreed to a merger that would create an aerospace and defense giant worth around $121 billion, the sector’s largest-deal ever. Tableau Software  (NYSE:DATA) agreed to be acquired by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in a deal valued at $15.7 billion.In the auto sector, buoyed by news of the tariff cancellation, Reuters reported that Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) had renewed discussions over a possible merger as they searched for ways to secure the approval of Nissan (T:7201) for the deal. That may include a reduction of the French carmaker’s stake in the Japanese company, according to sources cited.Reuters also reported that Apollo Global Management was leading in offers to acquire  Shutterfly  (NASDAQ:SFLY) in a deal that would value the digital imaging company at about $2 billion.Lastly, Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced that it would buy biopharma Tilos Therapeutics for about $773 million.Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, advanced 0.3% at 96.74 by 9:36 AM ET (13:36 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 2.13%.In commodities, gold futures fell $12.65, or 0.9%, to $1,333.45 a troy ounce, while crude oil gained 6 cents, or 0.1% at $54.05 a barrel."

It is testing and working on more than 10 projects with Israeli start-ups, including cybersecurity provider Argus, solar energy company Apollo Power and electrical propulsion system maker IRP Systems.Renault-Nissan alliance officials in Israel downplayed reports of strained relations between the two carmakers since the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in November.""Today is a very good example of what we are doing together,"" Gaspar Gascon Abellan, the alliance's deputy executive vice president of engineering, told reporters.""Speculation will run of course in the future, but at the team levels what we see is that we are collaborating very tightly and closely to develop all the new technologies."" The lab will enable the start-ups to test their technologies in vehicles. Financial details were not disclosed.The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance has similar labs in Silicon Valley and in Shanghai.""Through collaborations with promising local start-ups with cutting-edge technologies, we aim to develop a variety of key technologies that will be essential for the future of mobility,"" said Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, alliance executive vice president of engineering.The new facility will also cooperate with the alliance's venture capital fund, which plans global investment up to $1 billion over five years. It has invested in the Maniv Mobility fund in Israel though not in any local companies.Christian Noske, direct investments director of Alliance Ventures, said the fund typically invests $10 million per start-up and plans to invest in at least one Israeli business this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

31,"Jun 10, 2019 08:41AM ET","Renault rift with Nissan widens over governance, casts shadow on alliance",nan,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Laurence FrostTOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - The two-decade-old partnership of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Nissan Motor Co was plunged into fresh crisis on Monday, as the French automaker's demand for a greater say in Nissan's new governance system drew rare public censure by the Japanese firm.Renault, which owns 43.4% of the Japanese firm, signaled it would block Nissan from formally adopting an overhauled governance structure at a June 25 shareholder meeting - unless Renault received representation on new Nissan committees. The demand, conveyed in a letter from Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard just weeks before the meeting, could scuttle the new structure, created after months of deliberation by an outside committee and previously supported by Senard. Nissan responded in some of its frankest language yet against its top shareholder, calling the demand ""most regrettable"".""Nissan has received a letter from Renault indicating intention to abstain from voting,"" Nissan said in a statement.""Nissan finds Renault's new stance on this matter most regrettable, as such a stance runs counter to the company’s efforts to improve its corporate governance.""The rift lays bare the deep strain between the two automakers, whose alliance has been under pressure since the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in November. What's at stake now may be even bigger than their vast alliance, which includes Mitsubishi Motors.Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are looking for ways to resuscitate their collapsed merger plan and secure Nissan's approval for that deal, Reuters reported on Monday. Nissan is, therefore, poised to urge Renault to significantly cut the 43.4% stake, two people told Reuters.By abstaining from the governance vote, Renault would effectively block the new governance system - which includes three committees - as adoption requires two-thirds approval. Nissan recently said it would abstain from voting on the FCA-Renault merger, although both FCA and Renault later blamed the failure of that deal squarely on the French government. ""Renault's rights as 43.4% shareholder of Nissan need to be fully recognized and, at a minimum, one or two directors proposed by Renault should be members of each of the three committees,"" Renault said in its letter, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters.""As currently proposed, this does not seem to be the case.""CONFLICT OF INTEREST?A Renault source said Senard's letter was motivated by concern about Renault's under-representation on the new Nissan board committees being introduced following the arrest of Ghosn, who is now awaiting trial and denies the financial misconduct charges against him.""It's not a final abstention, and Renault's position can still change,"" the source said. ""As things stand, Renault has not been assured of appropriate committee representation as Nissan's main shareholder.""Renault had yet to receive specific details on the proposed composition of each of the committees, another source with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.A Nissan source said Renault CEO Thierry Bollore had expressed a desire to sit on new Nissan committees to oversee executive nominations and compensation, and a planned corporate governance auditing committee.But such a move would raise concerns about a possible conflict of interest, as it would give Renault a say in Nissan salaries and corporate governance, the Nissan source said.""It's shocking behavior from a shareholder that has been saying for months that it supports us in strengthening our corporate governance,"" the Nissan source said.The source added that even if Renault blocked the committees, Nissan would still try and go ahead and set up similar governance structures, and try to make them as binding as possible.DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, in Tokyo after a G20 meeting at the weekend, told reporters it was up to the management of both companies to solve their problems. The French government owns 15 percent in Renault.The rift could put further pressure on Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, who looks increasingly at odds with Renault.Japan's Jiji news agency earlier quoted Saikawa as saying: ""We are preparing for the shareholder meeting and will discuss necessary issues at the appropriate time. If there are differences of opinion (with Renault), then I'd like for those to be discussed"".In March a Nissan-appointed outside team recommended the formation of the three committees to improve its corporate governance. Under the proposal, Renault directors would be free to serve on the nominations committee, but would be barred from the compensation and audit committees. The two companies have struggled to repair their relationship after Ghosn's arrest exposed simmering tensions, including Nissan's long-held concerns about the alliance's capital structure.Nissan also appears to have been largely left in the dark on the merger discussions between Renault and Fiat Chrysler, which had attempted to join forces to create the world's third-largest automaker before talks fell apart last week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

32,"Jun 10, 2019 08:10AM ET","Stocks climb on trade, rate cut optimism; yuan falters",nan,"By Tom ArnoldLONDON (Reuters) - European shares followed Asian stocks higher on Monday after the United States shelved plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and as investors anticipated lower U.S. interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets next week on the back of poor jobs data.Investors had fretted that opening up another trade conflict, while still battling with China, could push the United States and other major economies into recession. The Mexican peso rallied as much as more than 2% on Monday.But in China, the yuan slipped to its weakest this year after the country's imports fell the most in nearly three years and as talks to end the Sino-U.S. dispute remained deadlocked.The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 0.1% in early trade, with Britain's FTSE 100 up 0.5%, while S&P500 mini futures were up 0.4% after rising as much as 0.8%.Liquidity was lower than usual with markets in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland shut for national holidays.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield was at 2.1431 percent, after hitting a 21-month low of 2.053 percent on Friday on soft U.S. jobs data.In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei closed up 1.2%, while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 1%.""Markets are blowing small celebratory bubbles,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.""There will be relief that the [Mexican] tariffs have been avoided and perhaps some might believe it shows Trump's propensity to strike deals after brinkmanship. As such there may be those thinking that a similar thing might happen with the China trade situation.""CARS MOVE AHEADThe European auto sector was boosted by signs that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) were looking for ways to revive their collapsed merger plan and secure the approval of Nissan Motor Co. Fiat Chrysler was up 1.9%, while Renault's shares were up 2.5%.In London, Thomas Cook's shares rose as much 20% after a report that Hong Kong-listed Fosun Tourism was in talks to buy its tour operating business as the British group faces breakup after issuing three profit warnings in the past year.Investors were also digesting Chinese data showing imports in May contracted 8.5% from a year earlier, a much worse than expected outcome that signaled weak domestic consumption.Exports, however, unexpectedly rose 1.1% last month, though many suspect the uptick is linked to front-loading of shipments by firms to avoid higher U.S. tariffs. ""Mexico is not China and investors will want to see some clear signs of improvement in U.S.-China relations before increasing exposure to risk assets. Before then the market is left focusing on poor Chinese import figures for May.....as speculation builds over whether the PBOC [the People's Bank of China] allows yuan to trade through 7 per dollar,"" said Chris Turner head of FX strategy at ING Bank.With the Mexico spat seemingly resolved, investors will now focus on whether U.S. President Donald Trump can reach a similar deal with China.""With Trump looking to win votes to secure a second term, an agreement with China will go some way to smoothing the path and he'll be focusing on that,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum. ""There'll be a lot of fudging and saber-rattling but when that happens there'll be an aggressive spike-up in stocks.""EYES ON THE FEDIn the United States, expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates kept the dollar on the defensive after a weak jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 75,000 jobs last month, much smaller than the 185,000 additions estimated by economists in a Reuters poll.Fed funds rate futures prices, down on Monday after the Mexico deal, were still pricing in more than two 25-basis point rate cuts by the end of this year, with one almost fully priced in by July.The Federal Reserve's next policy meeting is set for next week, on June 18-19.The euro pulled back from 2-1/2 month highs as the dollar strengthened and after sources said European Central Bank policymakers were open to cutting the ECB's policy rate should economic growth worsen.The euro fell 0.2% to $1.1306 after hitting $1.1348 last week, its highest since March.Euro zone government bond yields remained close to all-time lows. Core bond yields in the bloc were still at all-time lows, despite the two basis point move higher in the German bund in early trade to -0.24%, as expectations of easier monetary policy fuel bond buying.The euro was down almost 0.3% against the dollar at $1.1301 EUR= near a 2-1/2-month high of $1.1347 touched on Friday.China's yuan touched its lowest since late November after weak import data reignited worries about slowing domestic demand. The offshore rate was slightly lower at 6.9532 yuan per dollar but held above Friday's 2019 low.Gold slipped almost 1%, having hit a 14-month high of $1,348.1 per ounce on Friday, near a major resistance around $1,350.Many investors are still clinging to hopes that Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders' meeting late this month to seek a compromise on trade and other economic issues.Oil prices rose on Monday after Saudi Arabia said producer club OPEC and Russia should restrict supplies to current levels, with front-month Brent crude futures at $63.39, 0.2%, above Friday's close.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I don't know of any other time that an exception was made to do that.""Kelly's lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, was unavailable for comment. Reuters was unable to contact Kelly directly. Nissan spokesman Nick Maxfield said, ""We have no comment on the details of Kelly's interview at this time.""Kelly's comments may raise questions about Saikawa's push for improved corporate governance as he prepares to face shareholders at an annual meeting this month, amid a plunge in profit that has underscored his struggle to lead Nissan following the arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.Kelly has been charged with helping Ghosn hide around 9 billion yen in compensation. Both men deny wrongdoing.Ghosn also faces charges that he enriched himself at the expense of Nissan, and Saikawa has said the Japanese automaker may claim damages from his former mentor.Kelly in the interview did not say how he was aware of the exception or who authorized it. He did not claim any illegality on the part of Saikawa or Nissan, nor discuss the possible prevalence of such practices in corporate Japan.Since taking the lead at Nissan, Saikawa has worked to improve governance while navigating fraught relations with French majority shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Ghosn, as chairman of both automakers, had favored a merger before his ouster, while Saikawa had opposed, sources have told Reuters.On Monday, Renault signaled it would block Nissan's planned governance reforms unless it gets more say in them, a demand which Nissan called ""most regrettable"" and which one source derided as a potential conflict of interest.In his interview, Bungei Shunju quoted Kelly as saying Saikawa helped create an agreement to pay Ghosn millions of dollars in income after he retired to retain him as an advisor and keep him from working at one of Nissan's competitors.Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan have been charged for understating Ghosn's salary in agreeing to post-employment payments.""We didn't violate the law, we were trying to protect Nissan in a way that was lawful, which was to retain a talented top executive,"" Bungei Shunju quoted Kelly as saying. ""Saikawa signed the document, he was the only one.

37,"Jun 10, 2019 03:20AM ET",Europe Banks Are ‘Hostage’ to ECB’s Dovish Stance,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- With Europe’s economic growth showing more cracks and inflation not moving in the desired direction, the ECB once again opened the door to further easing last week. Investors are worried it will continue to suck out any brightness from the banking sector’s outlook like a black hole.After a disappointing May that saw bank stocks retreat to the levels of early January, the ECB’s commentary on Thursday -- that rates will stay lower for longer -- put pressure on the lenders’ stocks once again. What’s more, a new round of cheap funding for banks might not change the big picture.Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) led by Kian Abouhossein see the sector as a “hostage” to the central bank’s dovish stance and expect a 2% negative earnings per share impact with every 25 basis points additional rate cut. And don’t forget the ever flattening yield curve in the second quarter, implying another 2% to 3% of earnings per share are gone, according to JPMorgan.The central bank didn’t provide clear guidance on the chances of introducing so-called tiering, or the exemption of some lenders’ deposits at the ECB from the impact of negative rates. The message was that it remains possible, but not at present, analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) concluded. Bloomberg economist Maeva Cousin wrote that the re-calibrated rates guidance “increases the likelihood of the ECB unveiling some form of reserve tiering system soon.”Yet, the idea that tiering will be the game changer for banks remains debatable. JPMorgan argues that a shift to even lower rates would be bad for valuations, even with tiering. They calculate a 5% positive impact on the system if all of banks’ excess reserves are exempt from negative rates, thereby merely offsetting the impact of lower rates. That said, the effects may vary from country to country and could be relatively good for German banks.While the terms of the ECB’s new TLTRO program, designed to ensure credit flows to the economy, is considered favorable for lenders it does “not change the outlook for European banks materially,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts led by Jan Wolter said. Still, some companies like Santander (MC:SAN), UniCredit, BBVA (MC:BBVA) or CaixaBank may benefit from continued low funding costs.The broader sector is seen as likely to continue trading in a range, BNP Paribas said. It recommends investors look at option skews as the market is underpricing the downside risks to the banking sector.In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading 0.5% higher ahead of the open today.SECTORS IN FOCUS TODAY:COMMENT:COMPANY NEWS AND M&A:NOTES FROM THE SELL SIDE:TECHNICAL OUTLOOK for Stoxx 600 index:TECHNICAL OUTLOOK for Euro Stoxx 50 index:MAIN RESEARCH AND RATING CHANGES:UPGRADES:DOWNGRADES:INITIATIONS:MARKETS:ECONOMIC DATA (All times CET):"

39,"Jun 09, 2019 09:55PM ET",Exclusive: FCA-Renault revival may hinge on Nissan stake cut - sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) are looking for ways to resuscitate their collapsed merger plan and secure the approval of the French carmaker's alliance partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd , according to several sources close to the companies.Nissan is poised to urge Renault to significantly reduce its 43.4% stake in the Japanese company in return for supporting a FCA-Renault tie-up, two people with knowledge of its thinking also told Reuters.It is still far from clear whether any concerted effort to revive the complex and politically fraught deal can succeed. FCA Chairman John Elkann abruptly withdrew his $35 billion merger offer in the early hours of June 6 after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked a vote by its board and demanded more time to win Nissan's backing. Nissan representatives had said they would abstain.The failure, which FCA and Renault blamed squarely on the French government, deprived both companies of an opportunity to create the world's third-biggest carmaker with 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in promised annual synergies.It also shone a harsh light on Renault's relations with Nissan, which have gone from frayed to fried since the November arrest of former alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn, now awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.REVIVAL TALKSItalian-American FCA - whose brand stable encompasses Fiat runabouts, Jeep SUVs, RAM pickups and Maserati sports cars - has so far turned a deaf ear to suggestions by French officials that its merger proposal could be revisited.But since the breakdown, Elkann and his French counterpart Jean-Dominique Senard have had talks about reviving the plan that left the Renault chairman and his Chief Executive Thierry Bollore upbeat about that prospect, three alliance sources said.Renault and a spokesman for FCA declined to comment.One of Elkann's senior advisors on the Renault merger bid, Toby Myerson, was expected at Nissan headquarters in Yokohama on Monday for exploratory discussions with top management, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa is likely to attend. Myerson did not respond to a message from Reuters seeking comment.The meeting comes amid mounting strains that may preclude compromise, after Senard warned Saikawa that Renault was prepared to block key Nissan governance reforms in a dispute over board committees.Alternatively, the escalating tensions and negotiating positions could give way to a breakthrough, as FCA-Renault's industrial logic and savings prove hard to ignore.REBALANCING ACTSaikawa, who has argued consistently that alliance shareholdings need ""rebalancing"" to reflect Nissan's superior size, would press for a substantial reduction to Renault's stake as part of any agreement, according to the same people. Nissan's 15% stake in Renault carries no voting rights.""If FCA are expecting some sort of negotiation, they must be anticipating that request,"" said one.The FCA-Renault deal that Elkann whipped off the table – at least for now – would have seen both companies acquired by a listed Dutch holding company owned 50-50 by current FCA and Renault shareholders, after payment of a 2.5 billion euro special dividend to FCA shareholders.Paris had secured stronger job guarantees and terms including a cash payment to Renault shareholders, following public criticism that the bid undervalued Renault.For Nissan, however, the merger would ""swap out one small 43% shareholder for a bigger 43% shareholder it doesn't know,"" said a source familiar with top management thinking. Nissan could back the FCA-Renault deal only with a ""substantial reduction"" in the French carmaker's holding, they said.France may not automatically oppose a reduction to the Nissan holding if it secured Renault's place at the heart of a consolidated group. The government has also said it could reduce its own 15% Renault holding, to the same end.""All options can be considered,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Figaro after the deal collapsed, when asked about Japanese pressure for Renault to reduce its Nissan stake.But a senior ministry official declined to elaborate on that possibility. ""The proposal is gone,"" he said.FCA may also be prepared to compromise for a tie-up that promises to plug the technology gaps threatening its ability to keep pace with vehicle electrification and emissions compliance.It has few other potential partners, after talks with Peugeot maker PSA ended inconclusively earlier this year. Estimated FCA-PSA synergies were closer to 3 billion euros, according to one person briefed on the matter.FCA has already floated a call option that would allow Nissan to increase its 7.5% voting stake in the combined FCA-Renault, another person involved in the talks said.Nonetheless, anything beyond a token reduction of Renault's Nissan stake would likely upset the deal valuations and prove unpalatable to its prospective merger partner.""It's not something FCA would want to reduce,"" the same person said. ""It's an intrinsic part of the value of Renault.""Elkann and Senard had planned to press ahead with a merger agreement and formal talks over Nissan's abstention, in the belief that the deal economics would compel it to follow and cooperate, sources close to the Renault board have said.By blocking that strategy at the eleventh hour, the French state may have handed the Japanese company a new negotiating opportunity. One thing Renault and Nissan can agree on is that any window to revive the merger is likely to be short.""If there's going to be a deal it will probably be in weeks rather than months,"" one alliance executive said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Renault owns 43% of Nissan, while Nissan has a 15% stake in its French partner.Le Maire will visit Tokyo on Monday to meet with business leaders and government officials including Finance Minister Taro Aso.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""But despite their relationship and banking experience, it all fell apart.""Cole was directly involved in the negotiations on behalf of Renault and had Goldman's chairman of investment banking, FX de Mallmann, as his counterpart representing FCA.The pair worked closely with another former Goldman banker, Laurent Clarenbach, who spent 10 years at the Wall Street bank between 2001 and 2011 and is now a partner at French boutique bank d'Angelin & Co.London-based d'Angelin, launched by French banker Benoit d'Angelin in 2017, was brought in by FCA to help market the 33 billion euro ($37 billion) deal to the French government given his founder's close ties with French President Emmanuel Macron.The French government owns 15% of Renault and was immediately seen as a major obstacle to getting a deal done.But advisers at both sides of the negotiating table were bullish about finding an agreement.""Their long-lasting friendship and mutual trust played a role in keeping them upbeat, even when Paris starting demanding more control over the merged entity,"" one source close to the deal said.TACTICS ""BACKFIRED""Ardea Partners and Goldman often help each other on business and share work for high profile clients. They are currently advising advertising giant WPP (LON:WPP) on its ongoing sale of data analytics unit Kantar. Ardea's executive team mainly consists of former Goldman bankers including James Del Favero, who spent 26 years at the Wall Street bank.The Goldman network had been expected to secure the backing of Macron's government before the deal became public, several sources said, adding Goldman deployed staff from its New York, Paris and London offices in a bid to win France's blessing.But, this time, Goldman and its allies failed to deliver, amid demands for more control by the French state and resistance from Renault's alliance partner Nissan, which decided to abstain from a Renault board vote on the deal.""They couldn't navigate the complexity of this deal and their plan of sidelining Nissan backfired,"" the first source said.Goldman declined to comment on this report, while Ardea Partners was not immediately available for comment.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire demanded that, as one of the main conditions for talks to progress, the deal needed the backing of Nissan.But FCA and its banks did not lay the groundwork to secure Nissan's endorsement, having kept the Japanese carmaker in the dark about the merger plan to avoid leaks. ""It was an ill-conceived deal from the start,"" said a source close to Nissan. ""FCA's advisers thought they could corner Nissan and secure France's approval in a couple of days.

45,"Jun 06, 2019 12:30PM ET",The Deal That Ran Out of Road: How the Fiat-Renault Merger Died,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Shortly after 9 p.m., as the sun began to set on the rotund glass facade housing  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s headquarters on the outskirts of Paris, the board called a break. The group had gathered for the second time in as many days to sign off on a proposed merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. As the talks dragged on, a delegate for the state asked to liaise with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who was having dinner back in town at his hulking ministry protruding into the River Seine.Le Maire laid down a red line for Martin Vial, his representative at the table and the voice of Renault’s biggest and most powerful shareholder. France wanted a commitment from Renault partner Nissan Motor Co. to back the combination. Abstention -- as signaled earlier by the Japanese side -- wasn’t good enough, Le Maire said, fearing that Nissan might begin undermining the alliance if it couldn’t be held accountable with a firm vote.Back in the conference room, the servings of sushi and pizza sourced by security guards had lost their appeal by the time the group reconvened around 11 p.m. The mood, too, was drab. It quickly became clear that Nissan would, in fact, abstain in a vote. When the turn came to Vial to speak, he presented the panel with the government’s game plan.The minister saw an opening to get Nissan on board: over the weekend, G-20 finance ministers are gathering in Fukuoka, Japan, and Le Maire wanted to use his persuasive powers to win over the Japanese partner. Then, to everyone’s surprise and some annoyance, Vial suggested they postpone the vote and reconvene the following week after Le Maire had returned.No More PatienceOver in Italy, meanwhile, John Elkann’s patience was wearing thin. The scion of the Agnelli family and disciple of the late Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne was also getting updates on the meeting back in Paris, and to him, this latest government curve ball was one too many. Elkann had spent weeks stitching together the deal with Renault CEO Jean-Dominique Senard, keeping the French government closely informed, and felt that he had met their demands at every turn. An hours-long board meeting on Tuesday had ended without a vote because representatives wanted more time, and now Elkann’s appetite for further delays was exhausted.After a brief phone conversation with Senard back in Paris, the 43 year-old orchestrated a stunning maneuver. He gathered the Fiat Chrysler board members for a quick meeting, where the group decided to withdraw its proposal to merge. Shortly after 1 a.m., the company sent a terse release, all but blaming the French government for the decision by saying the country lacked the “political conditions” to support the accord.And so imploded one of the most ambitious global mergers in recent years, less than two weeks after it was first disclosed, an audacious plan to emulsify diverse car brands from France, the U.S., and Italy into the world’s No. 3 -- with the promise of reaching the pinnacle if Japan could later be brought into the fold.This account of the final days of the negotiations leading up to the midnight breakdown is based on accounts from people close to the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The carmakers and the government declined to comment on the meetings.Good RelationshipIn the run-up to the shocking collapse, all sides had appeared on a path to get the deal through. Elkann and Senard had built a close rapport in recent weeks, frequently meeting in Paris or Turin for informal gatherings to hammer out the finer points. The two European companies also made sure to keep the door open for Nissan should the Japanese partner want to join the group at a later stage.The French government, with its 15% stake in Renault that comes with powerful double voting rights, also showed support, albeit with some strings attached: the merger should function within the Renault-Nissan framework and not jeopardize the successful partnership; jobs and production sites in France needed to be protected; governance should be maintained; and the group should participate in a project to create a European battery champion.Nissan’s role in particular was an important sticking point for the government. Senard traveled to Japan in the week after the deal was disclosed for an alliance board meeting, where he took the opportunity to lay out the virtues of the combination with Fiat. France wanted Nissan firmly behind the deal, fearing that any opposition -- or even just lukewarm support -- would risk alienating a cherished industrial partner over time.But as the Renault board prepared to meet on June 4 at the headquarters, Nissan’s position became increasingly precarious. CEO Hiroto Saikawa said the Japanese company needed to review the future of the alliance, including contractual relationships, culminating in Nissan’s decision to abstain from a vote. In the end, the first gathering wrapped up without any firm outcome, the group having spent an hour instead poring over the latest findings linked to disgraced former CEO Carlos Ghosn. They agreed to reconvene the next day.Weary HeadsBy the time the panel regrouped at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, the weariness of the inconclusive meeting had blown over, and optimism set in that the second attempt would push things along. A press conference had been tentatively arranged in Paris for the following day, the release all but prepared and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley flying in from the U.S. for the occasion. The French CGT labor union was the only negative voice at the table, but one that could be easily drowned out from the overwhelming chorus of support.Then the great plan came crashing down, with Bloomberg News reporting in the small hours of Thursday that Fiat had withdrawn its offer.The French government, for its part, was stunned by Elkann’s move, and needed a few hours to regain its footing. When it did, the blame game didn’t take long to erupt. Unwilling to be seen as the disrupting factor, the government said it hadn’t closed any doors, and that all it had asked for was another five days to win over Nissan. Topics like valuation, governance and jobs had been agreed upon, a French official told reporters during a briefing.Renault, too, lamented the breakdown of the negotiations, thanking Nissan for its “constructive approach” to the deliberations and Fiat for its efforts. Fiat, on the other hand, saw the French state as the culprit, saying the government repeatedly attempted to change conditions for its support and leaving Elkann with the impression that the state was clamoring for full control of the combined entity, a demand that was unacceptable to Fiat.“When it becomes clear that the discussions have been taken as far as they can reasonably go, it is necessary to be equally decisive in drawing matters to a close,” Elkann said in a letter to employees.In doing so, Elkann took a page from the deal book of his mentor Marchionne, who died last year following an illness and who had been a tireless champion of consolidation in the automotive industry.“It’s as important to walk away from the table as it is to sit down,” Marchionne said in 2014.(Updates with comment from Elkann letter in third-to-last paragraph.)"
46,"Jun 06, 2019 11:01AM ET",France seeks to fend off blame for FCA-Renault deal collapse,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Giulio PiovaccariPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - France was battling to defend its business strategy on Thursday after being blamed for scuppering a $35 billion-plus merger between carmakers Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) only 10 days after the plan was officially announced.Shares in Italian-American FCA and France's Renault fell sharply in early trade after FCA pulled out of talks, saying ""the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully.""The collapse of the deal, which would have created the world's third-biggest carmaker behind Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), revives questions about how both FCA and Renault will meet the challenges of costly investments in electric and self-driving cars on their own. The French government, which has a 15% stake in Renault, had welcomed the merger plan, but overplayed its hand by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that eventually exhausted the patience of FCA, sources familiar with the talks said. Wrong-footed by FCA's decision to withdraw its merger proposal late on Wednesday, a French official called FCA Chairman John Elkann early on Thursday to see if he might reconsider, but was rebuffed, one of the sources said. While France has a long history of government interference in business, President Emmanuel Macron came to power promising a broadly market-friendly agenda. The failure of the FCA deal risks leaving Renault locked into Europe's stagnant mass-market for cars, and deterring other potential suitors, analysts said.NISSAN FACTORFrench finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday the government had engaged constructively, but had not been prepared to back a deal without the endorsement of Renault's current alliance partner Nissan.Nissan had said it would abstain at a Renault board meeting to vote on the merger proposal.The merger had aimed to achieve 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in annual synergies, with FCA gaining access to Renault's superior electric drive technology and the French firm getting a share of FCA's lucrative Jeep and RAM brands. Achieving the planned 5 billion euros in FCA-Renault synergies would depend partly on access to technology jointly owned by Nissan, executives had said.However, a source close to FCA played down the significance of Nissan's stance in the discussions and blamed the French government for succumbing to political pressure at home. The FCA-Renault talks were conducted against the backdrop of a French public outcry over 1,044 layoffs at a  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) factory. The U.S. company had promised to safeguard jobs there when it acquired France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in 2015.FCA has long been looking for a merger partner, and some analysts say its search for a deal is becoming more urgent as it is ill-prepared for tougher new regulations on emissions. It previously held unsuccessful talks with Peugeot maker PSA Group, in which the French state also owns a stake.""We remain open to any industrial consolidation opportunity, but without rushing in order to guarantee the industrial interests of Renault and the French nation,"" Le Maire told the Senate in a weekly government questions session.However, Evercore ISI analysts said the chances of a deal with FCA had ""materially fallen.""Renault said in a statement it was disappointed not to be able to pursue the merger, but that FCA's interest highlighted the attractiveness of the company and its alliance with Nissan. BLAME GAMEThe collapse of the deal could further fray relations between Renault and Nissan, already strained by the arrest and ouster of alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is now facing trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.Nissan, which is 43% owned by Renault and has recently rebuffed a full merger proposal from its French partner, was blindsided by the FCA-Renault tie-up plan and said it would require a fundamental review of its relationship with Renault.""How can we support the deal?"" said a Nissan management source soon before the talks collapsed. ""We weren’t at the table, so we haven’t had time to evaluate its impact on Nissan and the alliance.""The deal's failure could also add to financial markets' frustration with France. ""With FCA pulling its merger offer, one has to wonder how much the French state is set on limiting Renault’s strategic and valuation opportunities despite having only a 15% stake,"" analysts at brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.At 1450 GMT, Renault shares were down 7.1% at 52.19 euros, while FCA shares in Milan had recovered most of their early losses to trade down 0.1% at 11.61 euros. Nissan shares had earlier closed down 1.7% PSA shares, meanwhile, were up 1.9%, as some analysts speculated it could again be targeted by FCA. But one banker who has worked on several FCA and car industry deals in the past said: ""There are few alternatives available for FCA, I think they’ll try again with Renault.""The collapse of the FCA-Renault deal also followed days of bickering between France and Italy over Paris's demands. ""When politicians try to intervene in economic matters, it doesn't always help.

47,"Jun 06, 2019 10:14AM ET",Ford to close engine plant in Wales in latest blow to UK car sector,nan,"By Costas PitasLONDON (Reuters) - Ford said it would close its plant in Bridgend, south Wales next year because of falling demand for some of its engines, putting 1,700 jobs at risk in a further blow to Britain's once booming car industry.Ford, which will take a roughly $650-million pre-tax charge to cover the cost of closing the plant, is making cuts in several countries to turn around loss-making operations in a stagnating European car market.The U.S. automaker has also repeatedly warned the UK government that it needs free trade to be maintained with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc, but said Thursday's announcement ""has nothing to do with Brexit"".Production of Ford's 1.5-litre petrol engine, which has seen lower demand, will end in February, whilst a contract to supply Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) finishes in September 2020. Britain's once thriving car sector, rebuilt since the 1980s mainly by foreign carmakers, has suffered slumps in sales, output and investment over the past two years.""Changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead,"" said Ford Europe President Stuart Rowley.The Bridgend plant, which opened in 1977, built around 20 percent of Britain's 2.7 million automotive engines last year.Ford said it was committed to its other British engine factory in Dagenham, east London. The firm builds a total of 1.3 million engines in Britain which are exported for fitting in vehicles in Germany, Turkey, the United States and elsewhere.Britain's biggest trade union vowed to fight the factory closure. ""We will resist this closure with all our might, and call upon the governments at the Welsh Assembly and Westminster to join us to save this plant,"" said Len McCluskey, head of the Unite union. Ford said in January a turnaround of its European operations would involve cutting thousands of jobs, possible plant closures and discontinuing loss-making vehicle lines.It is axing more than 5,000 jobs in Germany and more than 500 white-collar roles in Britain. Workers have long pushed for Bridgend to produce hybrid technology and electric vehicle components alongside a new third-party manufacturer to fill any surplus space but such investment has not been forthcoming. ""Significant efforts to identify new opportunities have not been successful,"" said Ford. The Ford plant closure is the latest blow to the sector this year. JLR has said around 4,500 mainly British jobs would go and Honda has said up to 3,500 roles would be axed when it closes its British plant in 2021. A series of investment decisions are also pending as sales continue to slide, including whether Peugeot parent PSA will keep its Ellesmere Port plant open and if JLR will choose to make electric cars in Britain. British car sales are down 3.1 percent so far this year, after falling in 2017 and 2018. Ford is among many major carmakers which are opposed to a no-deal Brexit, fearing it could add tariffs and customs checks to their vehicles, engines and components, raising costs.Thursday's announcement, a day after the U.S. President left Britain and as the governing Conservatives pick a new leader, comes as French politicians are scrambling to fend off blame for the collapse of a proposed merger of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Trump doubles down on tariffsU.S. President Donald Trump emphasized the need for his tariff policies on both China and Mexico, while insisting that he felt the two countries wanted to make a deal.Trump said he could increase tariffs on China by “at least $300 billion” and promised he would “do that at the right time”, according to a Reuters report.The president also tweeted overnight that progress was being made in talks with Mexico and will continue on Thursday. He indicated, however, the progress was “not nearly enough” and confirmed that 5% tariffs would go into effect next week with monthly increases following.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday that, while the IMF did not expect the disputes to lead to a global recession, she did believe they could decelerate growth.2. U.S. growth, jobless claims in focusWith market focus on the global economic slowdown, the IMF will present its annual review of the U.S. economy in Washington at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) on Thursday. A pessimistic reading appeared unlikely given Lagarde’s description of a “strong U.S. economy” in her Wednesday interview.On the data front, attention will center on weekly jobless claims ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report. Data from private payroll processor ADP showed Wednesday that job creation hit a nine-year low in May. Despite the worse-than-expected number, markets cheered the “bad news” as fuel for the Federal Reserve to embark on policy easing.Read more: Don't Fear The First Rate Cut...It May Be Different This Time - Urban Carmel3.

53,"Jun 06, 2019 04:45AM ET",StockBeat: Renault Left Exposed as Fiat Balks at French State Meddling,nan,"by Geoff SmithInvesting.com - A successful, global car alliance cannot be run by French politicians and bureaucrats.That seems to be the message that Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) has sent with the sudden withdrawal of its offer to merge with Groupe  Renault  (PA:RENA).“It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully,” FCA said in a stinging press release, after the French government representatives on Renault’s board asked to delay a vote on accepting the merger terms.The government delegates and a French labor representatives were the only board members opposed to the deal, according to the Financial Times. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire had already pushed the envelope by seeking more guarantees on keeping as much as possible of the company’s future activity in France, despite initially signalling its approval for the deal.The Wall Street Journal reported people close to the U.S.-Italian company as seeking to “move the goalposts” and wanting the last word on everything.The collapse of the talks leaves everyone worse off, but hits Renault worst. It’s down 7.0% as of 4.30 AM (0830 GMT), while FCA is up 0.6%.The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 meanwhile, was up 0.6% at 376.30, on growing signs of support for markets from central banks (India’s cut interest rates earlier Thursday, while many expect the ECB to loosen its stance further later). The CAC 40 was up 0.7% and the FTSE MIB up 1.0%.Not only has FCA called it out publicly for being stuck in a nationalist-dirigiste time warp, but it has done so after Renault’s management offended long-time alliance partner Nissan by not telling it about the FCA talks. (Nissan’s complaints about a breach of trust will meet with wry smiles in France after Japan’s treatment of Carlos Ghosn in the last few months.)Le Maire told BFMTV Wednesday that it‘s worth taking time to get things right. He’s due in Japan for a G20 meeting at the weekend and will no doubt take the opportunity to press the case for Renault’s merger offer to Nissan that the Japanese rejected.Sequencing is all: a formal combination of the French and Japanese companies would give them the whip hand in any subsequent talks with FCA. By contrast, Nissan would have lost bargaining power with its European partner, had the FCA-Renault merger gone ahead.One thing is certain: the strategic rationale for combining has not gone away, as the costs of transitioning to an electric and autonomous car future are not getting any less (witness BMW’s announcement yesterday on cooperating with Jaguar Land Rover on electric engines and powertrains).The talks will almost certainly be revived in one form or another. The issue for both companies in the meantime is how they can strengthen their own positions in the meantime, in a global market that is stuttering badly."

In the past six races, we were very strong in the corners but lost time on the straights,"" said principal Toto Wolff.""This will make Canada a huge challenge for us as the track characteristics could favor our opponents - there are many long straights, and fewer corners in which to make up lap time.""Hamilton, who took the first Formula One win of his career at the circuit with McLaren in 2007, indicated after winning the previous race in Monaco that a Mercedes engine upgrade was expected.While Mercedes have kept a lid on their plans, the timing would be right since the rules allow each driver three engines per season and Canada comes a third of the way through the 21-race championship.Ferrari,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Honda have already introduced their upgraded engines.A main concern for the champions will be tire management, with Hamilton struggling on the wrong choice in Monaco.""We need to learn from Monaco... because this situation in Montreal, you lose the race,"" Wolff told reporters at the time, cautioning also against too much confidence after such an unprecedented start to the campaign.""We must never be carried away by saying we are just flying at the moment and it's going to continue like this,"" said the Austrian.Ferrari were out of sorts in Monaco, despite Vettel finishing second for the team's best result so far this season, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen posing the biggest threat to Hamilton but hit with a time penalty.""It's a fun track, at least you can overtake if needed and I always enjoy going there,"" said Verstappen, who was third in Canada last year behind second-placed Bottas.""I expect Ferrari to be more competitive in Canada, so for us it may be a bit more difficult, but as always we will try and maximize the result.""Bottas, beaten into third in Monaco after a pitlane clash with Verstappen that cost him second place and Mercedes a sixth successive one-two, will be fired up to claw back points from Hamilton.

BMW already has a deal to supply an 8 cylinder engine to Jaguar Land Rover.Carmakers are increasingly open to sharing electric car parts because the technology is expensive and because customers no longer buy a car based on what engine a vehicle has.

Jaguar Land Rover said it would redouble efforts to cut costs after it posted a $4 billion loss earlier this year, hit by a downturn in demand for sports utility vehicles in China and a regulatory clampdown on diesel emissions.BMW bought Britain's Rover Group, which included the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, for 800 million pounds in 1994 only to sell Jaguar Land Rover to Ford in March 2000 for $2.7 billion.

61,"Jun 04, 2019 09:51AM ET",FCA-Renault tie-up clears French hurdles before board meeting: sources,nan,"By Arno Schuetze and Laurence FrostFRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler has resolved key differences with France over its proposed merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA), three sources told Reuters on Tuesday, as the French carmaker's board met to review the $35 billion tie-up plan.The compromise on French government influence over a combined FCA-Renault may clear the way for Renault directors to approve a framework agreement and begin the long process of a full merger, unless new issues surface at their meeting.France, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15% stake, had been pressing for its own guaranteed seat on the new board and an effective veto on future CEO appointments.But after late-night talks with John Elkann, the Italian-American carmaker's chairman, officials approved a compromise giving the French government one of four board seats allocated to Renault, balanced by four FCA appointees, the sources said.Renault would also cede one of its two seats on a four-member CEO appointment committee to the French state, they said.With Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, 66, set to become FCA-Renault's first operational chief under Elkann's chairmanship, the move gives France a formal say on the appointment of his successor.Renault, FCA and the French government, which have been locked in talks over the offer pitched by FCA to create the world's third-biggest carmaker, declined comment.The proposal would see both carmakers acquired by a listed Dutch holding company owned 50-50 by current FCA and Renault shareholders, after payment of a 2.5 billion euro ($2.8 billion) special dividend to FCA shareholders.Responding to criticism from some analysts and French industry leaders that the deal undervalued Renault and its 43.4% stake in Nissan, Paris pushed for better terms.This bore fruit over the weekend, as FCA discussed concessions including a dividend to Renault shareholders, stronger French job guarantees and a Paris-based regional headquarters for the combined group.JOB UNDERTAKINGSFCA and Renault shares rose on the news of the board compromise, and were up 4.5 percent and 5.2 percent respectively at 1240 GMT.""The market has been worried that too much could be given away, and there's a price to be paid for execution risk,"" a source close to the negotiations said. ""The more our hands are tied the harder it is to achieve meaningful synergies.""The possible dividend was still being discussed shortly before the Renault board convened at 1300 GMT, people close to the talks said. Firm undertakings on French jobs and sites as well as the Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters site are likely to be worked out later in the process, they added.The FCA-Renault talks are playing out amid a French public outcry over 1,044 layoffs at a  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) site in Belfort, eastern France - where the U.S. group had promised to safeguard jobs on acquiring  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in 2015.""After the mess with GE, the government was determined to get binding agreements on jobs,"" a source close to Renault said. ""And they will. The state has made itself heard.""Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has also stressed that the FCA-Renault deal must preserve Renault's existing alliance with Nissan - already strained by the arrest and ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.Nissan's two Renault board representatives are expected to abstain in any vote on Tuesday, sources at both companies said, a day after the Japanese carmaker's CEO Hiroto Saikawa warned that the proposed merger would trigger a ""fundamental review"" of its relationship with Renault.Achieving 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in FCA-Renault synergies would depend partly on access to technology jointly owned by Nissan, executives acknowledge.A Renault board decision to approve the merger proposal, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, would begin a process expected to last well into 2020. FCA and Renault would aim to put the tie-up to shareholder votes in the first quarter, one source close to the talks said.

Fiat Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley is in Paris ahead of the vote, which would stop short of approving a merger.Renault’s path toward a deal with Fiat was muddied on Monday by Nissan, which holds a 15% stake in the French manufacturer as part of their two-decade auto-making alliance. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said the company needs to review the future of their partnership, including contractual relationships, in light of Renault’s potential tie-up with Fiat.Fiat Chrysler’s proposal for a 50-50 Dutch holding company would create the world’s third-biggest car maker, adding scale to help the companies share costs and resources while tackling an expensive shift to electrification and autonomous driving. Shares of both Fiat and Renault climbed early Tuesday.While Nissan can’t block a Fiat-Renault combination, the Yokohama-based company could use its strong presence in China, Japan and the rest of Asia, as well as its electric-car technology, as leverage. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has also said he wants any combination with Fiat to come within the framework of the Franco-Japanese alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp.‘Fundamental Review’“The potential addition of FCA as a new member of the alliance could expand the playing field for collaboration and create new opportunities for further synergies,” Saikawa said in his statement. “That said, the proposal currently being discussed is a full merger which — if realized — would significantly alter the structure of our partner Renault. This would require a fundamental review of the existing relationship between Nissan and Renault.”The French government, Renault’s most powerful shareholder, is also making demands. It wants additional guarantees from Fiat to avoid job cuts in France and other steps to protect national interests, people familiar with the matter have said.France is seeking operational headquarters of the combined company in Paris, and a special dividend for shareholders of Renault, which owns a 43% stake in Nissan, as well as a French government seat on the new company’s board, a finance ministry spokesman said.Le Maire is also seeking guarantees on the mandate of Senard. The minister’s office wants Senard, 66, to have the CEO role for at least four years, one of the people said.Representatives for Renault and Fiat Chrysler have declined to comment.The deal would benefit Fiat more than Renault, Paris-based activist investment manager CIAM said in a letter to Renault board members ahead of the vote. The French carmaker’s industrial assets have a negative implied value of 3 billion euros under the terms of the proposed deal. Based on earnings before interest and taxes, they should be valued at 6.75 billion euros, according to the Renault shareholder.Under terms of the proposal, Renault shareholders including the French government, which owns a 15% stake, would get an implied premium of about 10%, while Fiat owners would get dividends to account for its higher equity value. Renault shares rose as much as 3.9% by 1:22 p.m. in Paris, while Fiat climbed 3.2% in Milan, giving the firms a combined market capitalization of about 34.2 billion euros ($38.5 billion).The relationship between Renault and Nissan has been strained by the fallout from the arrest of their former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, in November. Mitsubishi Chairman Osamu Masuko has said he would need more time to determine the benefits, if any, for the Japanese automaker of the Renault-Fiat merger."

""If it drifts back towards a quasi-French nationalized business, things may start to fall apart.""In Italy, where the government has consistently said it supports the deal, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's right-wing League Party expressed annoyance with the French position.France should sell its Renault stake to meet EU deficit limits rather than seek more influence, the party's economics spokesman Claudio Borghi said. ""By what right, in the Europe of liberalism and privatizations, can the French state negotiate seats on the board of a car company?""FCA and Renault have also stressed they want to preserve the Renault-Nissan alliance - already strained by the arrest and ouster of chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is now facing trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said on Monday the carmaker would conduct a ""fundamental review"" of its relationship with Renault if its tie-up with FCA went through. However, he conceded that FCA's arrival could bring ""opportunities for further synergies"".The claimed 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in cost and investment savings would depend partly on FCA access to technology jointly owned by Nissan, executives acknowledge.Renault had no comment on Saikawa's statement, company spokesman Frederic Texier said. But a source close to the French carmaker's board said it could have been worse.""If you want to say no, you say no,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

66,"Jun 03, 2019 02:10PM ET","In Chrysler, France May Be Served a Slice of Corporate Americana",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Chrysler has bounced around between different owners for the better part of two decades. Next up: the French government.If a board meeting slated for Tuesday goes according to plan and seals the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), the French government will end up owning a 7.5% sliver of the combined group. And while there are plenty of French companies owning U.S. household names -- think luxury house LVMH or advertising giant  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) -- the involvement of the state in a storied U.S. consumer brand is still an unusual corporate development.That the French government would ascend to a stakeholder in Chrysler is testament to the twists and turns that have characterized the U.S. carmaker’s winding corporate road, as well as France’s long history as a Renault shareholder. Founded in 1925, Chrysler ascended to the Big Three that dominated American roads for decades, though it’s long been the scrappy player trailing behind General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).Germany’s  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) bought the company in 1998, only to unceremoniously divest less than a decade later amid mounting losses. Following the global recession, Chrysler combined with Fiat SpA, which has managed to turn the business around.Among the company’s stable of products is the Jeep, which has a cult following among U.S. consumers and dates back to World War II, when the U.S. government solicited bids for a four-wheel drive vehicle to ferry soldiers over rugged European terrain. Chrysler’s lineup also includes Ram pickup trucks and Dodge Charger and Challenger muscle cars that have graces American garages for decades.In the past, Chrysler churned out oversize, gas-guzzling LeBaron sedans and Plymouth station wagons. In many ways, that history runs counter to France’s auto industry, which built a reputation for zippy and quirky cars like the Citroen DS, Renault R4 and Espace or the Peugeot 504, a rugged and boxy station wagon popular in far-flung places like Africa.Under the 34 billion-euro planned Franco-Italian deal, the French state’s 15% stake in Renault will be cut in half. While that might sound like a diminished role, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is still pushing for guarantees on French jobs and factories, as well as future influence. Paris is also pressing for boardroom representation along with operational headquarters for the combined company in France and the nomination of Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard as chief executive officer for four years, Bloomberg News has reported.U.S. President Donald Trump has been mum about the potential deal. The “America first” leader has been a cheerleader for Detroit’s carmakers, with the exception of when they’ve closed plants or plotted investments in Mexico. He cheered Fiat Chrysler earlier this year for adding jobs in Michigan, but the company continues to operate several factories south of the border and recently cut a shift of workers at a plant in Illinois.If the Renault board gives the green light to the deal, Jeep and Ram would become part of a broad mix of brands and nameplates, ranging from Italian marques Maserati and Alfa Romeo to the diminutive Fiat 500 and compact Renault Clio. Fiat’s founding shareholder, the Agnelli family’s holding company Exor NV, would be the single largest investor."
67,"Jun 03, 2019 06:55AM ET","Exclusive: Nissan optimistic about FCA partnership, but wants right terms, source says",nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is optimistic about partnering with a combined  Renault  and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), as long as it can protect the ownership of technology developed over two decades of working with Renault, a senior executive told Reuters.The executive, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said he was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of generating ""synergies"" by sharing Nissan's autonomous drive know-how, electrification and greenhouse-gas-scrubbing technologies for powertrains.But he said the possible $35 billion merger of Renault SA (PA:RENA) and FCA would not give FCA the automatic right to use those technologies, which it needs to meet stringent emissions regulations and better compete in a industry being transformed by electric vehicles.He also floated the possibility that Nissan could look at boosting its stake in Renault, or a merged Renault-FCA, to gain more say in shaping the future of the alliance. ""We would go ahead with partnering or cooperating with FCA only if we can guarantee tangible benefits from sharing technologies with FCA and only if we can work out conditions that are satisfactory to us,"" the Yokohama-based executive said.""If Renault wants to pursue this deal, we feel we need to look seriously at supporting them,"" he said.The executive's comments highlight how Nissan could look to leverage its advanced technology to gain greater bargaining power with a merged Renault-FCA. Renault is Nissan's top shareholder with a 43.4% shareholding, while Nissan holds a 15% non-voting stake in the French automaker. That unequal partnership has long rankled Nissan, which is the bigger company by far. A Nissan spokesman referred Reuters to a statement issued on Monday, where Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said: ""I believe that the potential addition of FCA as a new member of the alliance could expand the playing field for collaboration and create new opportunities for further synergies.""""That said, the proposal currently being discussed is a full merger which—if realized—would significantly alter the structure of our partner Renault. This would require a fundamental review of the existing relationship between Nissan and Renault,"" Saikawa said, adding that Nissan would analyze and consider its ""existing contractual relationships"".BOOSTING STAKE?If technology alone doesn't give Nissan enough leverage in negotiating with Renault and FCA, the executive said Nissan could consider boosting its stake in Renault or the merged FCA-Renault to gain more influence. The executive said Nissan has enough financial and other resources to pursue such an option, but declined to comment further.More than a year ago, Nissan started an early study about possible benefits of adding FCA to the Renault-Nissan alliance, one begun at the instruction of ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the executive said.""There is no doubt there are potentially many opportunities for Nissan to share technology with FCA,"" the executive said, referring to the study.As examples, he pointed to the full-size pickup truck business in the United States between FCA's Dodge and Nissan brands, as well as the possibility of sharing with the Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands the advanced gasoline engine technology Nissan is now using for Infiniti, its premium brand.FCA is discussing a Renault special dividend and stronger job guarantees in a bid to persuade the French government to back its proposed merger between the car makers, Reuters has reported. The deal would create the world's third-largest automaker, but it also raises difficult questions about how Nissan would fit into a radically changed alliance.Despite being long-time alliance partners, the executive noted that Nissan was completely blindsided by news of the FCA deal. ""Renault did not give us the proper heads-up, and that should not have been like that.""Still, he was optimistic that an enlarged alliance could work, at least from Nissan's perspective of sharing its technology.""Cooking a meal for three or four isn't all that different,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The board meets again on Tuesday.Some analysts and French industry leaders had voiced doubts about the 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in claimed cost and investment savings, and whether the proposal represents a fair deal for Renault shareholders.A Renault dividend would improve the valuation in their favor, balancing a 2.5 billion euro proposed dividend to FCA shareholders. The sources did not elaborate on the potential size of a Renault payout.The merger plan presented on Monday would see the two carmakers acquired by a listed Dutch holding company whose ownership would be split equally between current FCA and Renault shareholders, after special dividend payments.FCA had proposed locating the combined group's operational head office in a neutral city, most likely London, but has now indicated readiness to base it in the greater Paris area, meeting a key French government demand, both sources said.The French government is also likely to be granted a seat on the board to reflect its 7.5 percent stake in the merged company, the people said.Nissan, whose matching 15 percent stake in its French alliance partner will also be diluted to 7.5 percent of the new group, receives a board seat under the plan unveiled on May 27.Guarantees to maintain Renault's French blue-collar jobs and industrial sites would also be extended to four years from the two initially proposed under the compromise being discussed, the sources added.Both France's pro-business government and Italy's populist administration back the merger in principle but fraught relations between the two could yet derail the deal if one side feels disadvantaged.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"May 31, 2019 02:17PM ET",Trump's Mexican tariffs threaten to disrupt auto sector,nan,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Georgina ProdhanTOKYO/MILAN (Reuters) - Shares of global automakers and suppliers tumbled on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, potentially upending a global manufacturing business model established decades ago.From Mazda Motor Corp in Japan to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG in Germany to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in the United States, carmaker stocks took a hit as a new front opened in the global trade war. Analysts estimated the proposed duties could cost automakers and suppliers as much as $23 billion, an amount that Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner said ""could cripple the industry.""Automakers and suppliers could try to pass along tariff costs to consumers. Swedish industrial seals and bearings maker SKF, which supplies carmakers in the United States from Mexico, said it would pass on any tariff impact to customers..""Margins are so thin in the U.S. market right now that there's no way that any automaker is not going to pass on these tariffs to their customers,"" said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.However, other analysts said tough competition and slowing demand for vehicles would likely force manufacturers to eat much of the added cost. That in turn could force more cost-cutting by auto sector manufacturers.Major trade groups that represent the Detroit Three automakers and global automakers with U.S. operations criticized the proposed tariffs in statements Friday.""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect – harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment,"" David Schwietert, interim head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in a statement that called tariffs a tax on consumers. Auto trade groups also expressed concern that a tariff war with Mexico would undermine efforts to win congressional approval for a new U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration.Automakers shipped 2.52 million vehicles to the United States from Mexico in 2018, accounting for about 14.6% of total U.S. car and light truck sales, according to IHS Markit, a consulting and market research firm.Railing against a surge of illegal immigrants across the U.S. southern border, Trump said he would target all goods coming from Mexico with a 5% tariff from June 10, increasing monthly to 25% by Oct. 1, unless Mexico took immediate action.""In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA,"" Trump wrote in a tweet on Friday.Auto industry executives have said it would cost billions to abandon factories in Mexico and build replacements in the United States. For years carmakers and auto parts makers have built vehicles and parts in Mexico, taking advantage of its cheap labor, trade deals and proximity to the United States, the world's second largest auto market after China.Mexico now dominates production of certain key automotive components, such as wiring harnesses - the networks of cables that connect on-board computers, brakes, headlights and other electrical systems. Mexico produces 97% of the wiring harnesses used in North American made vehicles, said Peter Nagle, senior automotive economist at IHS Markit. Trump's threat to impose tariffs rattled a number of global companies and industries. In addition to the auto sector, aerospace suppliers, industrial component makers and electronics firms are vulnerable. ""This being escalated at a time when the China situation is not still resolved shows that Trump views tariffs as a weapon he can use without damage to the U.S. economy. That's worrying and sends a bad signal for the outlook for global trade overall,"" said Jon Harrison, a senior macro strategist at TS Lombard.(graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Khd82D)TRADE FLOWSThe latest threat to impose tariffs on millions of vehicles bound for the United States comes two weeks after Trump announced he would delay a decision on imposing up to 25% tariffs on vehicles from the European Union and Japan by up to six months.Automakers shipped $52.6 billion worth of vehicles to the United States from Mexican assembly plants in 2018. Another $32.5 billion in auto parts flowed to the U.S. from Mexican factories, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.Some of the most popular vehicles sold in the United States are made in Mexico, including versions of GM's Chevrolet Silverado pickup, the Chevrolet Blazer SUV, Volkswagen's Jetta sedan and Toyota Motor Corp's Tacoma pickup.SHARE IMPACTTrump's tweet ignited a global sell-off in shares of major auto industry players. In Japan, where Trump's initial tweet threatening tariffs landed as markets were opening, shares in Toyota fell 3% while Nissan dropped 5% and Honda 4%. Mazda took a bigger hit, tumbling 7%. All four operate vehicle assembly plants in Mexico, producing roughly one-third of the vehicles made there.In Europe, potential merger candidates Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) led the carmakers lower, each falling 5%, while automotive supplier Faurecia SE was down 4% in late afternoon trading.In Friday afternoon U.S. trading, shares of GM, Ford and big auto parts makers Delphi Technologies PLC, Aptiv PLC and seat maker Adient PLC all tumbled.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"May 31, 2019 10:16AM ET",Renault board to review FCA merger move on Tuesday,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - The board of  Renault  (PA:RENA) will meet on Tuesday to discuss Fiat Chrysler's merger offer, the French carmaker said, as Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire reiterated the government's conditional support for the tie-up.Renault directors will decide whether to open formal talks with FCA when they reconvene after informal work sessions being held this week, Reuters earlier reported. The meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, a company spokesman said.Italian-American FCA on Monday pitched a $35 billion merger with Renault to create the world's third-biggest carmaker, joining forces to tackle mounting industry challenges including investment-heavy emissions regulation, vehicle electrification, connectivity and driving autonomy.Doubts about the bid's valuation and 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in claimed cost and investment savings have been voiced by former Renault executives including Carlos Tavares, who now leads domestic rival PSA Group, and Patrick Pelata, who served as chief operating officer until 2011.Questions have also arisen over the deal's impact on Renault's partnership with 43.4 percent-owned Nissan, already strained in the wake of the arrest and ouster of their former alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn, now awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.But the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake, reiterated its support for the combination on Friday - on condition that it preserve French industrial jobs and sites, safeguard the alliance with Nissan and sign up to a nascent European battery manufacturing project.FCA's bid presents a ""real opportunity for Renault and the French automotive industry"", Finance Minister Le Maire told domestic news agency Agence France-Presse.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

75,"May 30, 2019 10:54AM ET",Nissan's technology could pay in Renault-FCA deal: sources,nan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Naomi TajitsuBEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan's advanced technologies including platforms and electric powertrains could give it leverage in a merger involving  Renault  and Fiat Chrysler, thanks to a royalty system it has with the former, two people with knowledge of the matter said.A merged Renault-Fiat Chrysler could face an extra hurdle each time it uses technology developed by Nissan Motor Co or Mitsubishi Motors Corp, while the two Japanese automakers stand to gain a client in Fiat Chrysler (FCA), one of the people said. Both sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.Nissan's technology, particularly in electrification and emissions reduction, could give it some sway in the $35 billion potential tie-up between Renault and FCA, even as its stake in the newly formed company would be diluted.Currently Renault SA (PA:RENA) pays less for technology developed by Nissan than the Japanese automaker pays for French technology, a third person said. This has long been a sticking point for Nissan, and an area where Nissan could seek more favorable terms.""Whenever Nissan transfers platform, powertrain or other technology to Renault, there is a margin or royalty which Renault has to pay for use of that tech,"" one of the people said. ""In that sense, FCA, if everything went well, would become another 'client' of ours and that's good. More business for us.""    A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on its royalty system.The potential Renault-FCA deal has complicated the Japanese automaker's already uneasy alliance with Renault. A further deal with Fiat Chrysler looks likely at least in the near term to weaken Nissan's influence in the 20-year-old partnership.Renault owns a 43.4% stake in Nissan and is its top shareholder. Nissan holds a 15% non-voting stake in Renault and would see that diluted to 7.5% after the FCA deal, albeit with voting rights. The imbalance between the two has long rankled Nissan, which is by far the larger company. ALLIANCE IMBALANCERenault had previously angled for a merger with Nissan but has been rebuffed by CEO Hiroto Saikawa. Securing benefits from the merger deal will be important for Saikawa, who is grappling with poor financial performance while he struggles to right the company after the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year.By joining forces, Renault and FCA hope to consolidate what would have been two electric vehicle development programs into one, and then deploy the resulting technology across a much larger range of vehicles, reducing costs.FCA, which foresees trouble in meeting with increasingly stringent emissions regulations in both Europe and China, would likely benefit significantly from Renault powertrain technologies.Much of these technologies have been beefed up by R&D led by Nissan, the first automaker to launch a mass-market all-battery electric vehicle (EV).The Nissan Leaf is the world’s top-selling EV, with sales of more than 400,000 since its launch in 2010.The company has also found unexpected success with its e-Power gasoline hybrid system. It could use its technology as a negotiating tool with Renault and FCA.Technically, any deal between Renault and FCA would not involve any structural change in Renault's confidential partnership agreement with Nissan, the Restated Alliance Master Agreement, although FCA would join Renault as a counterparty to the pact.But Nissan does stand to benefit from a more balanced capital structure in the merger. As the combined Renault-FCA company would be domiciled in the Netherlands, the French government would lose its double shareholding permitted under France's Florange Law.As a result, the French government would be left with a 7.5 percent voting stake in the new company, potentially easing a source of tension between Nissan and Paris, as the current arrangement effectively hands the government outsized influence over the Japanese automaker.REGIONAL COMPETITORS There is also the issue of regional overlap. FCA and Nissan are rivals in the North American truck and SUV market, where Nissan has struggled with poor margins. ""Nissan is struggling in the United States. Will pairing up with Chrysler help? Not really."" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. He said Nissan could seek compromises in other areas if Renault-FCA were to seek consolidation in the region.Southeast Asia, where the third member of the Renault-Nissan alliance - Mitsubishi Motors - dominates vehicle sales, could also be a area for potential horse-trading with Renault and FCA as they expand their presence in the fast-growing market. Here, Mitsubishi could negotiate hefty concessions in return for distribution in Indonesia, Thailand and other countries.""Our main market is the ASEAN countries, so we would like to know how cooperation would look in this region,"" Mitsubishi Motors Chairman Osamu Masuko said on Wednesday.""There are areas where making decisions may be difficult.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

76,"May 30, 2019 02:10AM ET",Renault's Senard Says Jobs and Nissan Will Be Safe in Fiat Deal,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Convincing the stakeholders of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) on the merits of a merger may be the easy part. The hard task is selling the deal to Renault’s alliance partner Nissan Motor Co., (T:7201) as well as labor groups and politicians wary of job cuts.Jean-Dominique Senard, who’s been tapped to lead the combined Franco-Italian carmaker, is in Tokyo to make what may be the sales pitch of his career. In an interview on Thursday, he painted a picture of a grand alliance making and selling cars across the globe, keeping people employed and churning out profits.“It can only happen if people are open to it,” said Senard, 66, who attended a meeting for the board overseeing the alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He came to explain the merits of the Fiat-Renault deal to the Japanese executives, who started Wednesday’s meeting with many questions. By the end, the mood lightened and they were positive, he said.“A closer partnership can only improve the alliance,” Senard said. Nissan, which has pushed back in the past at attempts for closer integration, “understood the message I brought here, although obviously they can’t digest it in one night,” he added.After spending three days in Japan, Senard will return to Europe to work on bringing Fiat Chrysler and Renault together. He doesn’t anticipate any serious regulatory hurdles for the merger. Asked whether the joining of two European automakers would result in job cuts, Senard said the deal ""doesn't call for human sacrifice.""The merger won't involve any plant closures, according to Fiat, although it didn't mention any potential job cuts when the deal was announced. The combination also has the blessing of the Italian and French governments, which are constantly on guard against the risk of labor unrest.The transaction would be structured as a 50-50 ownership through a Dutch holding company, with Renault shareholders, including the French government, getting an implied premium of about 10%. Renault’s board is expected to give preliminary approval to the proposal as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter have said. Senard said on Thursday that the deal will take about a year to complete.Behind the push to consolidate are the various headwinds the industry is facing. Sales are decelerating in the world’s biggest car markets — China, the U.S. and Europe — bringing fresh urgency to consolidate. Automakers worldwide are facing intense pressure to spend heavily on electrification and autonomous vehicles, and adapting to trends such as car-sharing.Renault and Fiat Chrysler estimate cost savings of more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) from the merger. The automakers will focus on reducing platforms, simplifying product lines and focusing on quality and branding, Senard said. ""All of the brands are very famous,"" he said. ""Some have to be re-enhanced.""In order to sell more cars, Senard indicated profit-eroding price cuts in North America by Nissan and Chrysler would have to end. ""It needs to be about quality boosting market share,"" he said.Asked about recent comments by Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Peugeot owner Groupe PSA and former Ghosn protege, calling the deal a ""virtual takeover"" of Renault and that it could weaken or unwind the alliance with Nissan, Senard said: ""Everyone is free to say what they think.""Nissan could be a key part of forging a global group that could produce 15 million vehicles a year. The Yokohama-based company would complement the merged entity because of its strong presence in China, Japan and the rest of Asia, as well as its electric-car technology.There are signs that Senard’s charm offensive is yielding some results. Following the meeting, Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa said he saw potential opportunities for the existing alliance in Fiat Chrysler’s merger proposal, though he plans to study the matter further. As Saikawa put it, “we don’t consider this as a minus.”As to Senard, he said Nissan is already benefiting from the proposed merger given the increase in the Japanese carmaker’s shares on news of the deal. Nissan, 43% owned by Renault, would also finally have more tangible influence by gaining greater say in the alliance, he said.Under the proposed merger of Fiat Chrysler and Renault, Nissan would get 7.5% of the combined entity. The Japanese carmaker would be able to vote with those shares, unlike with its current holdings, which carry no voting rights. A merger would also dilute the French state’s control over Renault, and indirectly over Nissan, easing a concern it has had for years.Nissan needs some good news. The company recently forecast weak operating profit and cut its dividend for the first time in a decade. Senard said Nissan currently needs to focus on its profitability and that it’s in Renault’s interest for its Japanese partner to turn itself around.Fiat also said the combination would help cut costs by an additional 1 billion euros for Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.The alliance was destabilized late last year with the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its architect and chairman, for alleged financial crimes during his time as leader of Nissan. Ghosn has denied all charges and is preparing for his trial next year. Although Nissan and Renault have been partners for two decades, the Japanese automaker isn’t in a position to block the deal because the merger wouldn’t breach terms of their partnership.Senard, who replaced Ghosn as chairman of Renault and the alliance, has sought to restore stability following his predecessor’s arrest. The former  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO worked earlier this year with Nissan to craft a new governance structure to oversee the partnership, giving up concessions over board seats to assuage the Japanese firm’s concerns.""With Nissan, this is the first truly global car alliance,"" Senard said."
77,"May 29, 2019 10:12PM ET","FCA, Renault face tall odds delivering on cost-cutting promises in merger",nan,"By Edward Taylor and Ben KlaymanFRANKFURT/DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) promise huge savings from a mega-merger, but such combinations face tall odds because of the industry’s long product cycles and problems translating deal blueprints into real world success, industry veterans told Reuters.BMW AG's 1994 purchase of Rover, and Daimler AG's 1998 merger with Chrysler Corp both made sense on paper. The companies promised to hike profits by combining vehicle platforms and engine families. Both combinations proved unworkable in reality, and were unwound.Renault and Nissan Motor Co, which have been in an alliance since 1999 designed to share vehicle components, have only managed to use common vehicle platforms in 35% of Nissan's products despite an original target of 70%, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).FCA and Renault have raised the stakes for themselves by ruling out plant closures. That increases the pressure to achieve more than $5 billion in promised annual savings from pooling procurement and research investments. The two companies have yet to fill in many of the blanks in the merger plan put forward by Fiat Chrysler. Renault's board is expected to act soon to accept the proposal, but that would lead only to a memorandum of understanding to pursue detailed operational and financial plans. A final deal and the legal combination of the two companies could take months to complete if all goes well.Pressure to cut automotive pollution is driving the latest round of consolidation. Automakers are looking at multibillion-dollar bills to develop electric and hybrid cars and cleaner internal combustion engines. Fiat Chrysler and Renault are betting they can design common electric vehicle systems, then sell more of them through their respective brands and dealer networks, cutting the cost per car.Developing all-new electric vehicles can bring more opportunities to share costs from the outset, industry experts said.""With the emergence of connected, autonomous, electric and shared vehicles, carmakers face immediate investments, so new opportunities for sharing costs have emerged,” said Elmar Kades, managing director at Alix Partners.However, most electric vehicles lose money. This is a challenge for city car brands in Europe in particular. Both Renault and Fiat rely heavily on this segment for sales.“The economics of cheap small cars are getting harder,"" said Carl-Peter Forster, an auto industry veteran who has worked on numerous transformational car deals, including Tata's management of Jaguar Land Rover, BMW's attempted integration of Rover and Geely's management of Volvo cars. ""Hybrid technology is too expensive in the small value segment and with electrification there is the dilemma of having a large battery which is too expensive or having a battery which is cheaper and small, but offers only limited operating range,” he explained.  He is a former director of Volvo Cars Corp, a non-executive director of Geely Automobile Holdings, a former head of manufacturing at BMW and the former chief executive of Opel.Forster declined to comment on FCA and Renault's proposal but he said in general synergies from sharing platforms and engines take time to translate into tangible benefits for both partners.“The Opel Fiat partnership to develop a new platform for the Fiat Punto and Opel Corsa shows it is possible to do cooperation on architectures and powertrain, but it takes a minimum of three to four years before you even start reaping the benefits,” Forster said. Fiat Chrysler needs to reduce its European fleet average emissions of 124 grams (4.4 oz) of carbon dioxide per kilometer to 93 grams to meet European regulations, a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst said this week. Renault has cleaner engines and thanks to fewer sales of sports utility vehicles, fleet average emissions of 113 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer.Fiat Chrysler said it believes it will meet European fleet average emission thresholds, including by spending up to 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) to acquire regulatory credits from rivals. Investors initially cheered the proposal to combine Renault and Fiat Chrysler. Executives at other companies are cautious of mega-mergers. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG are discussing partnerships across a range of products, geographies and technologies, but are not discussing a full merger.Daimler and Renault-Nissan have shared technology in 13 different projects resulting in cost savings in excess of 2 billion euros. Former Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche, who fought to salvage his company's merger with Chrysler before deciding to unwind the deal in 2007, said he saw no need for large, transformational mergers. ""Both of us had multiple experiences in cooperation, in capital integration, not all of them being positive,"" he said at one of his last joint press conferences with then Renault chief Carlos Ghosn.People will be critical to the merger's success, said Thomas Stallkamp, a former top executive at Chrysler Corp during the stormy period that followed the Daimler takeover.“The real issue is going to be the integration of management and who’s in control and who controls the capital,” Stallkamp said. Adding Nissan and Mitsubishi to the mix would make management's task much harder, he added.""You’d have Renault, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Fiat and Chrysler, that’s just mind boggling. No one in their right mind would try that.""($1 = 0.8985 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The two companies share the same top shareholder, the Agnelli family's Exor holding.Hybrid power units where introduced into Formula One racing in 2014, helping to facilitate the transfer of technology to Ferrari road cars.About 2,000 selected customers from all over the world have been invited to Ferrari between Wednesday evening and Friday to view and reserve the new car, which will be delivered within 12 months. Its price will be announced this week.Other buyers will have to wait more than a year. Ferrari sells over 65% of its cars to clients who already own one.There is also an emerging new breed of premium or high-performance electric sports cars. These so-called supercars include Tesla's upcoming Roadster Founder Series, which will sell for over $200,000 and the Rimac Concept Two, priced in the region of $2 million.Ferrari said last year it planned 15 new models, including hybrids, a utility vehicle and special editions, in its drive to hit mid-term earnings target.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

79,"May 29, 2019 01:36PM ET",Fraught Franco-Italian relations a roadblock risk for Renault-FCA,nan,"By Richard Lough and Giuseppe FontePARIS/ROME (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler's proposed $35 billion merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA) has cheered investors, won conditional support from Paris and Rome and even earned cautious backing from trade unions.Beneath this veneer, however, the bold attempt to create the world's third largest carmaker risks becoming rapidly embroiled in the fraught relationship between France's europhile President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's euroskeptic leaders.For while Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini hailed the proposal as a ""brilliant operation"", Italy's creaking, state-subsidized Fiat factories are likely to bear the brunt of any production-related cost savings.FCA and Renault said this week that more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of annual savings would come mainly from combining platforms, consolidating powertrain and electrification investments and the benefits of increased scale.Salvini and France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who called the deal a ""good opportunity"" to build a European industrial champion able to compete with China and the United States, have both said they want guarantees on local jobs.""It's not every day that I agree with Salvini,"" said Le Maire, whose government appears to hold the trump cards.When it comes to where any job cuts fall, France will be helped by its existing 15 percent holding in Renault, whose superior efficiency at its five French plants makes it better placed to handle a supply glut, the demise of the petrol engine and the investments needed for electric and autonomous vehicles.""It will take many, many years to find real savings and ugly political and operational realities can often swamp the potential of such new entities,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said of the FCA-Renault plan to rival Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).ADVANTAGE FRANCE?As well as Italy's government having to cope with the aftermath of European elections which coincided with news of the FCA-Renault plans, political leaders in Rome were only informed shortly before the deal was made public, an FCA source said.This contrasted with the way the French government was treated, with Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann, a fluent French speaker, letting it know of his merger proposal to Renault weeks ago, a French government official said. It is not clear how advanced the secret talks between the automakers were at this stage or what opportunity Le Maire had to lay down any red lines, but it reflects FCA's need to have President Emmanuel Macron on side.And it gave France time to prepare its position, with Le Maire on Tuesday laying out four conditions for state approval, including protection of French blue-collar jobs.Meanwhile, Italy's Salvini said Rome might buy a stake the new entity to defend domestic interests.Corporate France has been the biggest overseas investor in Italian companies over the past decade with deals totaling $43.3 billion, Refinitiv data shows.Some are closely scrutinized by Rome, which is fretting over the vulnerability of corporate champions such as  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), in which Italian state lender CDP took a direct holding after  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) took a controlling stake.Under the FCA proposal, Elkann, scion of the Agnelli family, would chair the merged group while Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard would likely become CEO, sources say.'ECONOMIC FANTASY'? While Le Maire has appeared well briefed, Italy's leaders seemed blindsided and Salvini's suggestion that Italy could mirror France's stake signaled concerns over Rome's influence. With cash-strapped Italy locked in a renewed row with Brussels over euro zone budget rules, some French officials dismissed talk of an Italian stake as a bluff, with one describing it as ""economic fantasy"".There are signs the effort to save jobs will focus on the factory floor. Le Maire is demanding that no ""industrial jobs or industrial plants"" are axed in France, leaving scope for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as downsizing plants.Indeed, the merger plan dovetails with Macron's push for cross-border industrial champions that have the muscle to compete with Chinese and U.S. rivals of today and the future. Le Maire urged trade unions to look at job creation potential in a company with the financial clout to be a global player in electric battery and self-driving car technology.Macron has stared down unions before, including over the proposed Franco-German merger of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and Siemens rail businesses, which was derailed by antitrust concerns. Even so, it is unclear how realistic the demands for blue-collar job protection are, with ""substantial product and platform overlap in Europe"", UBS analyst David Lense said.Renault has improved the competitiveness of its French plants, shedding 8,000 jobs via voluntary departures since 2013 and paring back production lines to curb excess capacity. It employs 48,000 people in France, with its plants operating at about 70 percent capacity, while Fiat's six plants in Italy struggle. Turin's historic Mirafiori plant, which makes the Maserati Levante SUV, is expected to operate at just 5 percent capacity this year. Only two plants producing between them the Fiat Panda, Fiat 500 X and the popular Jeep Renegade top 50 percent capacity, research group LMC Automotive said. Higher carbon dioxide emissions may also focus attention on FCA's plants as the combined company looks to tackle tightening emissions regulations and far-reaching technological changes.""These challenges are potentially big push backs and are bigger issues for FCA than for Renault, which doesn't need to restructure in France and which has much lower CO2 emissions,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

81,"May 29, 2019 12:36PM ET",Nissan CEO sees no big downside to FCA-Renault merger,nan,"By Maki Shiraki and Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan sees no major downside to partnering with a combined  Renault  and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), it said on Wednesday in a lukewarm endorsement of the proposed $35 billion tie-up, which would complicate an already uneasy alliance.The leaders of Nissan Motor Co, France's Renault SA (PA:RENA) and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp gathered at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama for a scheduled alliance meeting which was overshadowed by FCA's proposal this week for a merger-of-equals with Renault.Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard arrived in Japan on Tuesday to discuss with Nissan the FCA-led proposal to create the world's third-largest automaker. The plan raises difficult questions about how Nissan, which is 43.4% owned by the French automaker, would fit into a radically changed alliance.""Overall, we don't see any particularly negative aspect"" to the planned merger, which was for Renault and FCA to decide, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa told reporters on Wednesday.The alliance members confirmed in a statement that they had ""an open and transparent discussion"" on the proposed deal, which looks designed to tackle the costs technological and regulatory changes, including a shift to electric vehicles.Nissan, which has rebuffed overtures by Renault for a merger despite a 20-year alliance, was blindsided by the talks, sources have told Reuters, stoking concerns that a deal with FCA could weaken Nissan's relations with its French partner.But Mitsubishi Chairman Osamu Masuko said the Japanese partners had not been left in the dark - even as he acknowledged that he was only directly told by Renault for the first time on Wednesday, two days after the deal was announced.The tie-up also poses an additional challenge for Nissan's Saikawa, who is grappling with poor financial performance and an uneasy relationship with Renault after Nissan led the ousting last year of long-standing alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn.There have long been tensions over the imbalance of power in their alliance with Nissan, the bigger company, holding a 15% non-voting stake in Renault.Credit ratings agency Moody's said it was vital for Nissan to stabilize its partnership with Renault to expand operational synergies and improve margins.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"May 29, 2019 04:50AM ET","Exclusive: Arbitration court rejects India's plea in case against Nissan - sources, document",nan,"By Aditi Shah and Sudarshan VaradhanNEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Permanent Court of Arbitration in Singapore has rejected India's argument that the court does not have the jurisdiction to rule on a case brought against India by Japan's Nissan Motor, according to two people and documents reviewed by Reuters.If India had won the plea, the entire case would have been thrown out, said one of the people who has direct knowledge of the matter, adding that the Indian government is now likely to file an appeal with Singapore's Supreme Court.Nissan sent a legal notice to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration in 2016 claiming more than 50 billion rupees ($720 million) in a dispute over incentives it said were due from Tamil Nadu as part of a 2008 agreement to set up a car manufacturing plant in the southern state.The Japanese car maker brought the case against India for alleged violation of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) the country has with Japan. The CEPA gives some protections to Japanese firms investing in India and vice versa.India, which according to the source agreed to have the arbitration in Singapore, filed a plea in 2017 saying the arbitration court in Singapore does not have the authority to rule on the case for many reasons, including that it was a tax-related matter outside the purview of the CEPA with Japan.The international tribunal, in a 140-page order dated April 29, denied India's objections, saying it has the authority to rule on the matter and would hold the final hearing in February 2020 after submission of evidence and arguments from both sides.The order has not previously been reported. Nissan said in a statement it ""continues to work with the government to resolve this matter"". The case is one of a string of arbitration proceedings against India by investors including  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD), Cairn Energy and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) over issues ranging from retrospective taxation to payment disputes.Though India has lost investment treaty arbitration cases in the past, there is no clarity yet on the legal position when it comes to enforcement of awards or rulings, said Moazzam Khan, head of global litigation at law firm Nishith Desai Associates. In the past, however, India has either voluntarily complied or settled the dispute prior to the award, said Khan.If India loses, the final cost to the country would depend on the merits of the case but there have been instances where it has had to pay the entire claim amount and legal costs, he said. SETTLEMENT TALKSIn 2008, when Nissan and its partner France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) agreed to set up a car plant in Chennai, the state government promised several incentives, including tax breaks.Nissan and Renault have invested 61 billion rupees to set up the factory which has an annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles and has created more than 40,000 jobs. Earlier this week, Italian car maker Fiat Chrysler said it has proposed merging with Renault, in a deal which risks leaving Nissan out in the cold.The Japanese car maker in its 2016 notice claimed 29 billion rupees in unpaid incentives from Tamil Nadu and 21 billion rupees in damages, plus interest and other costs.The Tamil Nadu government, meanwhile, has been trying to settle the matter with Nissan since last year but has failed to come to an agreement on the final terms. ""All obligations would be honored,"" said N Muruganandam, principal secretary to Tamil Nadu government's industries department, adding he hopes to finalize a deal within a month.If the two decide to settle, Nissan, which has only about 1% share of India's passenger car market, has the option to withdraw its arbitration case against India.

83,"May 28, 2019 06:42PM ET","How Renault, Fiat Chrysler could save through sharing",nan,"By Paul Lienert(Reuters) - If French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) green-lights a proposed merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the companies almost immediately could begin saving money by consolidating components and basic structures on many of their most popular vehicles, an industry analyst said on Tuesday.The synergies could multiply if they invite Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co, currently Renault's alliance partner, to join the merger, according to a former Renault and Nissan executive.Renault and Italian-American rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are in talks to tackle the costs of far-reaching technological and regulatory changes by creating the world's third-biggest automaker.A Renault-Fiat Chrysler combination ""would mean a greater sharing of parts (which) could really boost the profitability of Fiat Chrysler's smaller vehicles,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president, AutoForecast Solutions.Building similar models on a common vehicle architecture, Fiorani said, ""would give both companies a lot more freedom in manufacturing. They could mix brands and vehicle sizes on the same assembly line, switch vehicles between plants to balance production, and even shift production from one country to another, depending on changes in demand, tariffs or other considerations.""Fiorani said Fiat Chrysler could benefit from sharing the French automaker's expertise in electric vehicles and powertrains, where Renault and Nissan have jointly invested more than $5 billion. These are areas in which Fiat Chrysler has little in the way of components or intellectual property.Another sector that is ripe for consolidation is light commercial vehicles, where Renault and Fiat Chrysler could build a variety of vans in several sizes on common platforms that could be assembled and sold in global markets. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG began their alliance discussions a year ago by focusing on potential collaboration in light commercial vehicles. GETTING NISSAN'S BLESSING Fiorani said Renault's CMF architecture, which was jointly developed with Nissan and underpins many of Renault's passenger cars and crossovers, could be used by Fiat Chrysler on a wide variety of vehicles. As an example, he said the CMF could provide a new foundation for at least five Jeep models, including the Renegade, Compass and Cherokee, which now are based on four different platforms.A hurdle to implementing the merger is all the intellectual property - including the CMF vehicle architecture - that is shared between Renault and Nissan, said Patrick Pelata, a veteran of the two automakers' alliance who was formerly Renault's chief operating officer.""They will need Nissan’s agreement for it to be used by Fiat Chrysler,” Pelata told BFM radio on Tuesday. “Nobody’s talking about that right now, but it’s an important subject.”Renault would not likely be interested in sharing Fiat Chrysler's body-on-frame platforms, which underpin the automaker's big pickups and SUVs in North America, Fiorani said.""But if Nissan is invited to join the merger, that could open up new possibilities,"" he said. ""Nissan could use Fiat Chrysler's full-size truck platform for its next-generation Titan and Armada, while Fiat Chrysler could use Nissan's mid-size truck platform for the next-generation Dakota and Durango.""Fiorani said it likely would take at least two years after a Renault-Fiat Chrysler merger is approved before the arrival of the first new vehicles built on shared architectures.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.39% and the Dow slumped 0.93%.“I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it,” Trump said Monday at a joint press conference in Tokyo alongside Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. “They would like to make a deal. We’re not ready to make a deal.”The latest update on trade comes in the wake of escalating U.S.-China tensions after Trump hiked tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.Beijing hit back by raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of American products.The increasing investor jitters over U.S.-China trade put U.S. Treasury yields on the back foot as they fell to their lowest level since September 2017, forcing banking stocks lower.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) closed lower, keeping the broader financials in the red.Falling energy stocks also contributed to the slump, despite a rise in oil prices on expectations for reduced domestic supplies after flooding dented crude flow distributions from the main U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Okla.In tech, chipmakers, which are particularly vulnerable to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, remained under pressure, though Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) proved an exception to the overall decline.AMD rallied 9.8% after announcing the launch of several 7nm products across all markets within the next six months.Rival chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell nearly 2.5% on the news, as Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsey said that with AMD set to launch 7nm Ryzen 3 PC and Rome server CPUs in mid-2019, Intel will ""no longer be able to rely on its n-node silicon advantage, and will instead lean on its incumbency and breadth of silicon as its 10nm chips are not expected out until late 2019 in PCs and 2020 in servers.""In other company news, Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) accelerated 7% after proposing a merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA) in a bid to form the world's third-largest automaker. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) both fell.In economic news, U.S. consumer confidence overshot economists' expectations, rising to a six-month high on the back of ongoing strength in the labor market.Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:Advanced Micro Devices, Total System Services (NYSE:TSS) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) and Perrigo Company (NYSE:PRGO) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

Patrick Pelata, a former Renault chief operating officer, also criticized the deal plan for undervaluing Renault and threatening to overstretch its engineering resources.By valuing Renault at its market price, the all-share offer attributes a negative 6 billion euro value to Renault operations after deduction of its 43.4% stake in Nissan and 3.1% Daimler holding, Pelata told BFM radio.""That's hardly reasonable,"" he said. ""And I think that shareholders, including the French state, are bound to take issue with this sooner or later.""Pelata added: ""FCA has big problem because they haven't invested for the future - they have no electric vehicle platform and they've done nothing in autonomous cars.""French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told RTL radio on Tuesday that the plan was a good opportunity for both Renault and the European car industry, which has been struggling for years with overcapacity and subdued demand.(global sales by brand 2018: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WaZc1h) CONDITIONSLe Maire also said the French government would seek four guarantees in exchange for backing a deal that would reduce its 15% stake in Renault to 7.5% of the combined entity.""The first: industrial jobs and industrial sites. I told the Renault chairman very clearly that it was the first of the guarantees I wanted from him in the opening of these negotiations. A guarantee on the preservation of industrial jobs and sites in France,"" Le Maire said.The minister added that France wants to be well represented on the board of the new company, for it to be a leader in developing electric batteries and for the deal to take place ""within the framework of the alliance between Renault and Nissan"".A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that Renault and FCA had given commitments about maintaining industrial jobs and sites, leaving room for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as some plant downsizing.Also on Monday, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said Rome might need to take a stake in the combined company, balancing France's shareholding.Le Maire said he had spoken to the Japanese about the proposed tie up. Asked how they had responded, he replied: ""I look at the reaction of Nissan president Mr Saikawa, and it's a reaction that is open.""Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa is likely to have first caught wind of the merger plan through his own chief operating officer, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, who also serves on Renault's board, a source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Analysts have said that Nissan, which has a 15% non-voting stake in Renault, might be reluctant to back an FCA-Renault tie-up that would probably use its technology less than the current Renault-Nissan alliance. Saikawa told Japanese TV on Tuesday that Nissan is ""open to constructive discussions"".The Renault-Nissan alliance has been under strain since the arrest and ousting of former chairman Carlos Ghosn late last year on charges of financial misconduct, with Nissan recently rebuffing a merger proposal from its partner. Renault shares were up 1% by 1450 GMT, extending gains after Monday's 12% advance.

86,"May 28, 2019 10:15AM ET","Blindsided by FCA-Renault talks, Nissan risks being left by the roadside",nan,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Norihiko ShirouzuTOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan found out about Renault's merger talks with Fiat Chrysler just days before they became public, four sources told Reuters, stoking fears at the Japanese carmaker that a deal could further weaken its position in a 20-year alliance with  Renault  (PA:RENA).Nissan Motor Co Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa likely first caught wind of the merger plan through his own chief operating officer, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, who also serves on Renault's board, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard arrived in Japan on Tuesday to discuss the proposed tie-up - and presumably to try to smooth over ties.But the deal poses an additional challenge for Saikawa, already grappling with poor financial performance and an uneasy relationship with Renault after Nissan led the ousting last year of long-standing alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn. ""All this put Saikawa under massive pressure,"" a second source said, referring to the fact that negotiations caught the CEO and senior management off guard.Renault, which owns a 43.4% stake in Nissan, had previously angled for a merger with Nissan, but Saikawa has long opposed a full integration. [nL5N22Q90O]New vehicle and powertrain platforms developed by FCA-Renault could also pose a dilemma to Nissan, challenging its jealously guarded independence in some areas of engineering, research and development.    Nissan could find itself forced to choose between technology developed elsewhere or going it alone - between scale without autonomy and autonomy without scale, a source close to the Renault board said.FCA has said a deal would embrace Nissan and another alliance member, Mitsubishi Motors, as ""valued and respected partners"".""I have huge respect for Nissan and Mitsubishi, and their products and businesses,"" FCA Chairman John Elkann told the Nikkei. Still, there is awareness of friction between Renault and Nissan, which is perhaps why the Japanese company was not involved in talks at an earlier stage. ""The relationship between Renault and its Japanese partners is not as constructive as probably anybody wishes,"" said a source familiar with the FCA-Renault talks. ""The FCA view is that Nissan has a lot on its plate ... So the time is not right to consider anything other than enhanced cooperation.""'A STRONG SIGNAL'The French government, which owns shares in Renault, said on Tuesday it wanted Nissan to be on board with the deal.But there have long been tensions between Paris and Tokyo over the imbalance of power in the carmaking alliance, with Nissan holding only a 15% non-voting stake in Renault. The Japanese automaker's clear advantage is in its technology, including vehicles that meet China's tougher emissions regulations. Renault and FCA, therefore, would need Nissan to help them meet increasingly tough fuel economy, emissions and electric vehicle (EV) quotas around the world.An FCA-Renault tie-up would also raise questions about how to extract synergies in some markets where Nissan and FCA compete, such as in North American trucks and SUVs. The Japanese firm's line-up of Nissan and Infiniti brand SUVs competes with FCA's Jeep models such as the Cherokee. Nissan's Titan pickup is also competitor, albeit a weak one, to FCA's Ram pickup line.The fact Renault is prepared to consider creating such challenges may be a sign of its frustration with Nissan's reluctance over a full merger.""It sends a strong signal that Renault does not necessarily have to tie its fate to Nissan,"" said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA, about the proposed FCA-Renault tie-up. Saikawa told reporters on Tuesday that ""strengthening the alliance and constructive discussions are forward looking, and we are open to constructive discussions,"" according to Japanese broadcasters.But unless Nissan can regain the initiative, it risks being marginalized even more. ""If the Renault-Fiat merger happens and the status quo continues at Nissan-Renault, Nissan's position and influence within the alliance will fall behind Fiat,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama.Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said there were theoretically stronger synergies for Renault with FCA than with Nissan, and a better cultural fit too. ""It may be inevitable that Renault eventually exits Nissan,"" he said, adding the French company's stake in its Japanese partner was currently worth about 11 billion euros - ""plenty of capital to spend on EVs and new technology.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Wall Street set to open mixedStock markets are set to reopen flat after the Memorial Day weekend, after President Donald Trump’s visit to Japan failed to provide any real clarity about what will come next in the U.S.’s trade dispute with China.At 05:30 AM ET, the S&P 500 futures contract was down 3.6 points or 0.1%, the Dow futures contract was down 7 points, less than 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 1.5 points, also effectively flat.2. Bond yields hit 18-month lowThe demand for safe-haven assets continues to grow. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds hit 2.27% overnight, their lowest since October 2017, while the two-year yield, which is more closely tied to the Federal Reserve’s official interest rates, fell to 2.13%, equalling a 15-month low that it hit last week.The trade dispute with China has encouraged investors to bet on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates to support the economy. That thesis will be tested later in the day by the latest data on national house prices at 9 AM ET (1300 GMT), and by the release of the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT).3. Fiat Chrysler wants to merge with  Renault  The global automotive industry could be on the verge of a major shake-up. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) has proposed merging with France’s Renault (PA:RENA), and the French group has said it will “study with interest the opportunity.”On their own, the two companies would make the world’s third-largest auto group. But if Renault’s current strategic partners, Nissan (T:7201) and Mitsubishi (T:8058) joined the party, the new group would become the world's top group by sales, ahead of  Toyota   (NYSE:TM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).Both FCA and Renault rose over 10% on Monday, but have fallen back a little in early trading on Tuesday due to profit-taking.4. EU horse-trading gets seriousThe horse-trading to decide on who will rule Europe for the next few years gets started in earnest later today, as EU heads of government meet to start discussions on appointing the next European Commission.Elections to the European parliament at the weekend strengthened the hands of the Greens and liberal centrists backed by French President Emmanuel Macron. That makes it harder for Germany to advance Angel Merkel’s preferred candidate, the conservative Manfred Weber, to the top of the powerful bureaucracy.Other candidates to succeed Juncker include Michel Barnier, the Frenchman who led the EU’s negotiations with the EU over Brexit, and the current Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has fined the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) heavily in recent years for antitrust abuses.5. Echoes of a trade warThe U.S.-China trade war enjoyed something of a lull over the weekend, as official pronouncements on the subject dried up. However, the issue continues to play out in indirect ways. Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) is planning to raise up to $20 billion later this year with a secondary listing in Hong Kong, according to various reports citing people familiar with its thinking. The move would ensure the company still has access to international investors even if the trade war affects its New York listing.Elsewhere, the strains in China’s financial system started to show after Chinese authorities seized control of a bank for the first time in more than 20 years on Friday, citing “serious” credit losses.The yuan, meanwhile, weakened 0.3% to 6.9290 to the U.S. dollar in the offshore market."

The latest plot driver: the lender’s stock regularly hitting new lows.It was always clear that Christian Sewing would have much less time than his predecessors to get the bank’s problems fixed and tell the tale of a finally successful turnaround.With the stock dive and with many issues like interest rates and the state of the European economy out of his control, his options are becoming limited.It’s no surprise that during last week’s annual shareholder meeting he had to announce deeper cuts into the bank’s investment banking. While details about the next steps are not yet known, the history of investment banking restructurings shows that it often comes along with some sort of bad bank to wind down risk-weighted assets.And it looks like Deutsche Bank is mulling an overhaul and may face the unfavorable option of yet another capital raise to handle this.Meanwhile, management has to focus on the things it can control, mainly costs. Various problems arise on that front: first, cost-cutting campaigns are usually not sexy enough to lure new shareholders, it usually takes time to see the benefits of the cuts, and there is no guarantee of success as it almost always comes with further market share erosion, which can trigger more cuts, and so on.It also might lead to an exodus of talented people, and some cracks are already showing up with key figures mulling plans to leave the lender.It’s true, Deutsche Bank shares are cheap compared to its European peers, but the stock price needs more than pure valuation. It needs a good story to make people comfortable to invest in future returns.Bankhaus Metzler analyst Jochen Schmitt wrote in a recent note following a meeting with Sewing that the first major cost savings were likely to kick in next year and that the bank’s ability to at least halt or reverse the revenue decline and regain earnings power is “still a key risk.” That means the stock might remain a joyless investment in the short term.Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading 0.3% higher ahead of the open, while FTSE 100 futures are up 0.5% as U.K. markets return from a public holiday.SECTORS IN FOCUS TODAY:COMMENT:COMPANY NEWS AND M&A:NOTES FROM THE SELL SIDE:TECHNICAL OUTLOOK for Stoxx 600 index:TECHNICAL OUTLOOK for Euro Stoxx 50 index:MAIN RESEARCH AND RATING CHANGES:UPGRADES:DOWNGRADES:INITIATIONS:MARKETS:MAIN MACRO DATA (all times CET):"

95,"May 27, 2019 01:05PM ET",Elkann enlists Renault to drive Fiat family fortunes,nan,"By Giulio PiovaccariMILAN (Reuters) - When John Elkann lost his ally last year with the sudden death of Sergio Marchionne, some questioned whether the softly-spoken scion of the Agnelli clan would be able to emerge from his shadow to ensure Fiat Chrysler's future.But New York-born Elkann, who became Fiat chairman in 2010, acted decisively to fill the vacuum left by the larger-than-life Marchionne and get closer to the big merger deal the legendary executive was unable to deliver.At just 28 Elkann was thrust into the role of Fiat vice-chairman after the deaths of his grandfather and great-uncle ""because there was really nobody else"" to take the wheel.For Elkann, who got his first taste of the car industry as an intern at a factory producing headlights in Birmingham, England, the first 18 months with responsibility for the family-owned carmaker and its long heritage were ""terrible"".But from that low point, Elkann, 43, is now trying to merge Fiat Chrysler (FCA) with French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) to form the world's third largest carmaker and tackle new challenges facing the industry.Elkann will become chairman of the merged FCA-Renault if the deal goes ahead, ensuring the Agnelli dynasty plays a central role in the next chapter of automotive history.At an event in Milan on Monday, the usually-shy Elkann looked happy and confident. His first big break came with an instrumental role in persuading Marchionne, who was running one of the businesses owned by the Agnelli family, to become chief executive in 2004 and give Fiat ""a new start"", Elkann said in a ""Masters of Scale"" podcast last year.Fiat was at the time almost on the brink of collapse.This involved a ""very long night ... and many grappas"" but proved to be a turning point in the fortunes of the Italian company founded by Elkann's great-great-grandfather Giovanni Agnelli, which built its first car in 1899.In 2005, Elkann backed Marchionne in negotiating the breakup of an alliance Fiat had entered into with General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2000, receiving $2 billion from GM in return for cancelling a deal that could have required GM to buy the remainder of Fiat Auto. Marchionne then used GM's money to fund a turnaround at Fiat, which involved taking the Italian carmaker into a transformation alliance and then full-blown merger with U.S. automaker Chrysler as Elkann agreed to the Agnellis loosening their grip.If Elkann can deliver a deal with Renault - which will net the Agnellis about 725 million euros ($811 million) in a dividend payout - it will be partly thanks to his pick of new CEO.Michael Manley was probably was not the obvious choice, but the transition to the post-Marchionne era has been smooth with no tensions or rivalries within the family or the FCA group.The focus has been very much on the future as FCA, like its rivals, grapples with the challenges posed for the car making industry by fast-changing technology and regulation.NOTHING 'IMPOSSIBLE'Elkann, who is also Chairman and CEO of the Agnelli holding company EXOR, appears to be taking a leaf out of his great-great-grandfather's book.""We must always look to the future. Foresee the future of new inventions. Be unafraid of the new. Delete from our vocabulary the word 'impossible',"" Elkann quotes the Fiat founder's mantra as being.Elkann, whose French is better than his Italian, spent seven years at a lycee in France before studying Engineering at Politecnico, the Engineering University of Turin. He has often been portrayed more as a financier who has moved key elements of Fiat away from Italy.His efforts to keep Fiat on the road, however, have not been rewarded with the popularity his grandfather, known as ""L'Avvocato"", enjoyed even though he has maintained the family's involvement with soccer club Juventus and chairs the Giovanni Agnelli Foundation.Elkann has transformed EXOR's portfolio during his time in the driving seat of the family empire. He diversified into insurance - winning a bitter $6.9 billion takeover battle for Bermuda reinsurer PartnerRe in 2015 - and into media assets through The Economist magazine. Elkann, an admirer of Warren Buffett, also listed Juventus on the stock exchange, turning a hobby of Elkann's grandfather into a serious business.During his watch, Fiat has also spun off Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and truckmaker CHNI, in line with his philosophy that companies need to adapt to survive in the long-run. EXOR is still the top shareholder in both companies.After all these changes, Elkann is now at the top of a family empire less exposed to the cyclical and rapidly-changing auto industry yet with a potentially key role, with a stake of just below 15 percent, in a leading global carmaker.This will mean Elkann has delivered on his promise of upholding the Agnelli family's pledge to the auto industry, which still employs thousands of workers in Italy, while at the same time bringing taking FCA onto a new stage.And if he can keep to FCA's pledge not to shut plants, Elkann might yet become an Italian legend like his forebears.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

97,"May 27, 2019 10:49AM ET",Fiat Chrysler and Renault pursue $35 billion merger to combat car industry upheaval,nan,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Laurence FrostMILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler pitched a finely balanced merger of equals to  Renault  (PA:RENA) on Monday to tackle the costs of far-reaching technological and regulatory changes by creating the world's third-biggest automaker.If it goes ahead, the $35 billion-plus tie-up would alter the landscape for rivals including General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Peugeot maker PSA Group, which recently held inconclusive talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), and could spur more deals. Renault said it was studying the proposal from Italian-American FCA with interest, and considered it friendly. Shares in both companies jumped more than 10 percent as investors welcomed the prospect of an enlarged business capable of producing more than 8.7 million vehicles a year and aiming for 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in annual savings.It would rank third in the global auto industry behind Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). But analysts also warned of big complications, including Renault's existing alliance with Nissan, the French state's role as Renault's largest shareholder and potential opposition from politicians and workers to any cutbacks. ""The market will be careful with these synergy numbers as much has been promised before and there isn’t a single merger of equals that has ever succeeded in autos,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.With these sensitivities in mind, FCA proposed an all-share merger under a listed Dutch holding company. After a 2.5 billion euro dividend for existing FCA shareholders - giving a big upfront boost to the Agnelli family that controls 29% of FCA - investors in each firm would hold half of the new entity.The merged group would be chaired by Agnelli family scion John Elkann, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters, while Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard would likely become CEO.Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the proposed merger could be good news for Italy if it helped FCA to grow, but it was crucial to preserve jobs.He did not comment on the French government's 15% stake in Renault, but an influential lawmaker from the ruling League party said Rome may seek a stake in the combined group to balance France's holding.A deal could also have profound repercussions for Renault's 20-year-old alliance with Nissan, already weakened by the crisis surrounding the arrest and ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn late last year. The Japanese carmaker has yet to comment on FCA's proposal. In a letter to employees seen by Reuters, FCA chief executive Mike Manley cautioned a merger with Renault could take more than a year to finalize. 'BOLD DECISIONS'A deal could help both companies address some of the shortcomings that have led their market valuations to lag major rivals, as well as the shift to electric and self-driving technologies amid tightening emissions regulations. FCA has a highly profitable businesses in North America with its RAM trucks and Jeep brand, but lost money last quarter in Europe, where most of its plants are running below 50% capacity and it faces a struggle with new emissions curbs.Renault, by contrast, was an early mover in electric cars, has relatively fuel-efficient engine technologies and a strong presence in emerging markets, but no U.S. business.A deal would do little, however, to address both firms' limited presence in China, the world's biggest auto market.It would also create the challenge of managing a large number of brands, from high-end Maseratis to budget Dacias.The huge cost of countering disruptive new entrants such as Tesla's electric cars or future autonomous vehicles from Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has pushed other automakers to collaborate, including Volkswagen and Ford. FCA-Renault, like almost every possible automotive pairing, has been studied intermittently for years by dealmakers. But the fractious relations between Ghosn and FCA's long-standing boss Sergio Marchionne made constructive talks impossible before Marchionne's sudden death last July, banking sources said.Renault shares were up 15% to 57.46 euros at 1320 GMT, while FCA's Milan-listed stock was up 11.3% at 12.75 euros. PSA, widely seen as an industry consolidator, was off 3%.PARIS AND ROMEThe French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, supports a merger with FCA in principle but will need to see more details, its main spokeswoman said.France will be ""particularly vigilant regarding employment and industrial footprint,"" another Paris official said, adding any deal must safeguard Renault's alliance with Nissan, which recently rebuffed a merger proposal from its partner. Seeking to soothe concerns, FCA said the deal plans ""are not predicated on plant closures, but would be achieved through more capital-efficient investment"".The carmakers have given commitments to maintain industrial jobs and sites, one source said - leaving room for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as some plant downsizing. Early areas for potential convergence include Renault's next electric car platform being launched at its Douai site in France, the source said, adding all of Renault's board members backed the decision to study FCA's proposal with the exception of the leftist CGT union, which abstained. In a sign of potential future tensions, the CGT demanded the French state retained a blocking stake in any merged group. Appealing to Nissan, which is 43.4%-owned by Renault, FCA said the Japanese carmaker would nominate a director to the 11-member board of the new company. Nissan and affiliate Mitsubishi would also benefit from 1 billion euros in cost and investment savings, it added.Decision-making by such a board is unlikely to be straightforward, some analysts warned.""We now have the French, the Italians, the Japanese and the Americans needing to find consensus on the board of a Dutch company, where the French state stands to lose its special status,"" Ellinghorst said.""This requires quite a bit of creativity.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was ahead by 0.1%.The pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.4% with all major European indices in the black, although trading volumes were thin with markets in the United States and United Kingdom closed for market holidays.Auto stocks climbed 1.8% as Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler confirmed it had made a ""transformative merger"" proposal to French peer Renault in a deal which would create the world's third-biggest carmaker. Shares of both companies rallied.Markets were also buoyed as pro-European parties retained a firm grip on the EU parliament, provisional results from the bloc's elections showed, though eurosceptic opponents saw strong gains.Investors had been worried about eurosceptic parties gaining a 30% vote share - the level at which they could seriously disrupt European governance and the region's ability to show unity in addressing key concerns like a global trade war.But while far-right, nationalist or anti-EU groups came out on top in Italy, Britain, France and Poland, they failed to alter dramatically the balance of pro-European power in the EU assembly.""The impression of a fragmented political system remains, but perhaps when all is said and done, the message will be that Brexit has reduced appetite to leave the EU,"" said Kit Juckes, FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).The euro initially rallied above $1.12 but by 0920 GMT the single currency was struggling, down 0.1% at $1.1195.The dollar index gained 0.1% in quiet trading.""In the simple world of FX a possible crisis is averted, leaving us with familiar issues. Europe needs more growth and while EU leaders argue over who gets which top jobs, it needs easier fiscal policy perhaps most of all,"" Juckes said.European government bond markets were little moved with the spread between the German 10-year bond yield, considered one of the world's safest assets, and the Italian 10-year government bond yield little moved after initially narrowing.Spanish and Portuguese bond yields hit record lows - a sign of investor confidence after the election results.Elsewhere, U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Japan was overshadowed by trade tensions. Trump pressed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to even out a trade imbalance with the United States.Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have rattled investors in recent weeks, pressuring stocks lower just as concerns build about weakening momentum in the world's largest economies.The yen, often the currency of choice for nervous investors, fell 0.2% against the dollar to 109.495 but remained close to four-month highs hit earlier in May as traders looked for safety in the face of mounting trade-related woes. China's yuan rose to a 1-1/2 week high against the U.S. dollar on Monday, buoyed by a senior official's warning not to bet against the Chinese currency.The pound held around $1.2703. Sterling had bounced back from a near five-month trough of $1.2605 after British Prime Minister Theresa May last week named a date for her to step down - triggering a leadership contest during which investors fear the risk of a no-deal Brexit will rise. Oil prices mostly fell, extending losses from last week when crude dropped the most this year. Concerns the Sino-U.S. trade war could trigger a broad economic slowdown have sent this year's oil rally into reverse, although OPEC's supply cuts provided some support. Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.1% to $68.80 per barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.5% to $58.33 per barrel.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The League, after all, campaigned for Sunday’s European Parliament election on an “Italy First” platform.“Given the state presence in Renault, the fact that two companies of this size plan to merge has to be looked at with special care,” the League’s Claudio Borghi, who heads the lower house budget committee, told La7 television. Borghi was quick to remind viewers that the French government fought tooth-and-nail against a bid by Italy’s Fincantieri for the France-based STX shipyard.Italy will ensure “that the historic value of Fiat is guaranteed, otherwise we’ll intervene,” Borghi said, adding that could include the state taking a stake in Fiat to match the French holding in Renault.Debt MountainA French government official said it would be surprising if the founding Agnelli family welcomed a state presence in the company. The official, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters, also wondered aloud whether the Italian government -- already burdened with a mountain of debt -- would have the funds to pay for it.Still, the official could not see any political risks to the merger, and insisted it would be a win-win for the two countries and their economies.The merger will promote European “economic sovereignty,” French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told BFM TV, adding the government favors the link-up, though it’s waiting to examine all the conditions.With the League surging to become Italy’s biggest political force in Sunday’s European elections, Salvini could be more tempted than ever to fly the nationalist flag and take a provocative stand on the merger, especially if jobs are at risk.“We welcome the FCA-Renault deal, as long as factories in Italy stay open,” the League’s Massimo Garavaglia, deputy finance minister, told Radio 24. “The market is always right.”Recent cross-border transactions have inflamed nationalism in both countries.  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA’s two biggest shareholders, French media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA and U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp., have been locked in a battle for influence at the carrier for more than a year.Salvini has taken particular pleasure in launching folksy broadsides against Macron, last year calling him “a polite young man who drinks too much champagne.” Salvini has also accused Macron of protecting fugitives wanted by Italian authorities, including convicted members of the far-left Red Brigades.Macron, who has spoken of “populist leprosy,” retorted that Italians “deserve a government worthy of their history.”The sparring between the two neighbors has quieted down from its low point, when France recalled its ambassador for a week in February, although Salvini repeatedly took aim at Macron in the European election campaign, calling the French leader a symbol of the liberal, establishment class he pledged to overthrow."
100,"May 27, 2019 05:24AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,nan,"Investing.com -- These are the top 5 things to know about in the market on Monday, May 27. The New York and London stock exchanges are both closed today for public holidays.1. Europe's populist push fizzlesMainstream political parties held the line in elections for the European Union parliament, as right-wing populists failed to make significant gains on their showing from five years ago, although traditional center-left and center-right parties leaked support to the Greens and other centrist blocs.Results from the U.K. showed more voters defected to pro-Remain parties from the Conservatives and Labour than to pro-Brexit parties. The Brexit party of Nigel Farage emerged as the party with the most seats.In Italy, speculation on new elections rose after the right-wing populist Lega gained at the expense of its partner in the government, the Five Stars Movement. The yield spread between Italian and German 10-year government bonds - a barometer of political risk in Italy - rose by a modest 2 basis points to 269 basis points. The euro was little changed at $1.1197.2. Trump says not pursuing regime change in IranCrude oil prices fell to a two-month low after President Donald Trump said he's not looking for regime change in Iran. The comments eased some of the concerns about geopolitical risk, one of the few factors supporting crude prices as the worsening trade war between the U.S. and China takes its toll on the global economy.International Brent blend futures were at $67.48 as of 5:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), having fallen from over $69.20 overnight. U.S. crude futures were down 0.4% at $58.41.Figures released on Friday showed that financial market players had cut their bets on crude for a fourth week in a row.The fall in prices led U.S. oil companies to cut the number of drilling rigs in use to their lowest level since March last year.3. Fiat Chrysler proposes Renault mergerFiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) proposed a 50:50 merger of equals with French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), a deal that would create the world's third-biggest automotive group behind Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).The U.S.-Italian group's offer includes a special dividend of 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) to 'equalize' the value of the companies.The move comes weeks after Renault's long-standing strategic partner Nissan rejected fresh overtures for a full merger. Relations between Renault and Nissan have soured as a result of the fraud charges brought in Japan against Renault's former CEO Carlos Ghosn.Read more: StockBeat: The Spirit of Sergio Marchionne Lives on in FCA-Renault Merger Plan4. China sounds the alarm over the yuanGuo Shuqing China’s top banking regulator Guo Shuqing warned speculators against short-selling the yuan in a speech on Saturday, saying they would ""inevitably suffer a huge loss.""The yuan opened stronger against the dollar on Monday after the comments, but lost most of its gains after data showing that Chinese industrial profits posted their steepest drop in nearly three-and-a-half years in April. Profits fell by 3.7% year-on-year. The dollar closed at 6.8911 yuan in Asian trading.Weakening profitability at China's companies has been one of the main reasons why analysts fear that Beijing could be forced to let the yuan depreciate to absorb the shock of U.S. tariffs. Guo's comments suggest Beijing is as worried as anyone else by that scenario.5. Bitcoin rallyPrices for Bitcoin surged nearly 10% to their highest in over a year, although reasons for the move were as hard as ever to fathom.The digital currency hit an intra-day high of $8,953.80, before retracing slightly.The move occurred overnight during Asian trading, with most of it happening within a half-hour window."
101,"May 27, 2019 05:00AM ET",Italy's League says it will stick with coalition after Europe vote win,nan,"By Gavin JonesROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's far-right League said on Monday he would stick with his coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star party, despite his own victory and 5-Star's disappointing third place finish in a European election.After speculation in the runup to the vote that a thumping League win could shift the balance of power and undermine the year-old coalition, League leader Matteo Salvini struck a magnanimous tone in victory.""For me our government allies are friends and from tomorrow we will get back to work with serenity and softer tones,"" Salvini told reporters.""My opponent is and remains the Left,"" he said, referring to the pro-Europe Democratic Party (PD), which placed second.For his part, 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio blamed his party's defeat on a low turnout in its southern strongholds, and also ruled out a cabinet re-shuffle.""Nothing will change and we will get going again from today,"" he said in an interview with daily Corriere della Sera. He said he hoped to meet Salvini this week to set the next priorities and he expected they would govern together for a full five-year term.With the vote count almost completed, the League had more than 34% of the vote and 5-Star had just 17%, an almost exact inversion of the result of national elections a year ago that led to the coalition between the two. The PD was on around 23%.The campaign was acrimonious, with the League and 5-Star fiercely attacking each other, increasing the speculation that the coalition might be in jeopardy after the vote.Despite Salvini's magnanimous comments, other figures in his party suggested the balance of power had shifted towards Salvini, who is pushing for deep tax cuts in possible defiance of EU budget rules.""Deciding the priorities of the government will now be up to Matteo Salvini and the League,"" said the League's parliamentary leader, Riccardo Molinari.Italian government bond yields showed little reaction to the election. The closely-watched spread over German Bunds hovered around 269 basis points early on Monday, virtually unchanged from the end of last week, while Italian shares were buoyed by a proposed merger between Fiat-Chrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA).The big gap between the two parties' support may encourage internal 5-Star dissent towards Di Maio, who is likely to face pressure not to make any major concessions to Salvini which might further erode grass-root support.""In the short term it's not in either side's interests to break up the government, and they will try to find stability,"" said Alessandra Lanza, from the Bologna-based economic consultancy Prometeia.However, analysts said that with the economy almost stagnant, the government will face a tough task in the autumn putting together a 2020 budget which keeps the League's promises of tax cuts while keeping public accounts under control.""We face a difficult economic situation, I am well aware of that,"" a buoyant Salvini said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the early hours of Monday, after his election victory was confirmed.(Additional reporting Valentina Consiglio)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

102,"May 27, 2019 04:39AM ET",StockBeat: The Spirit of Marchionne Lives on in FCA-Renault Deal,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Sergio Marchionne may be gone, but his spirit lives on.The former Fiat boss would surely have applauded his successor’s plan for another transformative merger to address the problems of slowing demand and frighteningly large investment obligations as mobility becomes electric, autonomous and connected.FCA's (NYSE:FCAU) strongest card is the extra efficiency such scale creates: it estimates annual synergies at over 5 billion euros, in addition to those that  Renault  (PA:RENA) currently enjoys with its merger partner Nissan (T:7201). A combined FCA-Renault would be the world’s third-largest automotive group behind Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). But – more importantly – it could also convince Nissan and Mitsubishi (T:8058) that there is no long-term alternative to deeper integration with Renault. That could enhance the efficiencies of scale still further.But as with so many of Marchionne’s grand designs, Fiat Chrysler’s move on Renault risks being bogged down by the details – and by the sheer number of moving parts in the deal.First, there is the promise of no plant closures. This comes after a six-month period in which – according to Bloomberg calculations – global carmakers have announced 38,000 job cuts. Of those, only 1,500 have come from FCA and none from Renault. The two companies are behind in the race to trim costs and this promise reduces their ability to extract the maximum benefit from the deal (although it’s conspicuous that there’s no promise about the safety of white-collar jobs)Second, there's the ownership question: the Financial Times has cited an unnamed French government official as saying the government isn’t opposed to the deal, but the French state’s stake would be diluted in a merged company, and it would only be the second largest shareholder behind Exor, the Agnelli family holding company now run by Johann Elkann. FCA has tried to address concerns of control by proposing an 11-member board with four members each from FCA and Renault, with one more from Nissan.Either way, markets have decided they like the idea, and have pushed Renault 13.7% higher on Monday morning, while FCA is up 9.9%.  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), which could see its competitive position jeopardized, is down 2.6%. That’s helping the Italy lead Europe’s stock markets higher on a morning where the mood has been lifted by the reasonably strong showing of centrist parties in elections to the European parliament.The FTSE MIB is up 0.9%, while the French CAC 40 is up 0.3%. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600, which includes a lot of U.K. stocks that aren’t trading today due to the local bank holiday, is up 0.4% at 377.32 as of 4.30 AM ET (0830 GMT)."
103,"May 26, 2019 03:06PM ET",Carmakers FCA and Renault to go public on tie-up talks,nan,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Laurence FrostMILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are set to confirm tie-up talks on Monday, with the board of the French carmaker called to an early morning meeting to discuss the situation.It comes after news broke over the weekend that two of the world's leading car companies are in talks on a comprehensive global combination that could address some of the main weaknesses of both.The plan under discussion would involve some transfer of equity, according to a source close to the discussions. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the two companies are considering a merger of equals, among other tie-up options. Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard presented an FCA-Renault merger plan to French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Friday, Les Echos reported on its website. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault. The deal being discussed would include guarantees covering corporate governance and employment in France and Italy, the French daily said.Pressure for consolidation among carmakers has grown with the challenges posed by electrification, tightening emissions regulations and expensive new technologies being developed for connected and autonomous vehicles.Earlier this year FCA Chairman John Elkann - a member of Italy's Agnelli dynasty that controls the company - stressed the family's commitment to the automotive industry. But he also added that they were prepared to take ""bold and creative decisions"" to help build a solid and attractive future for the company.A source said earlier an announcement from Italo-American FCA could provide some concrete although initial details but added the situation was still ""fluid"".A separate source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that the Renault board will meet on Monday morning at 0800 local time (0600 GMT) to discuss the issue.REGIONAL RATIONALEFCA has a highly profitable North American RAM trucks business and Jeep brand but has been losing money in Europe, where it may also struggle to keep pace with looming carbon dioxide emissions curbs.Renault, by contrast, is an electric-car pioneer with relatively fuel-efficient engine technologies and a strong presence in emerging markets, but no U.S. business.Any tie-up would likely face political and workforce hurdles, particularly in Italy. However, most of FCA's European plants are running below 50% capacity.A deal between FCA and Renault would not preclude a consolidation of Renault's alliance with Japanese carmaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd , a source told Reuters on Saturday. The Renault-Nissan partnership, underpinned by cross shareholdings, has been strained by the scandal surrounding former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was ousted after his arrest last year.Speculation about the future of Fiat Chrysler, often seen as a potential M&A target, intensified after the sudden death of long-serving former CEO Sergio Marchionne almost one year ago. In October last year, just after three months he was picked to replace Marchionne, new CEO Mike Manley agreed to sell FCA's car parts unit Magneti Marelli to Japan's Calsonic Kasnsei, owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc .The sale was completed early this month for 5.8 billion euros.According to reports earlier this year, the manufacturer had also restarted talks with France's PSA Group - which have been a recurrent theme over the years.Fiat Chrysler and Renault together would have a combined market capitalization of more than 32 billion euros ($36 billion) and total global sales of 8.7 million vehicles.Fiat Chrysler has a valuation of just under 18 billion euros and Renault around 14.4 billion An alliance that included Nissan would vault the ensemble to the rank of global No.1 carmaker with 13.8 million annual sales. It would also maintain a foothold in China, where both FCA and Renault are marginal players.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

What it meant was we consciously decided to focus on performance to the detriment of reliability,"" he explained.""It means that a number of engines that should have been used on the dyne to secure reliability were actually used to develop performance.""So what it meant was a very good start in terms of engine power, but reliability that was below standard,"" he said.The problems have had a big impact on track, with Renault eighth out of 10 teams while new signing Ricciardo, last year's winner for Red Bull in Monaco, has finished only once in the points.On the chassis side, Abiteboul said Renault were still playing catch-up.""We’ve grown up massively in Enstone (the factory), moving from 450 to 750 (people), but frankly our practices, our organization, our processes are the same today as they were when we were 400, or even as we were maybe back in 2005,"" he said.Organizational changes have been made and the team have targeted next month's French Grand Prix at Le Castellet for signs of clear progress.""We are committed by Paul Ricard to have all the problems and all the delays that have been hurting us at the start of the season sorted out,"" said Abiteboul.""Our collective response to the situation is to come up with sufficient lap time improvement to put us clear of the midfield, which was our target for the season.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

106,"May 23, 2019 02:27PM ET",Hamilton fastest for mourning Mercedes in Monaco,nan,"By Alan BaldwinMONACO (Reuters) - Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton was fastest for mourning Mercedes in both Monaco Grand Prix practice sessions on Thursday.The Briton, excused media duties following the death of Mercedes' non-executive chairman and triple world champion Niki Lauda, lapped the treacherous street circuit with a quickest time of one minute 11.118 seconds in the afternoon on soft tyres.The five-times world champion, seven points clear of team mate Valtteri Bottas at the top of the standings after five races, had set the pace on a dry morning with a time of 1:12.106.Red Bull's Max Verstappen was second fastest in the first session, just 0.059 slower than Hamilton, but sat out much of the afternoon with a suspected water leak.Bottas ended the day in second place and 0.081 off the pace in a familiar Mercedes one-two.""It's the dream for every driver to come to Monaco and have a car that you can exploit and utilize your abilities with,"" Hamilton said in a team review of the day. ""We've made some small tweaks over the two sessions and during the sessions as well, but I've been quite happy with the set-up."" Between them, Hamilton and Bottas have won every race this year with five successive one-twos -- the best ever start to a season -- and are favorites for a sixth on Sunday.Charles Leclerc, hoping to become the first Monegasque to stand on his home podium since Louis Chiron in 1950, was fourth fastest for Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in the first session with four-times champion team mate Sebastian Vettel fifth.HAMILTON'S PACEVettel moved up to third in the later session, 0.763 off Hamilton's pace, and just ahead of Red Bull's Pierre Gasly while Leclerc dropped to 10th. ""Talking about our performance, we are struggling a bit, we are lacking some pace compared to our main rivals,"" Vettel said.""We are still not happy with how the tyres work. I think we have a bit of work ahead of us."" Leclerc said he had felt comfortable in the morning but was held up by traffic later on.Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren all carried tributes to Lauda on their cars with Mercedes team members also wearing black armbands.Vettel wore a helmet modeled on one of Lauda's, with the Austrian's name on. Two of Lauda's three titles were won with the Italian team.Both sessions were free of crashes, although there were the inevitable near-misses on a tight and twisty circuit where cars skim the metal barriers and brush the unforgiving walls.Gasly had a close escape at the exit to the first swimming pool chicane early on while Robert Kubica spun his Williams (NYSE:WMB) at the exit to Casino Square (NYSE:SQ) but came to a halt without serious damage.McLaren had a difficult first session with Carlos Sainz failing to set a lap time and Lando Norris only 15th, but recovered to 13th and 12th later on.Last year's winner Daniel Ricciardo, who has since moved from Red Bull to  Renault  (PA:RENA), ended the day in 17th place and just behind German team mate Nico Hulkenberg.Williams were last and about four seconds off the pace.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But given Nissan's current focus on improving corporate governance and recovering from a run of poor results, Keiko Ihara, who has been overseeing efforts to overhaul governance, told Reuters in an interview that the issue of a merger was not on the table at the moment.""We don't have time to feel any of the pressure which appears to be coming externally,"" she said. ""We're not aware of any director nominee who wants to make this an official topic of discussion at the moment.""Ihara, who also chairs a provisional council for an external nominations committee to be set up next month, said the process to find eventual successors to CEO Hiroto Saikawa and other executives would begin soon after the group is formed.Saikawa, a protege of Ghosn, has come under pressure to lift Nissan's dismal operational performance just as Renault has been looking at ways to merge the two companies, a move opposed by Saikawa and some of his colleagues.Ihara also said that Nissan has a lot of internal talent from which it can choose its next generation of executives after an exodus of top-level officials following the ouster of Ghosn.Nissan is overhauling its board structure and the way it appoints top executives and determines their pay as it seeks to improve its corporate governance after it accused Ghosn of financial misconduct.Ghosn denies all charges against him.Last week, Nissan announced a list of 11 nominees for its expanded board of directors, which include Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard and CEO Thierry Bollore, to be voted on by shareholders next month.It also decided that Saikawa would stay on as chief executive though Renault had earlier pushed for a change in Nissan's leadership.""Once the nominations committee is up and running, it will start considering a succession plan,"" Ihara said. She said the provisional council believed there were ""dozens of people"" within the company who could eventually take over as CEO, chief operating officer or other management positions.""Nissan is a global company so it has a wealth of people who have deep global experience and expertise,"" Ihara said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

109,"May 22, 2019 10:23AM ET",Motor racing: Leclerc dream and Lauda memories stir Monaco emotions,nan,"By Alan BaldwinMONACO (Reuters) - Charles Leclerc will race around his home streets in a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) for the first time in Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, a boyhood dream come true, but dominant Mercedes also have sentiment on their side.The death on Monday night of Austrian Formula One great Niki Lauda, a triple world champion and non-executive director of the Mercedes team, has cast the showcase race into a different light.A week ago there were those who feared a sixth successive Mercedes one-two finish, at a tight and twisty track that has seen plenty of processions in the past, would have the fans turning off in droves.Now that looks more like a fitting tribute to a man who won his titles with McLaren and Ferrari but would have been cheering on the Silver Arrows of Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas as loudly as anyone.Various tributes are expected for one of the sport's greatest characters, who won for Ferrari in Monaco in 1975 and 1976.Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said his compatriot had been a guiding light.""As a team-mate over the past six and a half years, Niki was always brutally honest -- and utterly loyal,"" he said.""It was a privilege to count him among our team and moving to witness just how much it meant to him to be part of the team's success."" Hamilton leads Bottas by seven points going into one of the Briton's favorite races, and one he has won twice already, and the characteristics of the car suggest Mercedes will again be frontrunners.""If you look at their performance in the low-speed section of this (Barcelona) circuit, you would expect them to be very strong (in Monaco),"" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said after Hamilton won in Spain 10 days ago.""They’ll certainly be very much the favorites.""VERSTAPPEN HOPERed Bull won last year from pole position with Daniel Ricciardo, but the Australian has moved to  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Max Verstappen is the main hope now.The young Dutchman does not have such happy memories of the track, wrecking his chances last year by hitting the wall in Saturday's final practice and lining up last.""Looking at the low-speed performance in the last sector (in Spain), we are clearly not the favorite and I also don’t expect it to be like last year when we were super strong in Monaco,"" he said.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel is a two-times Monaco winner but much of the attention will be on Leclerc, who was born in the principality and can become the first local driver to score points at home since Louis Chiron in the 1950s.A first career F1 win for the Monegasque, who crashed out last year on his debut with Sauber, would be truly momentous.""It’s my first home GP as a Ferrari driver and it’s bound to be a special weekend,"" he said.""I remember as a kid, I would spend the afternoon with a friend who lived in a flat with a balcony overlooking the Ste. Devote corner. We used to play with toy cars while the real ones rushed past beneath us. ""I always told myself that one day, it would be great to be driving in this race.""Ricciardo, who has finished only once in the points this year with a best result of seventh, is unlikely to be standing on top of the podium on Sunday but the Australian does expect a better showing.""I’ve done it before so it’s familiar territory.

111,"May 17, 2019 06:22AM ET","Nissan retains Saikawa as CEO, in likely rebuff of Renault",nan,"By Maki Shiraki and Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Friday that Hiroto Saikawa would stay on as chief executive, backing the protege of former boss Carlos Ghosn even as top shareholder  Renault  had earlier pushed for a change in the Japanese automaker's leadership.Saikawa's re-appointment is likely to be seen as a rebuff to Renault SA (PA:RENA), which has pushed for leadership changes as a prelude to merger talks, sources at both companies have told Reuters. Saikawa - who has long opposed full integration - is seen as an obstacle to a tie-up, several people have said.Nissan has proposed that Renault Chief Executive Thierry Bollore will join the board, while Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard will remain on it. The board will be increased to 11 members from eight, and will include seven outside directors. The proposals will be put to a shareholder vote in June.The make-up of Nissan's board has vast implications for the Nissan-Renault alliance. The unequal relationship between them - smaller Renault has the bigger stake in Nissan - has long been a source of friction.The board unanimously backed Saikawa, even while acknowledging he may have not done enough to rein in Ghosn, one external director said. Ghosn, who has been charged with financial misconduct, has denied wrongdoing.""While there are issues pertaining to Saikawa's responsibility, we feel it is more constructive to focus on cooperation within the alliance, Nissan's recovery and its strategic plan,"" Keiko Ihara said.""We had a robust debate, we took our time to look at the risks ... but in the end all of the directors agreed to the appointment,"" she said, adding that Renault's Senard had agreed at a meeting earlier this week to the decision to keep Saikawa. However, a source close to Senard said there had been no vote earlier this week, unanimous or otherwise, on Saikawa's reappointment as CEO.LACKLUSTRE PERFORMANCENissan's uninspiring performance in the months since the dramatic ouster of Ghosn in November has sparked concern at the French automaker.Renault owns 43% of its bigger partner and analysts estimate that Nissan's planned 30% dividend cut this year will wipe around 130 million euros ($145 million) from the French company's earnings.The two Renault executives were recommended to Nissan's board by the French automaker to strengthen the alliance, Ihara said. Renault also recommended Bernard Delmas, who chairs French tyre company Michelin's Japanese operations.There had been widespread speculation about Saikawa's future and the make-up of the board after Nissan this week flagged a 28% drop in annual profit and slashed its dividend, underscoring its struggle to turn a page after Ghosn.Ghosn's arrest in Japan and immediate ouster by Nissan strained the partnership, as Renault resisted a full investigation of alliance finances and kept its absent leader in office as chairman and CEO for two more months.Ghosn is out on bail and awaiting trial in Tokyo.Nissan's shares ended down 0.9 percent on Friday, underperforming a 0.9 percent rise in the Nikkei share average.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

118,"May 14, 2019 07:37AM ET","Nissan set for weakest profit in 11 years as Ghosn woes, bleak sales weigh",nan,"By Naomi TajitsuYOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co forecast a 28% plunge in its annual operating profit, putting it on course for the weakest earnings in 11 years and underscoring its struggle to turn the page after former Chairman Carlos Ghosn was ousted.The lackluster outlook from Japan's No.2 automaker - hit by Ghosn's arrest last year and troubles at its North American business - is likely to add to the pressure on CEO Hiroto Saikawa as he tries to overhaul corporate governance and put Nissan on a more equal footing with alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA). Nissan's weakening profit and a growing number of departing executives and managers have raised concerns at Renault, which holds a 43% stake in the Japanese firm and has pushed for closer ties. These issues could strengthen the argument for closer links between the two automakers, although some Nissan executives have opposed a full merger and what they see as an unequal partnership that gives smaller Renault more sway over Nissan.""Today we have hit rock bottom,"" Saikawa told a news conference at the company's headquarters in Yokohama on Tuesday, adding that he wanted the company to recover to its original performance level in next two to three years.""Most of the problems we are facing are the negative legacy of our old leader,"" he said in a reference to Ghosn, adding that the company had been slow to move on from these problems.Nissan expects operating profit of 230 billion yen ($2 billion) for the year to March 2020, missing the 457.7 billion yen average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.The automaker reported an operating profit of 318 billion yen in the year just ended, down 45% from a year earlier. It also booked 4.4 billion yen in expenses to reflect previous misstatements involving Ghosn's compensation.Sluggish profitability would likely result in a 30% cut to full-year dividend to 40 yen per share, Nissan said. DIFFERENT VIEWSAfter Ghosn's ousting as head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, the French automaker is set to discuss forming a joint holding company to give both companies equal footing, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Saikawa declined to comment on the progress of the discussions, but acknowledged a difference of opinion with Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard regarding a closer capital integration between the two companies.""I have been negative to the idea of a full merger,"" he said. ""Now is not the right time to discuss a merger. We have to focus on our recovery,"" he said.Ghosn, out on bail and awaiting trial in Japan, has been charged on several counts of financial misconduct and of allegedly enriching himself at Nissan's expense. He has denied all charges and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup.The scandal has rocked the global auto industry and raised concerns about Nissan's ability to regain its footing following the departure of the charismatic leader and the architect of its alliance with Renault.Widely considered a protege of Ghosn before taking the reins at Nissan, Saikawa has now come under fire for not doing enough to limit Ghosn's broad control over the company, and for the drop in the automaker's performance since he took over in 2017.Saikawa has said that he planned to eventually hand over to a successor, but on Tuesday he gave no indication of when such a move may come.""Timing is a matter I need to decide,"" he said, adding that he would step down ""at the appropriate time"".U.S. BLUESThe biggest blow to Nissan's bottom line has come from the costly sales incentives in the United States, where its sales fell 9.3% to 1.44 million units in the year ended March 31.For years it has relied on heavy discounting in its biggest market to sell its Rogue compact SUVs and Altima sedans, under aggressive targets Ghosn set during his time as CEO.Saikawa has pledged to focus on improving U.S. profit margins, but it has been a slow process as Nissan continues to resort to discounting.The automaker also cut its mid-term revenue target to 14.5 trillion yen by 2022, from 16.5 trillion yen. It sees its annual operating margin at 6% by then, versus an earlier target for 8%. Nissan shares are down around 2% this year, after losing a fifth of their value last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Will Europe be next?Autos aren’t the only sector faring badly after early trade Monday in Europe, but they’re clearly in the firing line after the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to use tariffs so forcefully over the weekend. A decision on whether to impose tariffs on European autos is due on Saturday and the signs aren’t good, with the U.S. administration's action against China over the weekend showing no sign of accepting conventional wisdom that tariffs choke growth and leave consumers worse off.“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.All of Europe’s big carmakers are down over 1% this morning, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down 2.8%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) down 1.4%,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) down 1.7%, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) down 1.2% and BMW (DE:BMWG) down 1.1%.  Renault  (PA:RENA) is faring slightly better, down only 0.5% as a result of separate news of it making a formal merger proposal to Nissan (T:7201).The escalation of the trade war is hitting markets generally, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.7% at 374.86 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.1%, Germany’s Dax is down 0.9% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.The extent of the threat is best seen, however, in its impact throughout the supply chain.

The delay is not expected to derail the Commission's proposal, with only Spain and Finland expressing concerns. Internet connected cars are expected to generate billions of euros in revenue for carmakers, telecoms operators and equipment makers once the market takes off.Last month EU lawmakers gave the thumbs up to a wifi-based standard, which primarily connects cars to other cars. Supporters include  Renault  (PA:RENA), Toyota, NXP, Autotalks and Kapsch TrafficCom. Daimler, Ford, PSA Group, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Huawei, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Samsung (KS:005930) are lobbying for the 5G standard which hooks up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, and has a bigger range of applications.Mobile telecoms operators lobbying group GSMA said there were a number of disputed points in the Commission's proposal.""We expect the Council legal service (CLS) to be critical about this piece of legislation as it lays down a de facto mandate for wifi whereas the Commission should remain technology neutral,"" Joop Hazenberg, GSMA's director, said. ""There are also other strong doubts of the CLS on the Delegated Act, such as the Commission giving itself powers it does not have.""The Commission's proposal can only be overturned with a blocking majority of EU countries.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

124,"May 09, 2019 06:40AM ET",Mitsubishi Motors switches gears to slower growth in post-Ghosn era,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp forecast on Thursday a 19 percent fall in operating profit this year as it reins in aggressive growth amid slowing global car demand and charts a new course after the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn. Japan's sixth-largest automaker, in which Nissan Motor Co holds a controlling stake, expects profit to fall to 90.0 billion yen ($821.02 million) in the year to March, after a 14 percent rise to 111.8 billion yen in the year just ended.Mitsubishi said the need to invest heavily to develop and market new, on-demand transportation services and lower-emissions vehicles to comply with tighter regulations would put pressure on the automaker's growth prospects in the coming years. It expects global sales to rise 4.9 percent to 1.31 million vehicles in the current year, slowing from the 13 percent growth seen in the year ended March as it sees sales growth slowing in Southeast Asia, a key market which has more than doubled in the past decade. Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko said that the automaker would accept slower sales growth by easing the pace of expansion in ASEAN countries and growth markets of China and the United States in the coming years to ensure sustained profitability. ""We need to drastically revise our strategy even if we experience a temporary stall in performance,"" Masuko told reporters at a briefing.""It's not realistic to adopt a strategy based only on expansion. We need to prioritize healthy growth.""Masuko said that he would resist relying on discounting and fleet sales to grow overall sales, a strategy which has stung partner Nissan in the United States. Mitsubishi is contending with slowing demand for cars, ongoing global trade frictions and the need to develop new technologies just as it and its partners Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) grapple with the fallout from the arrest of Ghosn, the group's former chairman who is facing charges of financial misconduct in Japan.Ghosn has been accused of enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan. Since his initial arrest in November, he has also been charged with temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books and understating his salary during his time at the helm of Japan's No. 2 automaker.He has denied all charges against him.Masuko said he was unaware of plans by Renault to propose the creation of a joint holding company that would give the French automaker and Nissan equal footing, as media had reported late last month.    He added that the three companies had not discussed management integration, an idea which Nissan has long opposed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Stock funds for the region lost $1.9 billion in the period and have now had 56 weeks of outflows out of the past 58. The Stoxx 600 is still bumping along recent highs despite a relatively good earnings season.About a quarter of companies in the Stoxx 600 have reported figures so far and we’ve seen growth in both sales and profits, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC). If the numbers continue to look good this week, it may help reverse the massive outflows.Strategists at Barclays point out that earnings, which had been expected to contract in the first quarter, are off to a good start, while fears over margin pressure haven’t materialized.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists share the optimism and see the resilience of topline growth in both the U.S. and in Europe as encouraging. This could prove to be helpful for continued earnings delivery in the second half of the year and beyond, they write.Separately, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch strategists highlighted in their earning tracker that European stocks are having their best quarter in seven, with a 52 percent beat on earnings per share. And it might not be over. Their quantitative models suggests that the worst period of low profit growth is now behind us. The  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Earnings Revision Index seems to show a similar trend.Drilling down, the best-performing sectors regarding earnings so far in the season have been: banks, food, health care and technology, according to BofAML. Retail and personal goods are at the bottom, taking into account industries where at least five companies have already reported. Consumer-related sectors are the only ones where less than half of stocks have surpassed EPS estimates.Finally, 73 percent of value stocks have beaten forecasts so far, BofAML said. Could this be the good news investors were waiting for to begin some rotation? The next few weeks will tell.

Unaware that the Russian had also failed to negotiate turn three and had stopped right behind, Ricciardo put the undamaged  Renault  (PA:RENA) into reverse and crunched straight into the side of his rival's car.Both drivers subsequently retired and stewards blamed Ricciardo, handing him the grid drop as well as two penalty points -- his first in the 12 month period.The Australian apologized to Kvyat, a former Red Bull team mate, and accepted full responsibility.""I obviously don't feel good about what just happened,"" he said. ""As soon as I went down the escape road I guess it was just a sense of urgency and a bit of panic, if you will.

127,"Apr 26, 2019 07:48AM ET",Renault to propose joint holding company with Nissan: Nikkei,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) will propose to Nissan Motor Co a plan to create a joint holding company which would give both firms equal footing as the French automaker seeks further integration with its Japanese partner, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.Under the proposal, both firms would nominate a nearly equal number of directors to the new company in which ordinary shares in both Nissan and Renault would be transferred on a balanced basis, the newspaper said, without citing sources. This would effectively dilute the stake held by the French government in Renault to around 7-8 percent, from its current 15 percent, it added. The new company would be headquartered in a third country, such as Singapore.Renault plans to make the proposal to Nissan soon, the Nikkei said, having modified an earlier merger idea which Nissan rejected on April 12.Nissan declined to comment on the issue. The Financial Times newspaper reported that both Nissan and the Japanese government have refused to engage in merger talks with Renault. The report of the proposal comes as the outlook for the alliance - one of the world's top automaking partnerships - has clouded since the arrest in November of its main architect, Carlos Ghosn, for suspected financial misconduct.It also comes as Nissan's financial performance struggles following years of focusing on volume sales over building its brand, particularly in the United States, its biggest market. FORECAST SLASHEDThis week, the Japanese automaker slashed its profit forecast for the year just ended to its lowest in nearly a decade, citing weakness in its U.S. operations.Renault for years has been vying for a closer merger with Nissan, which it rescued from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago. Ghosn had been working to achieve a deeper integration before his arrest on financial misconduct charges in November last year. While the automakers have been consolidating many of their operations over the past decade, including procurement and production, many executives at Nissan have opposed an all-out merger with Renault.Instead, Nissan has argued for a more equal footing with Renault, which holds a 43 percent stake in its bigger partner. Nissan holds a 15 percent stake in Renault.It was unclear whether Renault would hold the casting vote in major decisions at the new company, as it did in Renault-Nissan B.V., a strategic management company jointly held by both companies which oversaw operations for the partnership. That company was disbanded last month after an internal investigation by Nissan following Ghosn's arrest indicated that the company may have been involved with financial misconduct by the former chairman.Nissan's partnership with Mitsubishi Motors Corp, in which it holds a 34 percent stake, would remain unchanged under the new proposal, the Nikkei said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Banks-heavy Italian and Spanish indices were laggards.The banking index fell for a fourth day, at the end of a heavy earnings week for lenders. Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) tumbled after posting lower first quarter profit, hurt by intensifying competition and Brexit uncertainty, while its investment bank also registered poor returns.Weakness in investment banking also dented Deutsche Bank's quarterly trading revenue and sent its shares lower a day after the German bank abandoned merger talks with smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).""The current interest rate environment makes it challenging for banks to make proper earnings because of their intermediary function,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist eurozone, at Rabobank.Since the start of April, all country indexes were on pace to rise between 1.8 percent and 3.4 percent, their fourth month of gains, while Germany was strongly outperforming with 6 percent growth.""For now the current sentiment is very cautious as markets wait for the first estimates of the U.S. GDP growth which could see a surprise,"" Mevissen said.U.S. economic data for the first-quarter is due at 1230 GMT. Growth worries outside the United States resurfaced this week after South Korea's economy unexpectedly contracted at the start of the year and weak German business sentiment data for April also disappointed.Among the biggest drags on the benchmark index in Europe were the basic resources sector and the oil and gas sector, weighed down by Britain's Glencore and France's Total, respectively.Glencore dropped after reports that U.S authorities were investigating whether the company and its subsidiaries violated certain provisions of the commodity exchange act.Energy major Total said its net profit for the first three months of the year fell compared with a year ago due to volatile oil prices and debt costs.Chip stocks in the region including Siltronic, Ams and STMicroelectronics lost more than 1 percent after  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) reduced its full-year revenue forecast, adding to concerns that an industry-wide slowdown could persist until the end of 2019.Meanwhile, healthcare, which is also seen as a defensive sector, was a bright spot. It was helped by French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) after it returned to growth with higher profits and revenues for the first-quarter.Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES led media stocks higher after it maintained its full-year outlook on the back of the company's Networks division.Automakers in the region rose 0.4 percent, led by Valeo's 6 percent jump as the French parts maker said its performance would improve in the second half of the year.

Earnings before interest and tax slid 16% although, at 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion), they still beat consensus forecasts by nearly 10%.Even though outgoing Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche reaffirmed the company’s full-year outlook, the company’s shares were still down 0.3% on the news. That was lagging the local Dax index, which was broadly unchanged.The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was also flat, losing 0.12 points – less than 0.1% to 390.02. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.Daimler is facing a steep rise in investment obligations as it migrates to electric vehicles, along with its German peers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG). The three are all facing the prospect of fines from the European Commission for colluding to keep sub-optimal diesel engines on the road when they had better technology available to deploy.Renault has problems of a slightly different nature, most obviously in the enormous distraction created by the criminal charges against its long-time CEO Carlos Ghosn. The Wall Street Journal is reporting Friday that the French company is preparing to propose a merger with Nissan, its Japanese partner, hoping to restore a relationship that has been badly strained by the Ghosn affair.Renault's greater exposure to emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina has hurt it in recent months, and like its European rivals it has had to abandon hopes of making money in Iran in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to tighten sanctions on the country.Renault’s sales were down 5.6%, although it eked out a 2% gain in Europe, its most important market. As a result, its shares outperformed the local CAC 40 index, rising 1.7%.Europe’s other carmakers such as Volvo (OTC:VLVLY) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) have also reported weak first quarters."

The Tokyo District Court said in a statement that it had approved a bail request from Ghosn's defense team and set bail at 500 million yen ($4.5 million), roughly half his previous bail of 1 billion yen.The once-feted executive will be free to leave the detention center where he has been in custody since his April 4 re-arrest, but his movements and communications will be strictly monitored and restricted to prevent fleeing the country and tampering with evidence, the court said. Ghosn's lawyers filed the bail request on Monday after the former executive was indicted for allegedly enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan from July 2017 through July 2018.The court's decision marks the second time Ghosn has made bail and is the latest turn in a scandal which has rocked the global auto industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).He was initially released last month, but then re-arrested earlier this month on the new charges, returning to the Tokyo detention center where he had previously spent 108 days following his first arrest in November.Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of ""backstabbing"", describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese automaker and Renault, its top shareholder.When he was last released, the former executive traded in his usual tailored suit and chauffeured sedan for a disguise of workman's uniform, glasses and a mask to slip past reporters before being whisked away in a modest compact van.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Falling profit has been a headache for Nissan since before Ghosn was first arrested in November on allegations of financial misconduct. Currently in jail after his fourth arrest, Ghosn, who denies wrongdoing, could learn as early as Wednesday whether he will be released on bail for a second time.The once-feted executive has repeatedly accused Nissan executives of mismanagement since his ouster, which he has characterized as a boardroom coup. Now the automaker is saying that Ghosn's arrest has hurt business. ""Everyday, there are many reports of the case,"" Nissan CFO Hiroshi Karube said on Wednesday, referring to the scandal.""Non-Nissan users are hesitant to buy our cars."" U.S. WOESThe biggest blow, however, to Nissan's bottom line has come from the costly sales incentives in the United States. For years it has relied on heavy discounting in its biggest market to sell its Rogue compact sport utility vehicles and Altima sedans to expand market share, under aggressive targets Ghosn set during his time as chief executive.Saikawa, who took over as CEO in 2017, has pledged to focus on improving profit margins, but it has been a slow process as Nissan continues to resort to discounting to shore up sales. ""Sales volumes were lower than expected, so we were unable to realize our cost-reduction plans,"" CFO Karube said, adding that overall dismal U.S. performance will wipe 43 billion yen from Nissan's bottom line in the year ended March.""We didn't make as much progress on volumes and improvements to incentives as planned,"" he added.Analysts warned that Nissan's troubles could weaken its footing with partner Renault, which has been pushing for a closer merger, but which many at Nissan have opposed. ""To maintain its stance against closer ties with Renault, Nissan must improve its financial performance so it can hold its position,"" said Satoru Takada, managing director at securities research company TIW.

135,"Apr 24, 2019 01:28AM ET","Hyundai Motor profit jumps as South Korea, U.S. sales offset China slump",nan,"By Hyunjoo JinSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor reported a better-than-expected 24 percent jump in net profit for the January-to-March quarter, as improved business at home and the United States helped offset weaker sales in China.The rise in profit, from an eight-year low hit a year ago, comes after Hyundai recently flagged plans to suspend production at its oldest plant in China as it grapples with massive overcapacity in its biggest market.Hyundai posted a first-quarter net profit of 829 billion won ($721.81 million), versus 668 billion won a year earlier. This was above an average estimate of 758 billion profit from 15 analysts, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv data. Its operating profit rose 21 percent to 825 billion won, while its revenue was up 7 percent to 23.99 trillion won. Its first-quarter sales in China slumped 19 percent to its lowest since the global economic downturn in 2009, dragged by the lack of attractive models and strong branding amid growing competition from local and global rivals. An overall slowdown in auto sales in China in the first quarter after contracting in 2018 for the first time in almost three decades weighed further on Hyundai's sales in the country, home to the world's biggest car market.In contrast, Hyundai's sales in South Korea rose 9 percent to its highest since 2002 in the first quarter, with its new Palisade large SUV selling better than expected, even as its rivals from General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to Mercedes Benz and BMW struggled with falling sales. U.S. SALESIn the United States, the world's second-largest car market where Hyundai is slowly catching up with the shift to sport utility vehicles, the automaker's sales rose 2 percent.Just last week, Hyundai hired former Nissan executive Jose Munoz to oversee its Americas operation, replacing William Lee, who has held the position for less than a year. The appointment comes at a time when Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors, together the world's the fifth-biggest automaker, are facing regulatory investigations in the United States into the timeliness of recalls involving defective engines and thousands of fires connected to their vehicles.A threat of import tariffs has further blurred the outlook for their U.S. sales. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to levy tariffs of some 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts on national security grounds, has until about May 17 to act on any tariff recommendations made by the Commerce Department. South Korean government officials said the country could be exempt from the tariffs as Seoul has made concessions in autos under a revised trade deal with Washington. But Hyundai CEO Ha Eon-tae cautioned union leaders earlier this month that tariffs, if imposed, could wipe off two of the automaker's South Korean factories, according to a union newsletter on its website.Hyundai has one factory in the United States and around half of its vehicles sold in the United States comes mainly from South Korea and Mexico. Hyundai shares rose 1.5 percent after the results, outperforming the wider market's 1.3 percent fall.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

136,"Apr 23, 2019 08:25AM ET",Nissan says senior executive Schillaci to leave amid reshuffle,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co on Tuesday said the executive responsible for its Nissan, Datsun and Infiniti brands was leaving, as it announced a management reshuffle to strengthen governance following the ouster of former boss Carlos Ghosn.Nissan said Daniele Schillaci, an executive vice- president who had been responsible for the three brands and for all operations in the Japan, Asia and Oceania regions, had chosen to leave the company to pursue an opportunity closer to his native home in Europe.Nissan also said it had named executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi as chief operating officer to strengthen daily operations. It appointed an executive dedicated to performance recovery efforts and added executives overseeing major markets such as Japan, North America and China to the its executive committee.Such changes, it said, were based on recommendations from an outside governance panel that it received last month. The external committee last month concluded a three-month audit of Nissan's governance and put blame squarely on what it called Ghosn's concentration of power.Ghosn, who has been arrested on charges of financial misconduct, has denied all the allegations against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup by those who opposed his drive for a closer alliance with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).A representative for Ghosn has previously said the committee's findings were ""part of an unsubstantiated smear campaign against Carlos Ghosn to prevent the integration of the alliance and conceal Nissan's deteriorating performance"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3 percent by 0930 GMT after seven straight sessions of gains, with all major indices in the red except oil major-heavy London's FTSE 100 which rose 0.4 percent. Earnings started to roll in on a not-so-positive note with Umicore tumbling 16 percent, after the Belgian group warned revenue and earnings growth in 2020 will be lower than previous indications due to delays in the electric vehicle and energy storage markets.Umicore's slide weighed heavily on Belgium's blue chip Bel 20 Index, pulling it 1.5 percent lower.Car part suppliers Plastic Omnium and Faurecia also reported first quarter results. Plastic Omnium slid after warning of a decline in worldwide auto production, but Faurecia rose 1.5 percent after the company met its full-year target. Belgium's Melexis, which supplies semiconductor solutions for cars, slipped 6 percent after first quarter net income tumbled. ""We're pausing for breadth ahead of a fairly busy week of earnings after a decent winning streak,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group in London.The banking index eased from six-month highs with major European banks as UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) slated to report earnings late this week after last week's mixed bag of results from big Wall Street banks. ""We've seen the likes of record profits from J.P. Morgan but nothing close in Europe. The numbers aren't going to be great,"" said Lawler. Earnings numbers from some of the biggest S&P 500 companies, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), are also due this week. Payments company Wirecard was among the biggest decliners after Germany's markets regulator Bafin's two-month ban on short-selling ended on Friday. Ahold Delhaize slid after the Dutch supermarket warned that a strike at its Stop & Shop chain in U.S. would hurt its underlying 2019 profit margin, as it missed out on around $200 million on Easter week sales. Renault  (PA:RENA) fell 1.4 percent after Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it would reject a management integration proposal from its French partner and called for an equal capital relationship, according to a Nikkei report.Also weighing on sentiment was Beijing's indication to tone down its stimulus measures following unexpected signs of recovery from first-quarter economic data last week. CRUDE LIFT The oil and gas sector was among the lone bright spots with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), British Petroleum and Total, up between 1.7 percent and 2 percent. Oil prices were at 2019 highs on Tuesday after Washington announced all Iran sanction waivers would end by May, pressuring importers, mostly Asian, to stop buying from Tehran.Surging oil prices, however, took a toll on airline stocks. Air France, EasyJet plc, Lufthansa and Ryanair , all shed between 2 percent and 4 percent.Getinge was the top performer on the STOXX 600 after the Swedish medical technology company beat first quarter sales estimates and said restructuring measures will boost profit in the second half of the year. Thomas Cook jumped 14 percent after a Sky News report that the world's oldest tour operator was tentatively approached by several parties regarding a takeover of its tour operating division or the entire company.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

138,"Apr 22, 2019 03:56PM ET",Nissan to reject new integration proposal from Renault: Nikkei,nan,"By Maki ShirakiTOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd will reject a management integration proposal from French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and will call for an equal capital relationship, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday, citing sources.Nissan's management feels the Japanese company has not been treated as an equal of Renault under existing capital ties, and a merger would make this inequality permanent, the Nikkei said https://s.nikkei.com/2veityL.The outlook for the alliance - one of the world's top automaking partnerships - has been in focus since the arrest in November of its main architect, Carlos Ghosn, for financial misconduct. The former Nissan and Renault chairman has denied the charges against him and has said he was the victim of a boardroom coup by Nissan executives opposed to closer ties.Renault saved Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago and under their current capital alliance, the French company holds greater control over its much larger partner.Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa declined to say whether the company had received such a proposal from Renault. ""Now is not the time to think of such things,"" he told a group of reporters outside of his house in Tokyo. ""At the moment we are focused on improving Nissan's earnings performance. Please give us time to do that.""Renault declined to comment on the report. Renault has argued in its proposal that an integration would maximise synergies within the French-Japanese alliance, according to the Nikkei.The Financial Times reported last month of Renault's intention to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months.The two companies said in March they would put themselves on more equal footing, breaking up the all-powerful chairmanship previously wielded by Ghosn.The alliance between Renault and Nissan was first set up in 1999 and was expanded in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors.Separately, Japanese prosecutors indicted Ghosn on Monday on another charge of aggravated breach of trust, the fourth charge against him, which his lawyers met immediately with a bail request.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

139,"Apr 22, 2019 08:00AM ET",Ghosn lawyer requests bail after ex-Nissan chairman indicted for fourth time,nan,"By Tim Kelly and Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors indicted Carlos Ghosn on Monday on another charge of aggravated breach of trust, a Tokyo court said, the fourth charge against the former Nissan Motor Co Ltd chairman, which his lawyers met immediately with a bail request.The charge came on the day Ghosn's latest detention period was set to expire. Ghosn had been out on bail when authorities arrested him for a fourth time on April 4 on suspicion he enriched himself at a cost of $5 million to the automaker.""We are confident that we have the evidence to successfully prosecute all four cases,"" an official from the prosecutor's office said at a briefing after the indictment was announced.Ghosn has denied all four of the charges, which include understating his income, and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup. He has accused former colleagues of ""backstabbing"", describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between Nissan and its top shareholder, France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).""Carlos Ghosn is innocent of the latest charges brought against him by the Tokyo prosecutors, aided and abetted by certain Nissan conspirators,"" a Ghosn representative said in a statement.The case has exposed tensions in the Nissan-Renault alliance forged by Ghosn some two decades ago when the French automaker invested in Nissan, then on the brink of bankruptcy - a deal that gave Renault control over its larger partner.Nissan is due to reject a management integration proposal from Renault and will instead call for an equal capital relationship, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday, citing sources.Ghosn's arrest has also focused a harsh light on Japan's judicial system, which critics refer to as ""hostage justice"" as defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail.Under Japanese law, prosecutors are able to hold suspects for up to 22 days without charge and interrogate them without their lawyers present. In accordance with these terms, prosecutors had to indict or release Ghosn by Monday.CRIMINAL COMPLAINTAccording to the latest indictment, Ghosn caused a total of $5 million in losses to Nissan from July 2017 through July 2018.During that period, prosecutors allege two separate payments of $5 million were made from the account of a Nissan subsidiary into the account of an overseas dealership. A total of $5 million was subsequently transferred from the dealership's account to another account in which Ghosn had an interest. Nissan said it had filed a criminal complaint against the former chairman in relation to the matter, saying it had determined that some of its overseas payments had been ordered by Ghosn for his personal enrichment.The payments were ""not necessary from a business standpoint"", Nissan said in a statement. ""Such misconduct is completely unacceptable, and Nissan is requesting appropriately strict penalties.""A court would likely rule on the bail request on Tuesday, Ghosn's lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters.Before Ghosn's latest arrest, he had been out on $9 million bail for 30 days. He is now being held in the same Tokyo detention center where he was detained for 108 days following his initial arrest on the tarmac at a Tokyo airport in November.Kyodo news agency previously reported, without citing sources, that Nissan funds had been shifted through a car dealer in Oman to the account of a company Ghosn effectively owned.Sources have previously told Reuters that Renault had alerted French prosecutors after uncovering payments it deemed suspect to a partner in Oman.Evidence sent to French prosecutors showed much of the cash was channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by associates of Ghosn, who holds Lebanese citizenship, the sources told Reuters.Ghosn's French lawyer denied the allegations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Financial markets in Europe are to remain closed on Monday.Here’s what you need to know to start your week.1. U.S. GDPAn advance reading of U.S. economic growth in the first three months of 2019 is set to be released on Friday. Growth was 2.2% in the final quarter of 2018.Economists are more upbeat about the first quarter growth outlook after data last week showing that the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in February as Chinese imports plunged in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs.Another report showed that U.S. retail sales grew at their strongest pace in one-and-a-half years in March.One closely tracked gauge of quarterly GDP, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow forecast model, showed Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.8% annualized rate in the first quarter.A month ago, GDPNow estimated annualized growth of just 0.2%, which would have been the lowest since a one-off GDP contraction in the first 2014 quarter.2. Other economic reportsAhead of the GDP report, data on Thursday will look at durable goods orders for March, with the consensus forecast for a rebound of 0.7% after a 1.6% decline in February. Other U.S. data includes reports on homes sales on Monday and Tuesday and a look at consumer sentiment on Friday.Germany’s Ifo business confidence index, due on Wednesday, will be closely watched amid lingering concerns over the outlook for the euro area’s largest economy at a time when European Central Bank policymakers are debating whether stimulus measures are enough to spur inflation.3. Earnings kick into high gearU.S. first quarter earnings season ramps up after getting off to a mixed start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all reporting.Also on the docket are Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS),  Lockheed Martin  Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY),  United Tech  (NYSE:UTX), Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), AT&T (NYSE:T), Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa (NYSE:V), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX).In Europe, the auto sector will be in focus with a flurry of earnings due from  Michelin  (PA:MICP),  Continental  (LON:0LQ1), Daimler (LON:0NXX),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), and  Renault  (PA:RENA). These stocks are particularly sensitive to growth in China and will be watched as the stirrings of a recovery were felt in recent Chinese GDP data .4. Central banksCentral banks in Japan, Canada and Turkey are all to hold meetings this week.The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold at its meeting on Thursday and to forecast that it expects inflation to remain below its 2% target.The BOJ is facing a daunting task in its years-long efforts to help push up inflation toward its 2% goal, with a slowdown in global growth and trade making its task even more difficult.The Bank of Canada will meet on Wednesday, with no change in interest rates expected.Turkey’s central bank is to announce its latest rate decision on Thursday, and is also expected to keep rates on hold. The lira has recently come under pressure amid speculation that the central bank is borrowing to boost its foreign currency reserves.5. U.S.-Japan trade talksDonald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are due to meet in the White House on Friday for talks on U.S.-Japan trade and efforts to contain North Korea’s nuclear program.Last week U.S. and Japanese officials held a first round of talks toward a new trade deal Trump has sought and the U.S. side raised concerns over the “very large” trade deficit with Tokyo.Discussions on North Korea are likely to cover next steps after Trump’s failed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.-- Reuters contributed to this report"
141,"Apr 19, 2019 07:01AM ET",Nissan slams output cut report as 'completely incorrect',nan,"(Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Friday a report by the Nikkei that it would slash production this year was ""completely incorrect"" and that it had lodged a complaint with the business daily, in an unusually strong denial of a media report in Japan.The comment came after the Nikkei, revered in Japan for its business news and known for its market-moving scoops and previews, said Nissan would cut its global production by about 15 percent for the current fiscal year ending March 2020.The move would mark a shift away from the aggressive expansion campaign promoted by ousted former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the Nikkei said.""The details reported in this story are completely incorrect, and Nissan has voiced its strong objection to the Nikkei,"" the Japanese automaker said in a statement posted on its website.""Nissan's production plan for the current fiscal year will be disclosed on May 14, when the company announces its financial results for the previous fiscal year,"" said the maker of the Rogue sport-utility vehicle and Altima sedan.The Nikkei, which also owns Britain's Financial Times newspaper, confirmed it had received the complaint from Nissan. It said it would continue to cover the issue and promptly report all the facts once they become clear. The newspaper had earlier reported that Nissan aimed to produce about 4.6 million units in fiscal 2019, citing plans being communicated to the automaker's suppliers. The move was likely to impact earnings and could cast a pall over Nissan's alliance with French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), the Nikkei said without elaborating.That would be the steepest production cut in more than a decade by the Japanese automaker, as it battles weak sales in overseas markets including the United States where it plans to scale back sales operations, according to the Nikkei.Earlier this year, Nissan, which has been battling falling sales, lowered its operating profit forecast for the current fiscal year to 450 billion yen ($4 billion), 22 percent lower than a year earlier. It would be Nissan's lowest profit since 2013.Japanese companies typically respond to media reports by saying they were not the source of the information and, depending on the content of the report, that they may be considering various options and that nothing had been decided.It is rare for a Japanese firm to say it has issued a strong rebuke to a media outlet.Shares in Nissan, mired in a financial misconduct scandal involving Ghosn and the company itself, closed down 2.2 percent on Friday, versus a 0.5 percent rise in the broader market.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Ghosn, who had been released on $9 million bail in early March after spending 108 days in jail, has denied all allegations against him. His defense team has launched a public battle against the prosecutors, calling the latest arrest ""illegal"" in documents seen by Reuters.Once celebrated as the savior of a near-bankrupt Nissan 20 years ago, Ghosn has been ousted as chairman of Nissan,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp since his arrest, threatening the stability of the auto-making alliance he masterminded.

144,"Apr 18, 2019 12:30PM ET",Explainer: Betting on the past? Europe decides on connected car standards,nan,"By Douglas BusvineFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Commission's push to implement a Wi-Fi standard for connected cars has won the support of lawmakers in a victory for Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), although competitor BMW and other backers of a rival technology still hope to overturn the decision.Advocates of the alternative C-V2X standard - which stands for Cellular Vehicle to Everything - say their technology is already viable and will only improve as next-generation 5G mobile networks are rolled out.The apparently dry debate over acronyms has divided the car and telecoms industries and will influence which continent ends up dominating automated driving technologies that promise to be safer than people behind the wheel.There are around 25,000 annual road fatalities in the EU and another 135,000 serious injuries. The Commission wants to halve both by 2030 as part of a long-term 'Vision Zero' goal to virtually eliminate them by 2050.China, the world's biggest car market, is already pressing ahead with C-V2X, which is designed to work with 5G but is incompatible with Wi-Fi. Ford will deploy C-V2X there in 2021 and has committed to install it in all its new cars and trucks in the United States from 2022. The European Council, the intergovernmental part of the EU's decision-making process, is due to take a decision by mid-May.Here's an explainer of what's at stake and how the process is likely to play out:WHAT IS THE COMMISSION PROPOSING AND WHO BACKS IT?The European Commission has proposed a legal act to regulate so-called 'Cooperative-Intelligent Transport Systems' (C-ITS). This backs the ITS-G5 Wi-Fi standard that has already been adopted by much of the auto industry and is already certified.The most prominent supporter of ITS-G5 is Volkswagen, which says it will start fitting the Wi-Fi technology to vehicles this year. VW argues that viable C-V2X technology is years away, while Commission researchers could not find any commercially available C-V2X gear to test, according to a document seen by Reuters.Also backing ITS-G5 are  Renault  (PA:RENA), Toyota, VW truck units MAN and Scania, chip maker NXP, road-toll company Kapsch and technical standards umbrella group VdTueV.WHY DO OTHER AUTO MAKERS AND TELECOMS PREFER 5G?Supporters of C-V2X have grown rapidly in number since eight companies - Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) ERICb.ST>, Huawei, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) - founded an alliance in 2016.The group, the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), now counts more than 100 members who argue that C-V2X is better than Wi-Fi in terms of security, reliability, range and reaction time.5G advocates object to a review process foreseen by the Commission that would allow other technologies to be admitted later to C-ITS, once certified. They say such interoperability is impossible because Wi-Fi and cellular radio technologies are incompatible.""It's like putting a DVD into a VHS player and trying to make it work,"" Mats Granryd, head of the GSMA telecoms industry group, wrote in a letter to EU lawmakers this week.WHICH IS THE BETTER TECHNOLOGY?Participants in the debate agree that C-V2X running on 5G networks will be the better technology - even Volkswagen is a member of the 5GAA - but they differ on when it will be ready for prime time.C-V2X could, for example, help a connected car spot a person on foot carrying a smartphone before the driver does, making it possible for automated systems to hit the brakes and alert the pedestrian to the danger - a potential lifesaver.Wi-Fi is cheaper, because 5G operators would charge for data. On the other hand, regulated mobile networks would likely be safer, says independent technology analyst Richard Windsor: ""Would you trust your vehicle to be driven by a home router?"" he asked.Other markets led by China are meanwhile pressing ahead with C-V2X, potentially burdening European auto makers with the expense of developing and installing different systems in cars for the home market and for export.WHO'S LIKELY TO PREVAIL IN THE END?European lawmakers passed the Commission's legal act by a narrow majority on Wednesday and the matter now goes before the European Council.Here, opponents of the Commission's proposal would need the backing of a so-called qualified majority of the EU's 28 member states - 16 countries representing 65 percent of its population - to block it.That will be a tall order, but 5G backers are hoping that a skeptical opinion expressed by the Commission's own legal advisory team will bolster their case, say sources. A Council working party meets again on May 3 and May 10 to review that advice.The government of EU heavyweight Germany says it has taken note of those reservations and has yet to make up its mind. A decision in the Council is due by May 13, although the review period may be extended.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Daimler declined to comment on the cost savings figure and on Manager Magazin's report but has previously ruled out forced redundancies until the end of 2020.The magazine said the savings are being sought by Daimler's Ola Kaellenius, who will become Chief Executive in May.Daimler said in February it would pursue cost saving measures after fourth-quarter operating profit plunged 22 percent, hit by trade wars, rising costs for developing electric cars and an industry downturn.Manager Magazin said around 30,000 Mercedes-Benz cars with faulty vehicle electronics were produced at its plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, requiring expensive reworking which was causing production delays.Those delays had led to a revenue shortfall of around 2 billion euros and could depress first quarter earnings by up to half a billion euros, the report said. Daimler is due to release first quarter earnings on April 26. Manager Magazin also said Daimler plans to become a carbon neutral company by 2040, ensuring that all new cars, production methods and suppliers work in ways which do not produce carbon dioxide emissions.Separately, Kaellenius will not renew common projects with French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan, letting an alliance between the carmakers lapse, the magazine said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

146,"Apr 18, 2019 06:45AM ET",Take Five: Spring growth? World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/CENTRAL PLANNINGThe 100 years since the Fed's creation in 1913 is said to be the century of central banking. Well, since the 2008-2009 crisis, we've certainly lived through a decade of central banking. But with monetary policy taken to the limit to lift growth and inflation, can central banks do any more?Of late, some of the economic and business confidence data is giving rise to hopes rate-setters might just be able to hold fire on further action for now. German and Japanese PMIs ticked modestly higher from March, and from China to the United States, the hope is that spring will bring some green shoots on the economic front. Central banks in Japan, Canada and Sweden hold meetings in coming days so we may get some clues on what they are thinking.ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos and Olli Rehn, widely tipped to succeed ECB Governor Mario Draghi, will also be quizzed on the subject at upcoming speeches, especially since sources tell Reuters ""a significant minority"" of ECB rate-setters doubt any recovery is underway. Central bankers in Australia and New Zealand have sounded similarly gloomy. A decade of central banking and planning is not over yet2/GDP NOW!The working thesis through the early months of 2019 was that U.S. economic growth would continue to tail off as tailwinds faded from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut and headwinds picked up from a weaker global economy, partial federal government shutdown and trade wars. Indeed, that looked to be the case as most economic data through the first quarter fell short of forecasts. As a result,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s U.S. economic surprise index came to near the most negative in around two years.But one closely tracked gauge of quarterly gross domestic product, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow model, has rebounded sharply in recent weeks and may be signaling that the advance reading of first quarter GDP may not be quite so grim.A month ago, GDPNow estimated an annualized 0.2 percent growth, which would have been the lowest since a one-off GDP contraction in the first 2014 quarter. Now the model forecasts quarterly growth will come in at 2.4 percent. That would not only top current estimates of 1.8 percent but would mean growth actually accelerated from the fourth quarter's 2.2 percent.One factor behind the turnaround was a surprise narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit as Chinese imports plunged in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs. By some estimates, trade could now contribute as much as one percentage point to first quarter GDP after being a washout in the fourth quarter.3/CORNER KICKAs we said above, central banks don't have much ammunition left in their arsenal. The toolbox is probably lightest at the Bank of Japan.At the G20 meeting in Washington, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was ready to expand monetary stimulus if needed. But he also said he had no plans to change the central bank's forward guidance, or the message it sends to signal policy intentions to financial markets. To many, that sounded like a man backed into a corner.Kuroda has a chance to prove otherwise at the upcoming BOJ meeting. Expectations are thin though, given the BOJ's balance sheet is already bigger than the country's economy and Japanese financial institutions are suffering immense pain from the prolonged monetary easing.The world's No. 3 economy may have contracted in the first quarter, and whether it recovers depends much on first, whether China recovers too and second, on whether the trade conflict between the other two powers sharing the podium reaches a resolution.3/TAKING A DIP IN EUROPEThe United States is widely seen as heading into an earnings recession (defined as two straight quarters of negative year-on-year earnings growth) but Europe might, at least for now, escape one.European firms are expected to deliver their first quarter of negative earnings growth since 2016 - the latest I/B/E/S Refinitiv analysis predicts Q1 earnings to fall 3.4 percent year-on-year. But it expects results to pick up again in Q2.So despite this quarter's poor outcome, hopes for a bounce-back could keep equities buoyant. After all, sentiment is already rock bottom - investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) named ""short European equities"" the most crowded trade for the second month running.The auto sector will be in focus in coming days with a flurry of earnings from  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Continental, Daimler, Peugeot, and  Renault  (PA:RENA). These stocks are particularly sensitive to growth in China and will be watched as the stirrings of a recovery were felt in recent Chinese GDP data .5/ RUSSIAN ROULETTEThe past two years have seen an increasingly bitter rift open up between President Donald Trump's Republican supporters and his Democrat critics over the alleged collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign in the 2016 U.S. election.That may not be defused even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 400-page report on the subject is unveiled by Atttorney General William Barr. He has already told lawmakers the investigation ""did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""But that is unlikely to stop U.S. politicians from continuing their clamor for sanctions against Russia. As for investors, their appetite for Russian assets has not so far been dented. After plummeting last year, foreign buying of rouble-denominated government bonds has recovered sharply so it remains to be seen whether that bullishness continues.Meanwhile, Ukraine -- the reason behind the original 2014 sanctions on Russia -- looks set to elect comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy as president. Could the election of a new leader bring about some rapprochement between Kiev and Moscow? Watch this space."

The technology primarily connects cars to other cars.5G backers include big names like Daimler, Ford, PSA Group, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Huawei, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm and Samsung (KS:005930).Fifth generation, or 5G, standard hooks up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, with a wider range of applications in areas such as entertainment, traffic data and general navigation.The Commission has defended its stance on wifi technology, saying that it is available unlike 5G and that it would help to boost road safety.Critics have said a requirement that new technologies be modified to be compatible with older technology is unrealistic and would put a brake on innovation.""The text, as currently proposed by the Commission, fails to ensure a level playing field between existing technologies ... by imposing discriminatory interoperability and compatibility requirements against newer technologies,"" lobbying group and 5G technology supporter 5GAA said.The telecoms industry, which is putting its hopes in 5G applications to recoup its investments, was similarly critical.""Europe cannot mandate only one technology for connected driving. Member states can now correct this by bringing 4G and 5G back into the picture: global competitiveness and safety are at stake,"" said Lise Fuhr, director general of telecoms lobbying group ETNO. The last hurdle for the plan is the European Council where opponents would require a blocking majority to overturn the proposal. There are no details yet on when the Council will decide.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

TomTom in January agreed to sell its fleet management business to Japan's Bridgestone for 910 million euros, in order to concentrate on its digital map-linked businesses, which it has said it expects to grow by around 15 percent to 430 million euros in 2019.TomTom's prospects took a huge knock last year with the entry of Google's far-reaching supply deal with a group of carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and Mitsubishi . The Amsterdam-based company also faces a long-term decline in the sales of dashboard-mounted satnav devices.TomTom said the HD contracts were with two of the world's largest car companies but gave no further detail.""The key attraction of these wins is strategic,"" said ING analyst Marc Hesselink, who rates the stock a ""buy"". ""By adding clients to the HD platform, TomTom gets more data to improve and update"" it.Shares were up 3.8 percent to 8.47 euros by 1045 GMT, and are up around 7 percent year to date. First-quarter revenue reached 169.5 million euros ($192 million), above an average forecast of 157 million from analysts polled by the company.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 18.8 million euros also beat an average forecast of 12 million.TomTom stuck to its full-year outlook for revenue of 675 million euros, including 430 million from its location technology, and free cash flow of around 10 percent of revenue.TomTom also sells mapping services to software makers.

The European parliament will vote this Wednesday in a plenary session in which a simple majority would be needed to block it.The European Council also has a say in the issue and would also need a blocking majority to derail the proposal, say officials in Brussels.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I think also if I reach that I’ll be the first ever Chinese in Formula One. ""That’s definitely making myself proud, also make the country, the Chinese motorsport history, to have much more people following motorsport, following me and following the racing.""Zhou is not the first Chinese hopeful to make it to the brink of Formula One, with compatriots Ma Qing Hua and Dutch-born Ho-Pin Tung both testing Formula One cars in the past. The latter was even Renault’s reserve in 2010, the first Chinese driver to fill such a role, after the company that owned his management agency Genii Capital bought a large stake in the team that raced as Lotus for a period.But Zhou, whose love of motorsport began when he attended the first Chinese Grand Prix as a five-year-old in 2004, is the first to sign a deal with a manufacturer team and is showing promise.He finished in the points in both races in this month's Bahrain season-opener, including fourth in the Sunday sprint race, and is one place ahead of Michael Schumacher's son Mick in the standings.SECOND RACE A homegrown driver on the grid would only add heft to the sport's push to expand in a key market, with Formula One keen to add a second race in a country with a rapidly emerging middle class.""The last few years I didn’t actually get much chance to be here in the grand prix and I was doing more stuff in Europe,"" said Zhou, whose week of PR appearances and fan events culminated in a demonstration drive in a 2012 Formula One car in downtown Shanghai and at the track before the race.""This year, coming back, walking around Shanghai, there’s people knowing me from the city. ""Also here on the track, I was in the fanzone, the other side, next to the grandstand, everybody wants your autograph.""China is also an attractive market for carmakers like Renault but team principal Cyril Abiteboul said signing Zhou and Ye Yifei, another rising Chinese star announced as a member of Renault’s young driver academy last week, was not a commercial decision.""They are not here for marketing, they are not here for commercial purpose,"" said the Frenchman.""They are in the academy on merit because they deserve it because of their achievements so far and I hope they will achieve more in their respective categories.""Zhou's immediate challenge is to secure the superlicense points he needs to move up to Formula One and he knows that will only come with talent and hard work.""If I can do well and show everybody the potential then if I’m good enough, I’ll be more than happy to be in F1,"" he said.""And then once you have everything in hand at the same time you have to wait for the opportunities.

We should accept it, it's a shame for him and next time maybe it will be to his advantage.""Mercedes pitted Bottas first to protect him from Vettel, a move that reduced Hamilton's lead, and later on pitted the pair in a perfectly timed sequence with Hamilton leaving the box just as Bottas arrived.RICCIARDO SCORESGasly was sixth, ahead of  Renault  (PA:RENA)'s Daniel Ricciardo -- the Australian's first finish of the season after two retirements-- and Racing Point's Sergio Perez.Kimi Raikkonen finished ninth for Alfa Romeo and Thailand's Alexander Albon, who started from the pitlane after missing qualifying due to a heavy crash in final practice, took the final point for Toro Rosso.Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg, McLaren’s Lando Norris and Toro Rosso’s Daniil Kvyat were the three retirements.The last two and the other McLaren of Carlos Sainz were involved in a three-car tangle on the opening lap that resulted in a brief virtual safety car period.Kvyat was handed a drive-through penalty for causing the collision, a decision the Russian felt was unfair and needed clarifying."

GSMA, together with Daimler , Ford , PSA Group, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Samsung (KS:005930) , endorse a rival 5G standard. The Commission's decision will impact makers of telecoms companies providing the equipment for high-speed networks.ITS-G5 wifi-based technology primarily connects cars to other cars. The rival fifth generation, or 5G, standard hooks up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, with a wider range of applications in areas such as entertainment, traffic data and general navigation where data speeds or signal failure are less of an issue.However companies have not publicly argued in detail that one technology is better than the other, instead focusing on costs and what they are best placed to deliver.Mats Granryd, GSMA's director general, wrote in a letter to Parliament that the Commission proposal would not improve road safety.""This wifi standard was developed over a decade ago for the ITS-G5 framework. Despite being ready for many years, it has seen very little commercial deployment so far,"" he said. Granryd said that the alternative 5G was already commercially available globally since last year and gaining popularity as the standard for short- and long-range communications, with BMW, PSA and Ford ready to roll out 5G-equipped cars. A majority of EU lawmakers would need to block the Commission's plan. The next hurdle would be the European Council where a blocking majority would also be required to overturn the proposal.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

158,"Apr 09, 2019 04:14AM ET","In video address, Ghosn says he is innocent and victim of backstabbing",nan,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Tim KellyTOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said he was innocent and slammed former colleagues whom he accused of backstabbing and conspiring against him, in a pre-recorded video that marked his first public address since his initial arrest last year.Prosecutors took the highly unusual step of re-arresting Ghosn last week on fresh allegations that he used company funds to enrich himself to the tune of $5 million. The once-feted executive had been out on $9 million bail for 30 days, during which he recorded the video screened by his lawyers on Tuesday.In the video, shown to reporters in Tokyo, the former Nissan Motor Co chairman said he was the victim of selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese automaker and French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).Ghosn called out some individuals by name in the video but those references were removed due to legal concerns, his lead lawyer Junichiro Hironaka told reporters.The video - together with Hironaka's comments alleging harsh treatment by Tokyo prosecutors against Ghosn and his wife, Carole - cast Ghosn as the victim of both internal rivals and the Japanese judicial system.""This is a conspiracy ... this is not about greed or dictatorship, this is about a plot, this about a conspiracy, this is about a backstabbing,"" Ghosn said in the video.He was wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt. His hands were folded in front of him as he looked into the camera and spoke in a clipped, matter-of-fact manner. His hair appeared to be greyer and his face thinner than before last year's arrest. The conspiracy, he said, was borne out of fear that he would bring Nissan closer to its partner and top shareholder, Renault. ""There was fear that the next step of the alliance in terms of convergence and in terms of moving towards a merger, would in a certain way threaten some people or eventually threaten the autonomy of Nissan,"" he said.PHYSICAL, MENTAL PRESSUREHironaka told the briefing that prosecutors were acting in a ""cruel way"" and putting him under intense physical and mental pressure to get a confession.Prosecutors were not immediately available for comment.Hironaka has previously criticized the move by prosecutors to confiscate Ghosn's belongings, including his mobile phone and trial documents, along with the mobile phones and Lebanese passport of his wife, Carole, who was present when prosecutors entered their home early in the morning last Thursday.The lawyer said on Tuesday that Ghosn's wife, who left Japan last week, did so out of concern for her own safety, adding she intended to protest the case to the French government.However, France's finance minister said on Tuesday that political interventions might not be the best way to help Ghosn, raising some questions about how much pressure Paris was willing to put on Tokyo over the issue.The case has rocked the global auto industry and also shone a harsh light on Japan's judicial system.Under Japanese law, prosecutors are able to hold suspects for up to 22 days without charge and interrogate them without their lawyers present.Such procedures have focused much attention in the West on Japan's judicial system, which critics sometimes refer to as ""hostage justice"", because defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail.Ghosn has been charged with under-reporting his Nissan salary for a decade, and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books. However, the new, $5 million allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes.On Monday, Nissan shareholders ousted him as a director, severing his last tie with the automaker he rescued from near-bankruptcy two decades ago.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The EU executive declined to comment on the parliamentary committee vote.Parliament will vote on the Commission's proposal on April 17, which can only be blocked by a majority.

But they offered few concrete details about the way forward.""I can't comprehend how this could have happened, despite having auditors,"" said Setsuko Shibata, a retired homemaker who said her family had held Nissan shares for decades. ""I can't say I feel better about the situation after today's explanation.""Ghosn has denied all the allegations against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup.Proceedings were at times interrupted by some hecklers on the floor of the meeting, which was attended by a near record-high 4,100 shareholders.The shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and co-accused Greg Kelly from Nissan's board of directors. Kelly has also denied the charges against him.They also voted in Senard as a director, a move that was widely seen as an attempt to assuage concern about the future of the Nissan-Renault automaking alliance engineered by Ghosn.ALLEGATIONSProsecutors last week took the highly unusual step of re-arresting Ghosn - who had been out on $9 million bail - returning him to the Tokyo detention center where he had previously spent more than 100 days.Under the latest allegations, he is suspected of trying to enrich himself to the tune of $5 million at the automaker's expense.Ghosn's lawyers called the arrest an attempt to muzzle him. He was due to speak at a news conference this week, but instead a video statement from him will be shown on Tuesday at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan (FCCJ), the FCCJ said on its website. Ghosn has been charged with under-reporting his Nissan salary for a decade, and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books. However, the new allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes. SHAREHOLDERS BAFFLEDBoth Saikawa and Senard talked about the need to focus more on unity and respect among executives and workers, although neither offered details on the outlook for their complex capital structure, in which smaller Renault owns a bigger share of Nissan.""I will constantly suggest the best possible evolutions in the framework of the alliance,"" Senard said after voters approved his appointment to Nissan's board. ""We want to secure the right future for Nissan,"" he said, without elaborating.The fall of one of the world's most-feted executives appeared to have left some Nissan shareholders nonplussed.""I was hoping to hear more details about the path forward. I wanted to know what sort of role a Japanese company can play in an international alliance like this,"" said a shareholder who declined to be identified for personal privacy issues.""The situation seems to go deeper than it looks based on the information,"" said 68-year-old shareholder Roberto Montoya. ""I'm very suspicious of the situation, and most people are.""Saikawa said Nissan may claim damages against Ghosn and that he did not want to pay severance to the former chair. He also said he would work to stabilize the company before standing down as chief executive.""This is not an issue we can fix overnight,"" Saikawa told shareholders.

Public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday that prosecutors suspected Ghosn siphoned off payments through a company where his wife is an executive to purchase a yacht and a boat.The prosecutors asked her to meet them for voluntary questioning as an unsworn witness, but the request was turned down, which prompted them to ask judges to question her on their behalf, the broadcaster said.Such a request gives judges the power to question on a mandatory basis witnesses who refuse to testify, according to NHK. Ghosn's lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said on Thursday prosecutors confiscated Ghosn's mobile phone, documents, notebooks and diaries, along with his wife's passport and mobile phone.The FT said prosecutors had confiscated his wife's Lebanese passport in a dawn raid on their apartment in central Tokyo on Thursday morning, but did not discover her U.S. passport.""I'm all alone here.

163,"Apr 04, 2019 09:10AM ET",The Renault-Nissan Alliance Against Carlos Ghosn,nan,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The downfall of Carlos Ghosn, once idolized as the globe-trotting genius who turned France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. into the world’s biggest automaking alliance, is turning into a tale of back-stabbing politics, corporate self-interest and excessive greed worthy of grand opera. It’s hard to see how anyone comes out of this looking like a hero – and that goes for Renault and Nissan, too.The story so far goes something like this: Act I saw the shocking arrest of Ghosn at the hands of the Japanese on allegations of financial misconduct, including using company funds for personal investments and misusing corporate assets, which bore the hallmarks of a palace coup against France’s dominance. Act II saw Renault and Nissan agree to patch up their differences and move on from the Ghosn era, with the blessing of their political paymasters in Paris and Tokyo. Act III, still underway, is a drip-feed of lurid allegations of excess under Ghosn’s tenure – corporate jets, funding family start-ups, a party in Versailles – while the ex-chief executive officer awaits his trial and protests his innocence.How does the saga end? Judging by Japan’s terrifyingly high conviction rate of 99 percent, the odds are increasingly stacked against Ghosn. The Japanese are still digging up fresh allegations, and building up their case: Ghosn dismissed as “outrageous and arbitrary” his re-arrest on Thursday on allegations that he used millions of dollars from Nissan for his own purposes. The French state – which owns 15 percent of Renault – has been far more protective of Renault’s interests than Ghosn’s, meekly protesting against the conditions of his imprisonment. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire says Ghosn is like “any other person facing the justice system.”But for all the talk of due process, there is obviously a fair bit of political expediency and corporate self-interest in hanging Ghosn out to dry. The case is being played out in the court of public opinion before even going to trial, and the former CEO does not cut a sympathetic figure: Wealthy, powerful, pampered and clearly not very humble. Emmanuel Macron, under fire from angry French street protesters for being a “president of the rich,” was never going to defend Ghosn with great enthusiasm. Renault and Nissan, mindful of their plan to boost revenues by a third by 2022, have an obvious desire to avoid reputational and legal risk and so have joined forces to investigate allegations of misconduct against Ghosn. The more tales that emerge from the companies’ investigations, the greater the risk that they have to share in the blame. Four private jets is obviously excessive – but Ghosn says the companies knew about them. Renault has alerted prosecutors to payments made by Ghosn to a distributor in Oman that may have been used to repay personal debts – but Ghosn’s team said they were performance-related bonuses. Renault said his famous Marie-Antoinette-themed party at Versailles was improperly funded via a charitable donation agreement, but the ex-CEO said he didn’t know and wasn’t even billed for the event. The corporate governance structure and boards of Renault-Nissan surely played their part in letting Ghosn get away with a good chunk of his imperious behavior. For over a decade, he was Chairman and CEO of each of Renault, Nissan, and the Netherlands-based alliance structure that united the two. The French government, through its stake, allowed him to stay in the top role for too long. His downfall may be a catalyst for positive changes: Renault's new boss, Jean-Dominique Senard, is said to be considering replacing at least two members of the carmaker's board to make it less of a ""rubber-stamp"" operation, according to Bloomberg News. But this is too little, and too late.However this story ends, it’s a savage indictment of both corporate excess and the mish-mash of state interests that supported Ghosn and allowed him free reign at the world’s biggest automaker. French-style capitalism, lop-sided partnerships and Japanese justice have left Renault-Nissan looking weaker than ever."

Nissan had previously established its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Oman distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA).Ghosn's spokesman has said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Oman firm being a top Nissan dealer.

The first tweet from the @carlosghosn account on the social network at 12:51 p.m. (0351 GMT) read, ""I'm getting ready to tell the truth about what's happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11."" It did not specify a time or place.Featuring a photo of a smiling, grey-haired Ghosn standing in front of a tree with seasonal cherry blossoms, the account initially lacked the blue tick mark to show it had been verified by the social network. That left journalists unsure of its authenticity - particularly as the conditions of Ghosn's $9 million bail preclude him from using the internet.Forty minutes later, when the blue tick appeared, the tweet swept across social media and the account's followers swelled to almost 20,000, from just a handful earlier. Some of the replies appeared sympathetic to Ghosn, with others carrying photos of his now-famous exit from a Tokyo detention center last month.""Stood right alongside you with #GiveGhosnBail. Looking forward to hearing your side,"" wrote one Twitter user with the name @highmileage. Ghosn had also caught media off guard when he disguised himself in a workman's uniform, cap and face mask to try and give waiting reporters the slip on leaving the detention center after his release on bail. The architect of the Nissan and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) global alliance was then pursued by media as he rode away in a small work van, a Suzuki, topped with a ladder.Ghosn's dramatic fall from grace began with his arrest in November after getting off a private plane at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. He has since been charged with financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust. On Wednesday, the Yomiuri newspaper said Tokyo prosecutors will soon decide whether to prosecute Ghosn on further charges. A further arrest could jeopardize the planned news conference. It remains unclear if Ghosn sent the tweet or it was sent on his behalf. His bail conditions allow him to access a computer at his lawyer's office but forbid him to use the internet.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nissan is also included in the indictment for making false disclosures in annual securities reports, for which the company has expressed regret.""No matter how you look at it, having Ghosn sit alongside Nissan at the trial would be peculiar, it would go against his right to a fair trial,"" his main defense lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told a briefing.Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November after Nissan told prosecutors its own investigation uncovered evidence of his wrongdoing.

Ghosn, now ousted as chairman of Nissan, denies the charges, as does Kelly.Ghosn faces criminal charges in Japan over failing to report around $82 million in salary from Nissan, and for temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the global financial crisis.""It's right that his lawyers wouldn't want Ghosn to stand trial with Nissan. Nissan will plead guilty and that would clearly influence the mood of the trial,"" said Nobuo Gohara, a lawyer who heads Gohara Compliance and Law Office, which is not involved in the Ghosn case.OMAN CONNECTIONHironaka, a high-profile defense lawyer dubbed ""the razor"" for his courtroom prowess, told the briefing that his team wanted Ghosn's case separated from that of Kelly's because the American is a potential key witness for the Ghosn defense.Tokyo prosecutors were not immediately available to comment on Ghosn's lawyers' requests. A Nissan spokesman said the company could not comment on judicial procedures. Hironaka also said he did not rule out the possibility of further charges against Ghosn in Tokyo.Reuters reported on Monday that Renault had alerted French prosecutors to payments made to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman, citing three sources.Renault has established it paid out millions of euros described as dealer incentives to Omani distributor Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA) over five years from around 2011, said the sources, who were briefed on the findings. Hironaka told the briefing he was aware of the report but had not spoken to Ghosn about it. Ghosn's French lawyers have denied the allegations of potential embezzlement in Oman.Nissan had previously found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to SBA.Responding last month to earlier reports about the Nissan payments via SBA, a Ghosn family spokesman said: ""The dealer incentive payments were directed by regional heads, not the CEO, and rewarded top performing dealers around the world.""Nissan is holding an extraordinary shareholders meeting next week to vote to remove Ghosn and Kelly as directors, and Hironaka said there was no plan to appeal if shareholders vote to depose the former executives.An external committee reviewing governance at Nissan said last week there were enough facts to suspect violations of laws and the private use of company funds by Ghosn.It described a corporate culture at Nissan ""in which no one can make any objections to Mr. Ghosn"", who was ""in a way deified within Nissan as a savior who had redeemed Nissan from collapse"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

169,"Apr 01, 2019 06:21PM ET",Exclusive: Renault alerts prosecutors to Oman dealer payments under Ghosn,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has alerted French prosecutors to payments made to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman under former Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, three sources told Reuters.This follows an internal investigation by the French carmaker after Ghosn's November arrest in Japan for suspected financial misconduct at its alliance partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd .Renault has established it paid out millions of euros described as dealer incentives to Omani distributor Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA) over five years from around 2011, said the sources, who were briefed on the findings. Nissan previously found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to SBA.But the information sent to French prosecutors shows that much of the cash was then channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said.The total sum paid by Renault is in the double-digit millions, one source said.""We categorically deny the allegations of potential embezzlement in Oman,"" Ghosn's French lawyer Jean-Yves Le Borgne said, declining further comment.Renault spokesman Frederic Texier declined to comment, while the French financial prosecutor's office did not respond to requests for comment and SBA could not be reached for comment.Responding last month to earlier reports about the Nissan payments via SBA, a Ghosn family spokesman said: ""The dealer incentive payments were directed by regional heads, not the CEO, and rewarded top performing dealers around the world.""Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan on charges that he failed to report $82 million in Nissan pay he had arranged to receive after retirement. He has also been indicted for transferring personal investment losses to Nissan and steering $14.7 million in company funds to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali.Renault initially sought to avoid being drawn into the investigation initiated by Nissan - which ousted Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest - and for weeks avoided sharing the Japanese partner's findings with its own board.But Ghosn was eventually forced out as Renault chairman and CEO in January, when  Michelin  (PA:MICP) veteran Jean-Dominique Senard was appointed chairman, and the alliance partners embarked on an independent audit of their joint finances the following month.FOUR JETSBorn in Brazil to Lebanese parents, Ghosn, 65, returned to Lebanon as a child and retains a powerful network of friends and associates there. A Beirut house was among several properties around the world that were purchased by Nissan for his use, as the company's investigation revealed early on.The joint audit of the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organization has tallied 1.2 million euros ($1.34 million) in Lebanese donations and other spending of questionable benefit to the carmakers, among preliminary results presented to Renault directors this week, two people familiar with the matter said.The audit is examining the use of four corporate jets financed by the Dutch-registered subsidiary and payments of around 170,000 euros annually to Carlos Abou Jaoude, Ghosn's personal lawyer in Lebanon, over six years, the sources said. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the lawyer.In an earlier complaint filed with French prosecutors in February, Renault turned over evidence that the 50,000-euro rental cost of Ghosn's Chateau de Versailles wedding in 2016 had been improperly charged to the company.But the alleged Oman connection may deepen Renault's exposure to the scandal unearthed by its Japanese partner, which has strained their 20-year-old alliance, and raises questions about governance at the French parent company.Cash from Ghosn's own ""CEO office"" budgets at Renault as well as Nissan moved through the regional sales divisions to SBA and on to a Lebanese intermediary, ""Good Faith Investments Holding"", the three people briefed on the findings said.From there it flowed on to privately held entities including a British Virgin Islands-registered vehicle that paid for a $15 million yacht, they said.Renault's findings, delivered to prosecutors late last week, also include evidence suggesting that some of the funds were passed to a California-based company co-founded by Carlos Ghosn's son, Anthony Ghosn, the sources said.There was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Anthony Ghosn or that he knew about the origin of the funds invested in his firm, Shogun Investments LLC. The Ghosn family spokesman, who also represents Anthony, declined to comment.Carlos Ghosn has not been charged with any offences in relation to the findings of either carmaker concerning incentive payments to SBA, the Omani partner, the spokesman added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""He drove such a great race. We’ve got work to do to keep these guys off our tails,” added the Briton, who hugged Leclerc after they stepped out of their cars.Leclerc’s problems capped an already difficult day for Ferrari, who had swept the front row in qualifying, with Sebastian Vettel’s race having already unrivalled. The German, who finished fifth, spun while defending second place from Hamilton and then lost his front wing in a spectacular shower of sparks. The only consolation for Leclerc, on the podium for the first time in his F1 career, was an extra point for setting the fastest lap of the race.""It's a very hard one to take,” said the youngster. ""It's a shame to only finish third, but it's part of racing and we'll come back stronger.""Hamilton’s win in Bahrain was the 74th of his career but first this season. The Briton stayed second in the championship but is now just one point shy of overall leader Bottas, who won and scored the extra point for fastest lap in Australia.Max Verstappen finished fourth for Red Bull ahead of Vettel.British rookie Lando Norris put in a fine drive for McLaren to finish sixth ahead of Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikkonen, Leclerc's predecessor at Ferrari.Frenchman Pierre Gasly brought his Red Bull home in eighth ahead of Toro Rosso’s Thai driver Alexander Albon and Mexican Sergio Perez, who rounded out the top 10 for Racing Point.Hamilton is now 17 wins short of Michael Schumacher's all-time record of 91.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Daimler's German rival BMW recently unveiled plans to build electric Minis in China, where production costs are low and demand for small electric cars is rising.Daimler and Geely did not disclose financial terms of their deal. The details of the joint venture will be finalised by the end of 2019, they said in a joint press release.Daimler currently develops and builds Smart cars with  Renault  (PA:RENA), and constructs the small vehicles at factories in France and Slovenia.The Daimler factory in Hambach, France, will be retooled to build Mercedes-Benz cars, it said.Geely has been expanding rapidly through mergers and acquisitions since 2010, when it acquired Swedish carmaker Volvo from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Last year, Daimler and Geely set up a ride-hailing joint venture in China.Daimler's Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said last month the German carmaker was in talks to deepen its alliance with Geely after the Chinese's group's chairman Li Shufu bought a 9.69 percent stake in Daimler in 2018.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

179,"Mar 27, 2019 10:05AM ET",Nissan committee says facts point to legal violations by former chairman Ghosn,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - An external committee reviewing governance at Nissan Motor Co said on Wednesday there were enough facts to suspect violations of laws and the private use of company funds by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn.Following a three-month audit of Nissan's governance after a scandal that shook the global auto industry, the committee put the blame squarely on what it called Ghosn's concentration of power. It also acknowledged Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa's role in Ghosn's salary arrangement at the heart of the scandal.Twenty years to the day since French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) agreed to rescue Nissan, the committee described a corporate culture at Nissan ""in which no one can make any objections to Mr. Ghosn"", who was ""in a way deified within Nissan as a savior who had redeemed Nissan from collapse.""The group issued 38 recommendations to bolster Nissan's governance, including that top executive positions at the Japanese carmaker should not be held by people serving in executive positions at Renault or junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp.It also proposed that the majority of directors, including the chairman of the board, be independent, outside directors and that the role of company chairman be abolished. The recommendations from the external, seven-member committee come weeks after Nissan and Renault said they would retool their alliance, one of the world's biggest automakers, to break up the all-powerful chairmanship previously held by Ghosn.""There are facts sufficient to suspect violations of laws and regulations, violation of internal rules and private use of company funds and expenses... by Mr. Ghosn,"" the committee said in its report.It also singled out Nissan director Greg Kelly, who too has been indicted, for his alleged role in helping Ghosn avoid oversight, and said that Saikawa had signed documents regarding compensation Ghosn would receive after retirement.""It is clear that there are issues requiring improvement with respect to Nissan's governance as it could not prevent the misconduct.""Ghosn, who this month was released on $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention center, has called the charges against him ""meritless"". Kelly has also denied the charges.""We expect Nissan will take these recommendations seriously and execute them in a swift manner to build the best possible governance structure,"" committee co-chair Seiichiro Nishioka told a briefing in Yokohama.At the briefing, the committee declined to comment on whether other individual directors - including Saikawa - should be held for responsible for failing to prevent the alleged actions by Ghosn. MERGER TALKS?Nishioka also told the briefing that the capital structure between Nissan and Renault was a matter for the companies, and it was not appropriate for the committee to get involved.The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Renault intends to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months, after which it will set sight on a bid to buy Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.The plans signal a return to the strategies supported by Ghosn, who held talks about merging Renault with Fiat Chrysler two to three years ago, the Financial Times, which cited sources familiar with the matter, adding the French government had opposed the move.Nissan has said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the most feted executives in the global auto industry who orchestrated Nissan's financial recovery in the early 2000s and created the blueprint for the automaking alliance between Nissan and Renault.At the time of his arrest in Tokyo in November on financial misconduct allegations, Ghosn held the chairmanship at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which together form one of the world's biggest automakers selling roughly 10 million vehicles each year, while also serving as Renault CEO.Nissan's board currently comprises nine directors including the chairman, three of whom are categorized as outside, independent directors. Two directors, including one outside director, formerly served senior vice president roles at Renault.In a statement, Nissan said that its board of directors would review the committee's proposals ""with the greatest attention as soon as possible"". It has said it will put forward proposals to change the company's governance at its general shareholders meeting in June.Before that, it will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting next month to vote on the ouster of Ghosn and Kelly, who has been charged alongside Ghosn for understating Ghosn's salary, as company directors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

180,"Mar 27, 2019 08:20AM ET",The Car Giants Are Getting Pretty Desperate,nan,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In view of the bad feeling unleashed by Japan’s detention of Carlos Ghosn in November, one might have expected  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to keep things quiet for a while. Ghosn was head of the giant Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance and one theory for his downfall was that he was pushing too hard for a full combination of the French and Japanese companies.But now, according to the Financial Times, Renault SA hopes to restart those merger talks with Nissan Motor Co within 12 months and then launch a bid for another big carmaker, possibly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. This is surprising, to put it mildly. Seeking fresh discussions about a tie-up risks opening barely healed wounds in Tokyo.That Renault would even consider such a move suggests relations with Nissan have improved since Ghosn was ousted. But even more than that, it underscores the desperation of carmakers as they try to respond to the industry’s epochal challenge: The hugely expensive shift to electric and automated vehicles.The history of automotive M&A hasn’t been a happy one; Daimler’s takeover of Chrysler is but one of many failed marriages. So it’s remarkable how lively the carmaker courtship rumor mill has been lately.  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) has reportedly approached Fiat; Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. are trying to deepen a nascent partnership; and fierce rivals  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG are teaming up in autonomous driving and car sharing. Elsewhere, Jaguar Land Rover’s heavy losses might put it in play, Daimler may sell a stake in its loss-making Smart unit and the FT says Ghosn courted Fiat when he was still Renault boss.One word explains all this frantic positioning: Scale. The more electric cars a manufacturer can produce, the less burdensome the investments in new technology and plants. The same goes for software, which will become even more pivotal (and costly) once cars drive themselves.It’s in the interest of both Nissan and Renault, then, to maintain their 20-year old cost-sharing alliance. Unpicking it would be hugely expensive, especially now that key markets like China and the U.S. are slowing down.But a full-blown merger is something else entirely. Surely they have enough problems to manage without attempting that. The immediate priority is embedding a new governance system at Nissan and the alliance, to replace the dominance of Ghosn. His departure helps, but the French and Japanese sides still have a long way to go to restore trust.In fairness, the alliance now has a new boss, the understated Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, who brings a more placatory approach. Nissan may be open to renegotiating the alliance’s capital structure if Senard proves reliable, the FT reported, citing people close to the Japanese group.But this is almost certain to be a fraught endeavor, regardless of the personalities at the top. Unpicking a clearly unbalanced cross-shareholding structure (Renault holds 43 per cent of Nissan, whereas the more profitable Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault) is a delicate enough task in view of the French state’s stake in Renault. Trying to then agree merger terms that both parties consider fair would be harder still. If you take away its holding in Nissan, the stock market ascribes little value to Renault’s own carmaking operations.Meanwhile, these deliberations would be taking place at the same time as Ghosn’s trial, which will no doubt be a huge distraction for both companies in the coming months.And what of Fiat? Its U.S. trucks and SUV profits are attractive, but does the Renault-Nissan alliance (which includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp.) really need to get any bigger? It already sells more than 10 million cars a year. That’s on a par with industry giants Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp.If you think the politics of Nissan and Renault are thorny, just try to add Fiat Chrysler’s Italian and American mix. Another French carmaker, the less geographically diverse Peugeot, is more in need of an international dance partner like Fiat. France also owns a stake in Peugeot.There’s also the problem of job cuts at a time of rising populism. It only makes sense for automakers to consolidate if they’re willing to close excess capacity and share resources. Merge or not, the car industry will probably shed thousands of jobs over the next decade: Building an electric car is about 30 percent less labor intensive than a combustion engine model.As such, you can see why companies will consider even the most impossible-looking deals. That doesn’t mean they can be done."

German 10-year yields, already below zero percent since last Friday, fell further in negative territory, while the U.S. bond yield curve remained inverted - a key signal of recession - dampened appetite for risk.The pan-region STOXX 600 index fell 0.4 percent as indexes slipped across the region, led by bourses in Paris and London. The moves were reminiscent of late last week, when investors ditched equities to run to the safety of bonds after weak European and U.S. data on Friday stoked global growth fears. Investors remain anxious with a part of the U.S. yield curve inverted, Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, wrote in a note. Acknowledging the growth worries, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Wednesday the European Central Bank could further delay a planned increase in interest rates if it needs to, and may look at measures to mitigate the effects of negative interest rates. Draghi's comments had propped up banking stocks in the region but a more than 7 percent fall in Swedbank limited gains. The Swedish Economic Crime Authority said it was searching the bank's head office as part of a probe into whether insider trading regulations were breached. Defensives such as utilities, real estate and healthcare stocks slipped the most on the STOXX. Merck KGaA was down 0.7 percent after the German pharma group launched a hostile $5.9 billion all-cash takeover offer for Versum Materials to boost its presence in the semiconductor materials market. The auto sector was the only major bright spot on the STOXX after five-straight sessions of losses, with Fiat Chrysler leading gains after a Financial Times report indicated that French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) was considering a bid for the company.Daimler AG's rose 1 percent after it said it was nearing the sale of a 50 percent stake in its small-car brand Smart to China's Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.London's FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent ahead of a closely watched vote by British lawmakers at 1900 GMT on a range of options on how to overcome the political impasse over Brexit.""The Brexit vote taking place today is not legally binding so its just a political measure of fleshing out or mapping out of what British lawmakers or MPs would like to see in their version of the deal,"" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets.British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to indicate a date for quitting as the price for getting her twice-defeated Brexit deal ratified. As the United Kingdom's three-year Brexit crisis spins towards its finale, it is still uncertain how, when or even if it will leave the European Union.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

182,"Mar 27, 2019 05:09AM ET",StockBeat: Markets Fall as Draghi's Magic Wears Thin,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Mario Draghi made his reputation by promising “to do whatever it takes” to save the euro. It says a lot for the faulty design of the euro zone that his language has barely changed even though he’s now well into the last year of his mandate.In a keynote speech on Wednesday, Draghi wrapped up by saying “the ECB will adopt all the monetary policy actions that are necessary and proportionate to achieve its objective.”If you look closely enough, the only material difference is that the question is no longer the immediate existential one of the euro’s survival, but rather the ECB’s inability to meet its mandated task of keeping prices stable (inflation has undershot the medium-term target consistently over the last decade). What has not changed is the need to beg the markets for trust.The appeal is starting to wear thin. When the ECB announced its latest attempts to prop up the economy with cheap long-term loans, markets slumped. This morning euro zone stock markets have turned lower, once again focusing on the implications of Draghi’s gloomy assessment of the economy rather than his promise to fix it.“We are now seeing a more persistent deterioration of external demand,” Draghi said, and markets listened. They appeared not to bother with the next sentence: “But a “soft patch"" does not necessarily foreshadow a serious slump.”By 05:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.12 points, less than 0.1%, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.1%, the French CAC 40 down 0.2% and the Spanish IBEX 35 down 0.1%.It’s not hard to see why: housing and consumer confidence data out of the U.S. on Tuesday were miserable. China reported overnight that profits at its largest industrial companies fell 14% on the year in the first two months of 2019. Italian business and consumer confidence surveys, released this morning, have both fallen in March, and by more than expected.Away from monetary policy, the biggest noise in the market this morning is from the auto sector, where  Renault  (PA:RENA) is up more than 3% after a Financial Times report saying that it wants to acquire Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) once it has completed a relaunched merger with Nissan (OTC:NSANY) that was put on ice by CEO Carlos Ghosn’s tax troubles.The more important element of the story is arguably not so much Renault’s desire, but the tantalising suggestion that Fiat could be the subject of a takeover battle, given that  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) has also reportedly approached it. Merger optimism needs to be weighed against the likelihood of any Italian government approving such a deal, however."

Ghosn has said the charges were ""meritless"".The recent formation of a new alliance board led by Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard has led to an increase in confidence that the two parties can now push ahead with the merger plans, according to the FT report.Fiat Chrysler is also seeking a partnership or merger and the company is holding talks with rivals for a deal, the report said.Nissan and Renault are also expected to revamp their boards, with Renault reducing its board's size and Nissan adding majority outside directors, the report added.

184,"Mar 26, 2019 10:12PM ET",Nissan panel to propose bigger role for external directors in Ghosn scandal's wake,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - A committee tasked with revamping corporate governance at Nissan Motor Co is expected to recommend on Wednesday a bigger role for external directors in overseeing the Japanese automaker following Carlos Ghosn's arrest and ouster as chairman. The independent panel will announce the results of its three-month audit of Nissan's governance-related procedures, as the company seeks to draw a line under a near two-decade-long period during which Ghosn wielded outsized influence in his dual roles as its chairman and CEO for much of that time.To decentralize the power structure at Japan's second-largest automaker, the seven-member committee will likely also suggest that the company establish committees for board member nominations, auditing and for determining executive pay, according to a person familiar with the matter. It may also recommend splitting the positions of company chairman, a role held by veteran top executives, and chairman of the board, who presides over board meetings, and that the latter position should be held by an external director.The committee was not immediately reachable for comment, but has previously declined to comment on the matter. It will hold a briefing on Wednesday evening to release the recommendations.Like executives at many Japanese companies, Ghosn held both chairmanship positions at Nissan, adding to his influence at the automaker. Nissan has said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the most feted executives in the global auto industry who orchestrated Nissan's financial recovery in the early 2000s and created the blueprint for the automaking alliance between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).At the time of his arrest in Tokyo in November on financial misconduct allegations, Ghosn held the chairmanship at Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which together form one of the world's biggest automakers, while also serving as Renault CEO.Ghosn is facing charges related to under-reporting his Nissan salary by around $82 million over nearly a decade, and for temporarily shifting personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the global financial crisis. He denies the charges and has argued that his arrest and ouster from Nissan were orchestrated by executives at the company who were opposed to his plans for closer ties with Renault. REBALANCED ALLIANCENissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors are retooling their partnership to create a more equal footing between them. Bound by complex cross-shareholdings, the three companies aim to leverage their combined scale to reduce costs for development, procurement and production.Earlier this month, the three automakers announced they would create an operating board headed by top executives from each of the companies which would oversee the partnership's operations and governance - a role largely held by Ghosn alone in the past.The newly appointed chairman of Renault, Jean-Dominique Senard, will serve as head of the alliance but - in a critical sign of the rebalancing - not as company chairman of Nissan, a position which could be left vacant for now, according to people with knowledge of the issue.Nissan is considering asking ex-Toray Industries chief and Japan Inc heavyweight Sadayuki Sakakibara, who served on the reform committee, to take on the role of chairman of the board at the automaker.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

186,"Mar 20, 2019 05:45AM ET",Counting the cost: Nissan unpicks Ghosn legacy of 'high-handedness' and 'wrongdoings',nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - In September 2007, despite weighty responsibilities at the helm of Nissan Motor Co and alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Carlos Ghosn found time to get involved in a seemingly straightforward business decision.Two days before Nissan's executive committee was due to formalize the choice of a company called TVS as a partner for sales and marketing in India, Ghosn threw his weight behind a different firm: Hover Automotive India Pvt Ltd, four company sources with knowledge of the matter said.Hover had been a candidate but was knocked out of the running because it had been deemed insufficiently experienced in automotive distribution and marketing, they said. However, its founder and chairman, Moez Mangalji, was a close family friend of Ghosn's, the sources added.A Nissan executive wrote to the team preparing for the committee meeting saying it was Ghosn's wish that Hover be recommended over TVS, two of the sources said, adding that this was enough to ensure Hover got the job.The incident is part of Nissan's wide-ranging probe into what it calls years of serious misconduct by Ghosn. There is no evidence of Ghosn benefiting from the decision but it is an example of conduct investigators believe helped his friends at Nissan's expense, the two sources added.A spokesman for Ghosn said the former Nissan chairman did not intervene on behalf of Hover, that Hover met key criteria to launch the distribution business, and all partnership decisions were made by Nissan's executive committee. ""The baseless accusations against Mr. Ghosn and steady stream of leaks from certain Nissan executives are a transparent and dishonorable attempt to smear Mr. Ghosn's reputation, destabilize and reset the balance of power in the Alliance, and distract from Nissan's alarming performance,"" the statement from Ghosn's spokesman said.The spokesman declined repeated requests by Reuters to be identified, citing the ""sensitive nature of the topics.""A representative for Mangalji said Hover employed experts with substantial experience and ""that at no point was Hover aware of any special treatment on its behalf by Mr Ghosn or anyone else.""Ghosn would continue to back Hover even after Nissan dealers in India began protesting in 2012 to executives about a collapse in sales, according to the sources, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the subject.Those protests grew in 2013, with some groups representing Nissan's India dealers sending letters to senior executives, imploring them to step in, and Nissan ultimately dropped Hover as a partner the next year.An internal Nissan document that summarizes some of the decision-making around the choice of Hover and which one source said was created in 2014, was also reviewed by Reuters. Company insiders say the Hover episode was a defining moment for some managers inside Nissan, leading them to question the agenda of a man who had been universally lauded for bringing Nissan back from the brink of bankruptcy.At the same time, the sources acknowledge there was little resistance among the executive committee and other management to Ghosn's support for Hover and one other dealership decision in the Middle East that had raised eyebrows within Nissan.""In so many ways it was assumed that what he said would not need to be questioned. That applies to just about every decision he made,"" one of the sources said.TOO MUCH POWERLooking back at Ghosn's reign, it is clear that too much power was concentrated in one man, and that management did not do enough, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa told employees in a town hall meeting one week after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest. ""For 19 years, management, myself included, we allowed his high-handedness, allowed wrongdoings, and regret for that is what I think we all feel,"" he said, according to a copy of his speech reviewed by Reuters.""Our biggest and most urgent task....is to undo the negative legacy that resulted from years of Ghosn's leadership and corporate governance,"" he added.Last week, Nissan and major shareholder Renault said they would break up the all-powerful chairmanship position held by Ghosn, with the chairman of Renault serving as head of the alliance but not as chairman of Nissan.An external committee is due to make recommendations this month on changing Nissan's corporate governance including procedures for executive appointments and compensation.The re-evaluation of Ghosn's legacy is also driving a broader shift in Nissan's strategy, particularly Ghosn's practice of setting ambitious objectives for sales and profitability called 'commitments', where managers were held to account if they were not delivered.""If you couldn't meet them then you'd be in trouble, those numerical targets came to feel like threats,"" Saikawa told the town hall meeting. ""Now, we have to change this, work out something that is healthier.""PLETHORA OF ACCUSATIONSNot until 2017 did a lone internal auditor, Hidetoshi Imazu, discreetly start making checks into dealings that Nissan now says were orchestrated by Ghosn.Imazu had been aware of queries by Nissan's external auditor Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC about the purpose of a Dutch unit Zi-A Capital, according to one source. Payments for Nissan-owned luxury apartments used by Ghosn were made through Zi-A Capital and its units, sources have previously said. Imazu's concerns also followed a June 2017 Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan-bonuses/exclusive-renault-nissan-considers-hidden-bonus-plan-documents-idUSKBN1941FU that Renault-Nissan alliance bankers had drawn up plans to pay millions of dollars in undisclosed bonuses to Ghosn and other managers through a separate Dutch unit, the source said. Saikawa would only learn of the probe around October last year after Imazu and Hari Nada, head of Nissan's CEO office and an ally Imazu later teamed up with, had turned their findings over to prosecutors, two sources said.Nissan declined to make Imazu, Nada and Saikawa available for comment on this article.Tokyo prosecutors have accused Ghosn of under-reporting $82 million in compensation for 2010-2018 - pay he had arranged to receive after his retirement. He has also been charged with temporarily shifting personal losses to Nissan after a foreign exchange contract went sour and improperly steering $14.7 million in Nissan funds to a firm owned by Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali.Ghosn has said he is innocent and believed the compensation arrangements had been vetted by experts. Both Ghosn and the Khaled Juffali Company have asserted the $14.7 million in payments were for legitimate business purposes.""Mr. Ghosn is innocent of the charges brought against him and he will be vindicated,"" the statement from Ghosn's spokesman said. Nissan investigators continue to pursue a number of other leads with the probe expanding as whistleblowers come forward, one source said.The alleged schemes took so long to come to light, sources with knowledge of the probe said, due to Ghosn's practice of conveying his wishes verbally to trusted lieutenants rather than in writing. Many payments were made via the 'CEO Reserve', a budget for unplanned expenses, and were made through unconsolidated units which did not require vetting by the CFO or external auditors, they said.In addition to the case involving Juffali, one key focus of the automaker's probe is a sum of more than $30 million in Nissan funds Ghosn arranged to have transferred via the CEO Reserve to a Nissan distributor in Oman owned by businessman Suhail Bahwan and whether the money was used to repay personal debt, the sources said.Ghosn's spokesman said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Bahwan firm being a top Nissan dealer. Such dealer incentives were not directed by the CEO and the funds were not used to pay any personal debt for Ghosn, the spokesman added.One of the Nissan sources countered that dealer rewards were a planned event each year and were not paid via the CEO Reserve.A spokesman for Bahwan did not respond to requests for comment.The probe is also looking at the amount of money spent on Nissan-owned residences in Paris, Beirut and Rio de Janeiro and how the payments were made through units.Ghosn's spokesman said officials at Nissan, including Saikawa and Nada, had been aware of and had approved of the provision of the residences. Investigators are also examining payments to Ghosn's sister, Claudine Bichara de Oliveira, for what two sources describe as a fictitious job advising on global donation activities.Those payments date back to 2003 and total nearly $700,000 through 2016, documents seen by Reuters show.An internal Nissan letter dated March 27, 2003 shows Ghosn asked Oliveira if she would work for Nissan's global donation advisory council and that she signed the agreement. A source said, however, there was no evidence that the council existed.The spokesman, who also represents Ghosn's sister, said appropriate officials had approved the contract with the sister, and that Nissan officials opposed to Ghosn were attacking his family with false accusations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But on Monday, the Champs Elysees looked more like a construction site.On their 18th Saturday of protests against President Emmanuel Macron and his policies, France's Gilets Jaunes ('yellow vest') movement targeted the tree-lined avenue that runs from the Arc de Triomphe, smashing banks, ransacking restaurants, burning newspaper kiosks and looting luxury stores.From GAP to leather goods maker Longchamp, from Levis to high-end bakery Laduree, a hard core of violent protesters threw cobble stones through pane-glass windows, scrawled graffiti on walls, set fire to half a dozen newspaper stands and torched famed restaurant Le Fouquet's in an orgy of destruction.Whether the Disney store or Samsung (KS:005930), Tissot, Zara or Dior, few major retailers were left untouched by the rampage, which also took in a cinema, Hugo Boss, a  Renault  (PA:RENA) branded cafe, an Iran Air office and banks from  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) to HSBC.Among those that did emerge unscathed, perhaps thanks to heavy boarding-up after previous bouts of vandalism, were Apple's flagship store, Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF). and Louis Vuitton.Carpenters were cutting wood to board up shattered windows on Monday morning, and glass panes were being replaced in some bus-stops and storefronts, but stretches of the wide avenue remained a mess, with the smell of charred paper and metal hanging over the incinerated carcasses of newspaper kiosks.""It's a bit of a mess,"" said Michael Bilaniuk, a tourist from Ontario, Canada who said he had come straight to the Champs Elysees to check out the scene after arriving in France, aware that the Gilets Jaunes had been on the rampage.""It's almost part of the tourist attraction -- we've heard and seen so much about the protests, you kind of want to come and see for yourself what's happened. It's interesting.""Nearby, protesters' slogans were written across a storefront and the elegant entranceway to a gallery of shops.""They have millions, we are the millions"" read one. Another threatened: ""We are a legion, you are pawns, be careful.""""PROTEST TOO FAR""Since the 'yellow vest' movement began in November, originally as a protest against fuel taxes before morphing into a general denunciation of Macron's politics, the government has struggled to neutralize the threat. While there has been a protest every Saturday in Paris and other cities since November, not all of them have been as violent and destructive as Saturday's, which has made it hard for businesses to predict how to prepare. While some retailers began boarding up their shops after rioting in early December, in recent weeks the numbers joining the protests declined sharply and many storeowners may have thought it was safe to operate normally again.France's overall retail sales were affected at the end of 2018 because of nationwide disruption in the run-up to Christmas, and after Saturday's vandalism, Paris' Chamber of Commerce called for action from the government.""Employers and their staff have been traumatized by the intensity and repetition of the violence,"" the chamber said in a statement on Monday, pointing out that more than 90 businesses had been affected.""Last Saturday's demonstrations have taken things too far,"" it said, demanding that the government take ""firm measures that will allow retailers to go about their business normally"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Valtteri drove an incredible race today so he deserved it.""I've just got work on my starts more.""For Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), however, it was a sobering day as fourth-placed Vettel and fifth-placed new boy Charles Leclerc were reduced to fighting each other for a minor position.The Scuderia had posted the fastest times during winter testing -- just pipping Mercedes -- but both cars finished nearly a minute behind Bottas.Four-times champion Vettel held the podium spot for most of the race but ended up easily picked off by Verstappen as Red Bull celebrated a positive debut with Honda engines.""I had to overtake Seb to get onto the podium which is not easy here but I was happy to pull that move off,"" said the Dutchman, who secured Honda a first podium in the V6 turbo hybrid era.In the midfield battle, Kevin Magnussen was sixth for Haas ahead of Renault's seventh-placed Nico Hulkenberg.Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen was eighth in his debut for Alfa Romeo, the team formerly known as Sauber, while ninth-placed Lance Stroll and 10th-placed Daniil Kvyat grabbed the remaining points for Racing Point F1 and Toro Rosso respectively.It was a terrible  Renault  (PA:RENA) debut for home hope Daniel Ricciardo as he rolled wide into the grass straight out of the grid and destroyed his front wing over a bump.He was forced to pit immediately to replace it and ended up back in the garage midway through the race, his third retirement in his home race.McLaren driver Carlos Sainz also retired after easing into pit lane on the 11th lap with his car on fire.Haas, who lost both cars due to botched tyre changes in last year's race, showed they were not free of their pit-stop gremlins, as a poor stop caused Romain Grosjean to lose two places.The Frenchman was later forced to retire with a reliability problem.In his first Formula One race in more than eight years, Williams (NYSE:WMB) driver Robert Kubica was last of the 17 cars that finished, one behind rookie team mate George Russell.McLaren's Lando Norris was the best of the F1 debutants, finishing 12th.Prior to the start, drivers and officials stood for a minute's silence at the grid in tribute to the late F1 racing director Charlie Whiting and in remembrance of victims of a mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We were hoping to be where we are ... Valtteri did an exceptional job out there, it was very close.""Hamilton matched Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher for the record number of poles at a single race track.Senna took his eight at Imola, with Schumacher dominating the Suzuka circuit.Four-times champion Vettel, bidding for a third successive win at Albert Park, was separated from his new team mate Charles Leclerc by fourth placed Max Verstappen of Red Bull.It would have felt like 'deja vu' for Ferrari, having trailed Mercedes by nearly seven-tenths of a second in qualifying at last year's race.""Certainly Mercedes are the clear favorite,"" Vettel told reporters with a touch of resignation.""I'm certainly surprised (by their pace), I think everybody is, probably even themselves.""While Verstappen's pace was encouraging for Red Bull on the debut of their Honda partnership, Toro Rosso graduate Pierre Gasly was eliminated in Q1 and will start 17th on the grid. Renault  (PA:RENA), meanwhile, had a bigger reality check, with neither of their cars able to reach Q3.Their expensive new recruit Daniel Ricciardo, who transferred from Red Bull in the off-season, qualified 12th behind his 11th-placed team mate Nico Hulkenberg.It was a joyful day for the youngest man on the track as 19-year-old Briton Lando Norris qualified eighth behind the two Haas cars in a boost for McLaren.The debutant outshone his senior team mate Carlos Sainz who will start 18th, having been knocked out in Q1 and blocked during his last flying lap by Williams (NYSE:WMB) driver Robert Kubica.Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen, 20 years Norris's senior, will also start one behind the Briton despite a solid debut for Alfa Romeo, the team formerly known as Sauber.Toro Rosso's Anglo-Thai debutant Alexander Albon made it through Q1 to secure 13th on the grid in an encouraging start.Kubica's first F1 qualifying in over eight years was forgettable. He suffered a right rear puncture and ended up skidding over the grass on his final effort in Q1.The Pole will line up last on the grid behind his 19th-placed rookie team mate George Russell, the Williams team proving well off the pace after their off-season troubles.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

From what we have learned so far, this year will be even tougher,"" he added.""Judging from the performance in Barcelona (testing), it looks like we will have a proper fight on our hands in Melbourne.""If Hamilton, winner of four of the last five championships, is feeling the pressure the Briton is doing well to conceal it.A day before arriving Down Under on Monday, the 34-year-old indulged his new sky-diving hobby, jumping out of a plane over the Qatar desert.Having won 11 of 21 races last season, another F1 title would put Hamilton one shy of Michael Schumacher's record of seven and stir the debate about the greatest racer of all time.The pressure is arguably heavier on the shoulders of German rival Sebastian Vettel, who won just five races last year and saw his challenge evaporate with a string of mistakes on track.The four-times champion will bid for a third successive win at Albert Park's season-opener, having foiled pole-sitter Hamilton amid a virtual safety car deployment last year.""I feel Melbourne is the perfect place to start the championship,"" said the 31-year-old German, now in his fifth season with the glamor team.""I’ve got great memories of this track.""With 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen having switched to Alfa Romeo, the team formerly known as Sauber, Vettel's new partnership with highly-rated Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc will be under scrutiny.The 21-year-old Leclerc, Ferrari's youngest race driver since 1961, is one of a number of tyros seeking to make an early impression in Australia.Max Verstappen, who at 17 was the youngest driver ever to start a race, is now a 21-year-old ""veteran"" in his fifth season and the main man at Red Bull, who also have 23-year-old Frenchman Pierre Gasly racing for them.Red Bull, the best of the rest behind Mercedes and Ferrari last season, have ambitions of higher honors after partnering up with Honda engines.The team said on Tuesday it had expedited an upgrade for the RB15 car in time for Sunday's race, a month earlier than scheduled.""Our optimism is not unfounded,"" said Red Bull motorsport consultant Helmut Marko.""I see us behind Ferrari over the race distance but ahead of Mercedes.""Daniel Ricciardo will also hope for better luck at his home race in the yellow and black of  Renault  (PA:RENA), having missed a maiden podium in Melbourne with Red Bull last year when he was hit with a three-place grid penalty for a minor technical infringement.It will also be an emotional weekend for Pole Robert Kubica, who reboots his F1 career with the struggling Williams (NYSE:WMB) team eight years after being seriously injured in a rally car accident.At a bumpy street circuit where overtaking has been difficult, F1 bosses will hope the introduction of new rules can inject spice.The cars feature new front and rear wings, aimed at making it easier for them to get closer and overtake, while the driver that sets the fastest lap can earn an additional championship point, so long as he finishes in the top 10 in Sunday's race.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nissan has said that Ghosn wielded too much power, creating a lack of oversight and corporate governance. It was not clear who would become Nissan's chairman, vacant since Ghosn was arrested in Japan in November.But the automakers gave no indication of any immediate change in their cross-shareholding agreement, one which has given smaller Renault SA (PA:RENA) more sway over Nissan. The so-called Restated Alliance Master Agreement that has bound them together so far remains intact, they said.""We are fostering a new start of the alliance. There is nothing to do with the shareholdings and the cross-shareholdings that are still there and still in place,"" Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said at a news conference. ""Our future lies in the efficiency of this alliance,"" he told reporters at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama.Senard also said he would not seek to be chairman of Nissan, but instead was a ""natural candidate"" to be vice-chairman.Former Nissan chairman Ghosn was released on a $9 million bail last week after spending more than 100 days in a Tokyo detention center. He faces charges of under-reporting his salary at the Japanese automaker by about $82 million over nearly a decade - charges he has called ""meritless"". Ghosn, who has not spoken to media since his release, put in a request with a Tokyo court on Monday to attend Nissan's board meeting the next day, but he was not given permission. Under the terms of his bail, he would have needed the court's nod to attend.BOARD MEETINGGhosn will not hold a highly anticipated news conference until next week at the earliest and is not planning to attend Nissan's shareholder meeting next month, his lawyer said. ""Mr Ghosn wants to have some time to mull over what he's going to say,"" Junichiro Hironaka told reporters outside his Tokyo office after meeting with Ghosn throughout the day.Ghosn left his lawyer's office in the evening without taking questions from reporters.In the wake of the scandal, Renault has started its own review of payments to Ghosn. French prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into how he financed his 2016 wedding at the Chateau de Versailles, French media have reported.His dramatic arrest and the detention exposed tensions between Nissan and top shareholder Renault, complicating the outlook for a partnership that is the world's largest maker of automobiles, excluding heavy trucks.Some at Nissan had been unhappy with Ghosn's push for a deeper tie-up with Renault, which was seen as possibly including a full merger.

It established in its own investigation that a 2016 Renault sponsorship deal with the Chateau de Versailles outside Paris included a 50,000 euro ($56,000) personal benefit to Ghosn, and said it would alert prosecutors. The prosecutor's office in Nanterre near Paris, which the reports said was handling the investigation, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ghosn was ousted as the head of Nissan and later removed as Renault CEO after his arrest in Japan last November over allegations of financial misconduct linked to his salary. He was released on a $9 million bail only last week.In the wake of the scandal, Renault began its own review of payments to Ghosn. The former executive has denied any wrongdoing associated with the wedding. ""The event space at Versailles was made available to him without charge, and Mr Ghosn was unaware that the use of the space would be charged against Renault's allotted usage,"" his French-based lawyer Jean-Yves Leborgne said in February when the allegations came to light, adding that Ghosn had paid for all of his wedding expenses. Renault declined to comment on Monday. The carmaker had agreed before the wedding to sponsor 2.3 million euros of renovations at the historic Versailles palace in return for a credit granting it services from the chateau worth 25 percent of that amount, or 575,000 euros, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The rental fee was deducted from Renault's credit for use of the Grand Trianon building at Versailles on Oct. 8, 2016, when Ghosn and his second wife, Carole, hosted their wedding reception, the source said. The event had already attracted public attention for its opulence and Marie Antoinette-themed costumes.($1 = 0.8894 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He managed to avoid many of the reporters camped at the site before being whisked away in a small Suzuki van.Ghosn paid the 1 billion yen ($9 million) bail, among the highest ever in Japan, after the Tokyo District Court rejected a last-ditch appeal by prosecutors to keep him in jail. Ghosn, also the former chairman of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors, has agreed to strict bail conditions and given assurances he will remain in Tokyo, surrender his passport to his lawyer and submit to extensive surveillance.He has agreed to set up cameras at the entrances and exits to his residence, and is prohibited from using the internet or sending and receiving text messages. Ghosn is also banned from communicating with parties involved in his case, and permitted computer access only at his lawyer's office.He faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his salary by about $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade. If convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum jail sentence of 15 years, prosecutors have said.""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday.The finance minister of France welcomed Ghosn's release, saying the executive would now be able to defend himself ""with greater ease"". Ghosn holds a French citizenship.BUILDING DEFENSEThe release will allow Ghosn - the architect of Nissan's automaking partnership with Renault and Mitsubishi - to meet his new legal team more frequently and build a defense ahead of trial, which could be several months away.Last month, Ghosn hired lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, nicknamed ""the Razor"" for his success at winning acquittals in several high-profile cases, to replace Motonari Otsuru who once ran the prosecutor's office investigating him.Hironaka's appointment suggests a shift to a more aggressive defense strategy. He has already said that the charges against Ghosn should have been dealt as an internal company matter and that Japan was out of step with international norms by keeping his client in jail.The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.While the bail is a significant step, Ghosn still faces a criminal justice system with a conviction rate of 99.9 percent. Credited with reviving Nissan in the early 2000s, Ghosn was one of the auto industry's most powerful figures as head of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, whose combined sales rank it as one of the world's biggest automakers.At the time of his arrest, he had been seeking a full merger of the companies, an idea opposed by many Nissan executives.However, his arrest has since muddied the outlook for the alliance, which is based on a web of cross-shareholding and operational integration.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

207,"Mar 05, 2019 11:03AM ET",Ousted Nissan boss Ghosn to leave prison after court rejects prosecutors' appeal,nan,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Maki ShirakiTOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese court on Tuesday rejected a last-minute attempt by prosecutors to keep former Nissan Motor Chairman Carlos Ghosn in prison, ruling that the once-feted executive could be released on $8.9 million bail after more than 100 days in detention.The Tokyo District Court, which had earlier granted Ghosn bail, said it had rejected an appeal by prosecutors who had sought to keep him in prison, pending his trial for financial misconduct.The decision paves the way for Ghosn's release as early as Wednesday and marks a victory for his new legal team, brought in last month and spearheaded by a lawyer known as ""the Razor"" for his success in several high-profile cases.On what was Ghosn's third bail request, the court accepted defense lawyers' assurances that he would submit to extensive surveillance.The release would allow Ghosn - the architect of Nissan's automaking partnership with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and one of the industry's most celebrated executives - to meet his lawyers frequently and build a defense ahead of his trial.Ghosn faces charges of aggravated breach of trust and under-reporting his compensation to the tune of $82 million at Nissan for nearly a decade.If convicted on all the charges, he faces up to a decade in jail. The ex-chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors has denied wrongdoing and late on Tuesday reiterated his position.""I am extremely grateful for my family and friends who have stood by me throughout this terrible ordeal,"" Ghosn said in a statement.""I am innocent and totally committed to vigorously defending myself in a fair trial against these meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.""Nissan declined to comment on the bail decision, which comes a day after the head of Ghosn's new legal team said he was optimistic the executive would be released with a promise to submit to surveillance.The case has cast a harsh light on Japan's criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Public opinion is likely to have played a role in the court's bail decision, said Shin Ushijima, a former prosecutor and lawyer.""The court was partly influenced by the opinion of the entire world,"" Ushijima said. ""People in general thought (the detention period) is too long. This will change Japan's criminal procedures.""$9 MLN BAILThere was a heavy media presence earlier on Tuesday outside the Tokyo detention center where Ghosn is being held, with throngs of reporters setting up ladders to gain a clear view over the tall fence. A helicopter briefly buzzed overhead.While Ghosn's 1 billion yen ($9 million) bail would rank among the highest in Japan, it is half the amount paid in 2005 by Mitsuru Asada, a businessman who was later convicted of defrauding the government through a beef buyback program.Ghosn, who turns 65 on Saturday, has spent more than 100 days in a 4.8 square meter (52 sq ft) cell. In his only court appearance, in January, he said he looked forward to his trial to ""finally have the opportunity to defend myself"".In an interview later with Japan's Nikkei newspaper, Ghosn said that Nissan executives opposed to his plans for closer ties with Renault were behind the allegations against him.The appointment last month of lawyer Junichiro Hironaka, who earned his nickname for his combative style, was widely seen as a move to adopt a more aggressive legal strategy with Ghosn's defense.Hironaka has argued that the allegations should have been resolved as an internal company matter and blasted the judicial system for keeping his client in jail.Ghosn's France-based lawyers on Monday said that they had complained to the United Nations that their client's rights had been violated during his detention in Japan.Though the granting of bail represents a significant development, Ghosn still faces a criminal justice system in which only three of every 100 defendants who plead not guilty are acquitted.There is also no plea-bargaining mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence."
208,"Mar 05, 2019 06:15AM ET",Dueling superminis distract from auto industry troubles,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumeGENEVA (Reuters) - Two of Europe's best-selling cars, the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Clio and Peugeot 208, go head-to-head at the Geneva motor show on Tuesday, as the auto market they dominate faces transformative pressures on its future profits and jobs.As industry executives gather to discuss trade-tariff threats, new emissions rules and fines, or waning ambitions for autonomous driving, the two staple subcompacts will be wheeled out in apparent defiance of the profound changes underway.In other ways, though, they show an industry fast adapting. Both models are poised to abandon what remains of their French production, completing a once controversial shift to lower-cost plants in Turkey, eastern Europe and Morocco. Both will also introduce electric and hybrid drivetrain options - which themselves pose a further challenge to supplier jobs https://reut.rs/2wrsoPT.""There’s an ongoing need for compact, efficient urban models,” said Jean-Philippe Imparato, head of the Peugeot brand. “The market is robust.”Small certainties are welcome in an industry facing hard-to-quantify strains including Britain's planned exit from the European Union, a U.S.-led assault on trade liberalization and the many billions spent developing a new generation of electric vehicles for which mass demand remains largely unproven.Major auto markets are now in decline or stagnating, and hopes for a lucrative self-driving car boom have also receded as costs and technical hurdles stay stubbornly high.While higher-riding SUVs are on a relative upswing, compact hatchbacks such as the Clio and 208 are still Europe's biggest vehicle category by volume, accounting for 3.5 million annual sales for an 18 percent market share.“There’s plenty of room for both” cars and SUVs in Europe’s small-car market, said Denis Schemoul, an auto production analyst with forecaster IHS Markit. “The small hatch remains an excellent compromise in terms of size and versatility.”LOWER STANCEBoth the 208 and the Clio, which has notched up 15 million vehicle sales since its 1990 debut, deliberately shun modish bulk in their latest incarnations, for a lower, more aerodynamic stance that can only help fuel-economy.Carmakers risk hundreds of millions of euros in fines for missing the EU's 2020-21 emissions goal averaging 95 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometer. The bloc's parliament and member states have agreed on a further 37.5 percent cut by 2030. According to new industry data published on the eve of the show, European new-car CO2 emissions actually rose in 2018 for a second consecutive year, as sales of relatively efficient diesels continued to collapse.“Instead of moving forwards, the industry is regressing at a time when emissions targets are getting tougher,” said analyst Felipe Munoz of consulting firm JATO, which compiled the data.PSA Group’s Peugeot and Citroen line-ups came in below 108 grammes of average CO2 emissions last year – just behind hybrid leader Toyota’s 99.9 grammes – while the Opel division acquired from General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2017 topped 125 grammes. Fourth-placed Renault averaged 109.1 grammes.Strong sales of the new 208 will not be enough to avoid the early retirement of some Opel models before the new rules take effect, a PSA source told Reuters. “Expect some announcements later this year.”With its lower, wider, longer 208, Peugeot has adopted the lighting signature and other design cues from its 3008 and 5008 SUV siblings, whose runaway success has lifted pricing power and driven PSA Group to record profits.JOBS SHIFTAssembly of the 208 will end at the group’s Poissy plant west of Paris, which had handled overflow production of the current model built mainly in Trnava, Slovakia. The new vehicle will also be produced in Kenitra, Morocco, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.Renault’s Flins plant is similarly unlikely to keep the Clio as the model upgrades, industry sources said. The factory now has a growing output of Zoe electric cars and alliance partner Nissan’s Micra to keep its lines humming and unions happy.A new affordable Renault hybrid drivetrain will launch in the Clio next year, as Peugeot debuts its pure-electric 208 – both part of the industry's scramble to electrify, cut emissions and avoid fines.But the abrupt shift from combustion engines to batteries, which can account for 40 percent of the final price of a car, has sparked fears and warnings about the fallout for jobs in Europe, which lacks battery makers to compete with Chinese, South Korean and Japanese groups.To avoid ""ruinous"" fines, PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview with Le Figaro on Monday that carmakers were forced to ""reserve battery volumes with Asian suppliers who only are happy to see us coming"" and extract high prices.""The European Parliament's decision is quite simply forcing the auto sector to export 40 percent of its vehicles' value to Asia,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We want to get a sense of this market again because this is very much about data. You can access the data to service the car,"" she said.Renault, Jaguar Land Rover, Peugeot and other carmakers have increased revenues by more than $1 billion in the past decade by using sophisticated pricing software, sales presentations prepared by Accenture and other documents filed in a court case have shown.The software works by identifying which spare parts in a manufacturer's range customers would be content to pay more for, how much to raise prices by and which prices should not be hiked, Accenture told prospective clients.Accenture has denied its software was unfair to motorists and said its focus was on increasing efficiency for its clients.Renault, Jaguar Land Rover and Peugeot said their pricing strategies for spare parts were legal, did not take advantage of car owners and were focused on efficiency and ensuring availability for motorists.France's competition regulator said last year it had examined the software and did not see a reason to open a full antitrust investigation, without explaining its thinking.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He also has been charged with aggravated breach of trust.The ex-chairman of Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has denied wrongdoing.""I believe it's possible he could be released in the near future,"" Hironaka said in a more optimistic outlook than former lead lawyer and one-time chief prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, who had suggested Ghosn could remain in custody in Japan for months.""We haven't known each other for long but I hope to build up a relationship of trust,"" said Hironaka, who acknowledged a language barrier with his client but added that he had read books authored by Ghosn to get to know his client better.Ghosn and his legal team are currently waiting for the Tokyo court to decide whether to grant his third request for bail submitted late last week.This time, Ghosn has said he is willing to submit to severe restrictions including video surveillance and communications monitoring to secure freedom before his trial, Hironaka said. His previous offer to hire security guards and wear an ankle monitoring bracelet failed to convince judges who cited a risk of evidence tampering when they rejected two previous bail applications.Meanwhile, the defense team has begun holding pre-trial discovery meetings with prosecutors and judges to review evidence and submit lists of witnesses to be presented at trial, Hironaka said, a process which could take several months.RAZOR SHARPThe appointment of Hironaka, nicknamed for his combative style, is widely seen as move to adopt a more aggressive legal strategy.""I am now 73 years old, but I want to test how sharp my razor still is,"" Hironaka told reporters, without revealing details of the legal strategy he and is colleagues will pursue.Since taking over Ghosn's defense team, Hironaka has argued the allegations should have been resolved as an internal company matter without the involvement of prosecutors, and blasted the judicial system for keeping his client in jail.The former Nissan boss faces a criminal justice system where only three of every hundred defendants pleading not guilty are acquitted.

212,"Feb 27, 2019 05:20AM ET",Air France-KLM Tumbles Most Since Merger on Surprise Dutch Stake,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Air France-KLM Group fell the most ever after the Dutch government’s surprise decision to buy a stake in the airline raised concern that competing national interests will derail Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith’s efforts to streamline the carrier.The Netherlands purchased a 13 percent holding, a move aimed at gaining parity with influential shareholder France following a power clash that left the Dutch side of the partnership weakened. The stock dropped as much as 15 percent in Paris, the most since 2002, when it was just Air France. The current company was created two years later when the French flag carrier merged with its smaller Dutch counterpart.“The Dutch stake does not make us more positive,” Bernstein analysts including Daniel Roeska said in note Wednesday. “We worry that national, diverging interests will slow the group down in its much-needed restructuring.”KLM and Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam are of great importance to the economy and employment, Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra told reporters late Tuesday after announcing the investment. He said the government was concerned that decisions on KLM’s strategy more frequently were being made at the level of Air France-KLM’s Paris-based holding company.“There was simply too little influence from the state in KLM to be able to look after the Dutch public interest well, and to make a success of KLM,” Hoekstra said. “This step shows our long-term commitment to the entire company.”The shares traded 12 percent lower at 11.24 euros at 11:13 a.m. in Paris, giving Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) a market value of 4.82 billion euros ($5.5 billion).New TwistThe move reignites tensions between the French and Dutch arms of Air France-KLM, just as pressure was easing from a crisis that threatened the job of KLM boss Pieter Elbers. The Dutch head stayed, but Smith gained a seat on KLM’s supervisory board and won a more streamlined power structure that sidelined some of the cumbersome committees that slowed decision making but ensured the Dutch side had some parity.Hoekstra said the Dutch government, which held a 5.9 percent in the local KLM unit before the recent transactions, wants to reach parity with France, which holds a 14 percent stake in the holding company and as a long-term investor has extra voting rights that give it 23 percent of the vote.The Netherlands’ group-level stake, which cost 680 million euros, will put the state in a position to ask for board seats at the next general meeting. It won’t qualify for extra voting rights for two years.Air France-KLM’s board and the French government weren’t informed of the Dutch purchase in advance, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Les Echos on Tuesday. He said he reaffirmed his support for Air France-KLM management and said it is “essential to respect the principles of good government” without national interference.Dutch RevoltThe threat of Elbers’ departure had triggered an outpouring of support in the Netherlands, where Hoekstra touted his achievements and hundreds of KLM employees demonstrated outside the headquarters to defend their boss. KLM went as far as hiring a public affairs adviser in Paris and launching the #BlueStormRising hashtag to support Elbers. Although Smith -- a Canadian brought in to ease strife among labor and the various stakeholders -- eventually decided to renew Elbers’ mandate, the tensions deepened the rift between the two partners.Air France and KLM have been operating semi-independently since their merger through a complex arrangement that was meant to guarantee the Dutch government would keep a say in the companies and KLM would keep jobs and business in Amsterdam.Smith, who took over in September after Elbers refused the job, has made clear he wants the units to operate more like a single company, a move that has been met with resistance from KLM managers and unions who say they fear Air France’s lower profits will drag down their company.Emerging NationalismEuropean governments have intervened more frequently recently in the affairs of major businesses -- countering a 40-year trend toward privatization -- in an effort to protect local champions and respond to the increasingly nationalistic trade policies of the world’s dominant economies, China and the U.S.The French and German governments lobbied hard to save the rail merger of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA and Siemens AG’s train unit, which was blocked by the EU. Germany is also looking to orchestrate a merger to keep  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) out of foreign hands, and France is looking to delist nuclear power company Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF). In Italy, the government is increasing its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA and bankrupt airline Alitalia.For French President Emmanuel Macron, this is the second instance of an unexpected and not-so-friendly move on a French state-held company, after  Renault  (PA:RENA) leader Carlos Ghosn’s arrest in November in Japan. The French president, who has had a rocky start in his relationship with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, is discovering that another European leader can make a move straight out of the dirigiste playbook of Old France, sharpened into an art form by Louis XIV’s finance minster Jean-Baptiste Colbert in the 1600s.“The Dutch state seems to be implementing the same methods as the French,” said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management. “The perception of this all is that there is no choice to have an influence over what is seen as strategic assets but to own parts or all of these assets.""(Updates share prices from first paragraph.)"

However, we still have to keep on digging deep, analyzing the data and the changes that we are making,"" commented Hamilton. ""The reliability has been really solid which is a great showing of all the hard work that everyone in the factory has done.""Ferrari's Leclerc was sixth on harder tyres than any of those above him.Alfa Romeo's Italian Antonio Giovinazzi did the most laps of all on Thursday (154), but also twice brought out the red flags, while British rookie George Russell managed the fewest (17) in the Williams (NYSE:WMB).

214,"Feb 20, 2019 05:29AM ET","Ghosn's new lawyer, 'the Razor', takes aim at Nissan and prosecutors",nan,"By Tim KellyTOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's new lawyer took aim at Nissan, prosecutors and courts on Wednesday, dismissing the charges against the ousted chairman as an internal company matter and saying Japan was out of step with international norms by keeping his client in jail. ""This should have been dealt with as an internal matter,"" Junichiro Hironaka, nicknamed the Razor, said at his first press briefing. Ghosn, who was arrested in November over alleged financial misconduct and remains in detention in a Tokyo jail, picked a new team last week with long-time defense attorney Hironaka as a key member to replace Motonari Otsuru, a lawyer who once ran the prosecutor's office investigating him.Hironaka's combative style contrasts with the low-key approach adopted by a media-shy Otsuru. Ghosn's switch to an aggressive legal strategy came after his attempts to win bail failed and just before lawyers were due to sit down with prosecutors and judges for the first time to hash out a schedule for pre-trial discovery meetings, where prosecutors will reveal evidence and submit a list of witnesses. Hironaka said he didn't know why Ghosn picked him, but added that Ghosn probably wanted an experienced criminal lawyer as the case moved toward trial. The 73-year-old defense attorney is reputed for winning high profile cases, including the acquittal of a senior lawmaker, Ichiro Ozawa, on financial misconduct charges. He also helped free a senior bureaucrat Atsuko Muraki who was jailed for four months on corruption charges fabricated by prosecutors. Yet, even with greater legal firepower the former Nissan Motor Co boss faces a criminal justice system where only three out of every hundred defendants pleading not guilty are acquitted. Neither does Japan have a plea deal mechanism that would allow Ghosn to agree to lesser charges for a lighter sentence.""The change in lawyers means a change in style, but the legal strategy will still be the same,"" I don’t think it increases Ghosn’s chance of an acquittal,” said Masashi Akita, a defense lawyer at Shin-Yu Law Office in Osaka, ahead of Wednesday's comments by Hironaka.Ghosn has lost his perch atop an automotive alliance trio of French car maker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Japanese automakers Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Attempts to win bail, including an offer to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and hire security guards to stop him trying to tamper with evidence, failed.Ghosn stands accused of underreporting compensation spanning eight years to the tune of $82 million. He also faces breach of trust charges that he shifted personal losses to Nissan and improperly steered $14.7 million to a Saudi Arabian businessman’s company to help him navigate the problem. Ghosn denies all the charges.""He is innocent of all the charges,"" Hironaka said. LEGAL GAMBITIn January, former attorney Otsuru outlined some of the defense arguments in a lengthy statement prepared when the former executive requested a court hearing about his detention. Ghosn took the step, rare in Japanese legal proceedings, to profess his innocence and challenge his imprisonment. That hearing could end up backfiring, according to some Japanese legal experts because it established a legal strategy before his lawyers had looked at evidence gathered by prosecutors. Critics of that approach include defense lawyer Takashi Takano, a new member of Ghosn's legal team who spoke to Reuters before he was hired. ""They have shown their hand. That is not something they should have be doing at that stage,"" Takano, who runs his own criminal law practice, said ahead of comments by Ghosn's new lawyer on Wednesday. ""It's like playing rock-paper-scissors and the defense lawyers lost.""""It is an unusual strategy,"" said Professor Colin Jones, a lawyer and expert in Japan's legal system at Doshisha University in Kyoto. ""There is no plus side to a client statement, all could be used as evidence,"" he added.Wrangling over witnesses and evidence during pretrial discovery could take as long as a year with a subsequent trial stretching through 2020, the legal experts said. Ghosn's best chance for bail may come about halfway through that process when evidence tampering concerns, the reason given by the court to keep him locked up, ease, they added.Hironaka said it was difficult to predict when Ghosn will be released. Hironaka and Takano will be joined by Hiroshi Kawatsu from Kasumigaseki Sogo Law Offices to defend Ghosn.""I have been called the Razor, but it is not a nickname I particularly like. I would rather be known as gentle Hironaka,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

215,"Feb 20, 2019 04:20AM ET",Governance panel opposed to Renault chairman being named Nissan head: sources,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - An external committee tasked by Nissan Motor Co to help improve corporate governance at the Japanese firm is opposed to the idea of Renault's chairman being appointed to lead Nissan's board, two people familiar with the matter said.As Nissan and  Renault  (PA:RENA) seek to repair their 20-year alliance in the wake of ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest, the selection of his successor at the Japanese firm remains a sensitive issue, and the latest consideration is likely to increase tensions between them.""This option would not be very welcome,"" one of the sources told Reuters, while another person familiar with the issue has said that such a move ""could create a conflict of interest"" as a single person will oversee both Nissan and Renault.They declined to be named as the discussions are private and the committee has not reached a decision on its recommendations.The committee, due to make recommendations next month on corporate governance including procedures for executive appointments and compensation, is also considering other alternatives, the people said.Those include appointing an external chairman and limiting the chairman's responsibilities largely to a liaison role with other alliance members. It is also looking at setting up a group of internal and external members which would nominate the chairman, audit the process and determine how much board members get paid, the people said.Nissan has vowed to break away from its current executive structure, a legacy of Ghosn who concurrently served as chairman of Renault, Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors, and CEO of Renault.Such attempts could stoke concerns at Renault and particularly the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder which has said that it would like to see the chairmanship of Renault and Nissan held by the same person.During a visit to Japan last week, Renault's newly appointed Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told reporters that it was not the time to discuss whether he would also take over as chairman of Nissan. He is expected to be named to Nissan's board, given Renault's 43 percent ownership of Nissan.Nissan said it was not in a position to comment on the ongoing deliberations of the committee.""The committee is independent from Nissan,"" a Nissan spokesman said. Since Ghosn's arrest in November, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has blasted the once feted executive for holding too much power in the company. After Renault rescued Nissan from near bankruptcy in 1999, Ghosn has spent the majority of his time at Nissan as CEO and chairman.The automaker accuses Ghosn of using company funds for personal purposes and making secret arrangements to receive additional compensation upon retirement, and that a lack of accountability facilitated such activity. Ghosn has denied the accusations.Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over larger Nissan, and Ghosn's push for a deeper tie-up between the automakers, including possibly a full merger, despite reservations at Nissan. The Japanese automaker holds a 15 percent, non-voting stake in the French firm.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

218,"Feb 18, 2019 06:22AM ET",Morocco looks to French as language of economic success,nan,"By Ahmed EljechtimiRABAT (Reuters) - Morocco's economy is getting lost in translation.With so many students dropping out of university because they don't speak French, the government has proposed reintroducing it as the language for teaching science, maths and technical subjects such as computer science in high schools.It also wants children to start learning French when they start school.The country’s official languages are Arabic and Amazigh, or Berber. Most people speak Moroccan Arabic – a mixture of Arabic and Amazigh infused with French and Spanish influences.In school, children are taught through Arabic although they don't use it outside the classroom. When they get to university, lessons switch to French, the language of the urban elite and the country’s former colonial masters. Confused? Many are.Two out of three people fail to complete their studies at public universities in Morocco, mainly because they don't speak French.The linguistic morass has stymied economic growth and exacerbated inequalities in the North African country, where one in four young people are unemployed and the average annual income runs at approximately $3,440 per person, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - less than a third of the world average.The plans to broaden the teaching of French go to the heart of Morocco’s national identity.They would overturn decades of Arabisation after independence from France in 1956 and have triggered a furor in parliament, where members of the Islamist PJD party, the senior partner in the coalition government, and the conservative Istiqlal party view them as a betrayal.The disagreement has delayed a vote on the changes.""Openness to the world should not be used as an excuse to impose the primacy of French,"" said Hassan Adili, a PJD lawmaker.Proponents say the changes reflect the reality that French reigns supreme in business, government and higher education, giving those who can afford to be privately schooled through French a huge advantage over the majority of the country's students.""In the Moroccan job market, mastery of French is indispensable. Those who do not have command of French are considered illiterate,"" said Hamid El Otmani, head of talent and training at the Confederation of Moroccan Employers.Even before parliament votes on the changes, Education Minister Said Amzazi has okayed the roll-out of French in some schools, declaring its use in teaching scientific subjects as an ""irreversible choice"".Like many Moroccan politicians, his children received a private education.""When decision-makers start sending their children to public schools, only then can we say that we have a successful education system,"" said Jamal Karimi Benchekroun of the co-ruling socialist PPS party.Amzazi did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Frustration over jobs and poverty has fueled periodic protests in Morocco, but the country has avoided the sort of instability suffered by other North African states, where pent-up anger has triggered uprisings and provided fertile ground for Islamist extremism.King Mohammed VI, the ultimate power in Morocco, has proven adept at introducing limited reforms in response to popular protest. He has spoken publicly about the need to teach foreign languages to students to reduce unemployment and has made the economy a top priority.Last year, he sacked the minister for finance after calling on the government to do more to boost investment.C’EST LA VIEProblems with language are not unique to Morocco. In neighboring Algeria, another former French colony, students are also schooled in Arabic only to be greeted ""en francais"" in university and the workplace.French's pre-eminence reflects Paris' continuing influence in the region. France is the biggest foreign direct investor in Morocco and large companies such as carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Peugeot employ tens of thousands of people.Privately-run universities such as the International University of Rabat (UIR) have courses geared toward high-growth industries such as aerospace and renewable energy and offer tuition in French and English.But a year at UIR can cost up to $10,000 in fees, way beyond the budget of most Moroccans. They go instead to non-fee paying public universities, where the abrupt transition to studying in French is frequently a burden for students and their lecturers.""Sometimes we find ourselves giving French language courses during economy classes,"" said Amine Dafir, economy professor at Hassan II University, a public institution in Mohamedia, near Casablanca.Hamid Farricha, 37, dropped out of his applied physics and computer science degree at Hassan II University during the first year. He dreamed of becoming an engineer but the language barrier meant he struggled to keep up.Trying to find Arabic translations for French scientific words was a drain on his time.He switched instead to studying mechanics at a vocational school. He still had to master French to get hired.""The biggest challenge after earning my diploma was writing a CV and sitting for job interviews in French,"" Farricha told Reuters.He got a job as a technician at a plant repairing car frames, paid below Morocco's minimum monthly salary of 2570 dirhams, or $270.Farricha was one of the lucky ones. Morocco's economy cannot absorb all the young people looking for work. Around 280,000 graduates entered the labor force last year but only 112,000 jobs were created.The unemployment rate for graduates is 17 percent, above the national rate of 9.8 percent, according to data from Morocco’s planning agency.Morocco's reliance on small and medium-sized companies which do not typically employ graduates, and austerity drives which have cut public sector jobs are part of the reason for the high rate of graduate unemployment.The education system is also failing to prepare students for work.In addition to high dropout rates, Moroccan students score badly compared to peers on international tests, and at university level, students oversubscribe to social science fields at the expense of technical subjects, according to an IMF report in late 2017. That means many don't have the skills employers are looking for when they graduate.Even for roles not requiring a degree, French is a must. On the French website of Morocco's job promotion agency, almost all employers were looking for French speakers, including for jobs as guards, waiters, cooks and drivers.Determined to get ahead, Farricha worked on his French while employed at the plant. He read newspapers and books in his spare time and gave himself a daily list of new expressions and vocabulary to learn.He went back to university in 2014 for a degree in French law and is studying for a masters in diplomacy and international arbitration.To meet his living costs, he teaches French to other students.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

219,"Feb 18, 2019 02:20AM ET",German Carmakers at Most Risk From Trump Tariffs,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- European carmakers’ share rally this year might hit a roadblock as a U.S. probe of auto imports raises the potential of new tariffs, with underperforming German manufacturers particularly at risk.U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross submitted a report to President Donald Trump on whether vehicles made abroad pose a national-security risk, according to a statement Sunday. Trump will have 90 days for any response and, if he says he’ll move forward with measures under Department of Commerce recommendations, another 15 days to act.U.S. government officials haven’t given any insights into the findings. At the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the idea that her country’s autos pose a threat to the U.S.Car producers’ and suppliers’ stocks in Europe have gained in 2019 -- with the Stoxx 600 automotive index jumping 9.6 percent -- amid optimism that the U.S.-Chinese talks will resolve a dispute hampering the industry worldwide. BMW AG and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG have lagged behind as the German companies grapple with weakening demand in their home region and China.Even with this year’s bounce, the industry still trades at a depressed valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 6.6 that’s by far the lowest among all the sectors in Europe. And the automotive gauge is down 24 percent from a year ago. That’s a little before Trump began tweeting threats to tax German makers’ vehicles, though he’d complained since mid-2017 about the cars’ presence on U.S. streets.While Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in July to hold off on new tariffs during discussions to resolve an American-European dispute, the U.S. leader’s repeated tweets may indicate he’s primed to add import fees especially targeted at cars from the bloc, according to analysts.“The risk that tariffs between Europe and the U.S. will come is rather high -- I would say slightly more than 50 percent,” Juergen Pieper, an analyst at Frankfurt-based Bankhaus Metzler, said in an email. “Trump seems to have a real problem with German cars.”The European Union estimated in June that a 25 percent tariff would add about 10,000 euros ($11,300) to the sticker price of a car made in the bloc and sold in the U.S., and would cut American purchases of vehicles and parts in half. The Munich-based IFO Institute’s Center for International Economics calculates that an import fee of that size would cut German car sales to the U.S. by almost 50 percent, or about 17 billion euros, eroding total auto exports by 7.7 percent.Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz brand and BMW, the world’s two biggest makers of luxury cars, and Volkswagen, the largest auto producer globally, have the most at stake from any U.S. trade penalties, even as they’ve reduced the need to bring in vehicles by building American plants. The U.S. is the second-largest market for both Mercedes-Benz Cars and BMW.France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and PSA Group, the owner of the Peugeot and Citroen marques, don’t sell vehicles in the U.S. PSA shares outperformed the European automotive benchmark in the past 12 months, while among carmakers with a U.S. presence, Daimler has posted the gauge’s worst decline.Car and component exports from the EU to the U.S. totaled $62.5 billion in 2017 while imports amounted to $17.7 billion, according to a Feb. 15 note by Bernd Weidensteiner, an economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). Germany accounted for $30.5 billion of the outbound figure, though only $8.5 billion of purchases from the U.S.Even as American imports have declined in recent years as manufacturers established significant U.S. production, the German surplus of $22 billion is “a particular thorn in the side of President Trump,” he said."
220,"Feb 16, 2019 10:20PM ET",Nissan panel to recommend outside director to chair board: Nikkei,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Nissan Motor governance committee will recommend the appointment of an external director as board chairman, a role distinct from company chairman, in a move to decentralize power at the top level, the Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday.Under Nissan's current corporate charter, the position of board chair is automatically appointed to head the company board, the Nikkei said citing a source. Former Chairman Carlos Ghosn had filled both roles prior to his arrest in November for under-reporting his salary for eight years.The issue of Nissan's chairmanship is now particularly important after the Japanese firm identified the concentration of power in one executive as one of the reasons Ghosn was able to carry out his alleged fiscal misconduct.Speculation has swirled about whether the newly appointed chairman of France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), Jean-Dominique Senard, would assume the chairmanship of the Japanese automaker.The Nikkei report comes after the governance committee said in a statement that the separation between operation and oversight was among topics discussed on Friday at the committee's third meeting since it was formed in December after Ghosn's arrest.The panel, comprising three Nissan external board directors and four third-party members, is scheduled to make recommendations to Nissan's board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection.A spokeswoman for the committee said it could not comment on potential recommendations before they are submitted to the Nissan board.

223,"Feb 14, 2019 03:53AM ET",Renault embarks on post-Ghosn era with lower profit goal,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) set a weaker full-year profit goal on Thursday, citing currency challenges and market uncertainties, as the French carmaker presented annual results without its recently ousted CEO Carlos Ghosn for the first time in 13 years.Under new leadership since Ghosn's forced resignation last month over financial misconduct allegations, Renault targeted profitability of ""around 6 percent"" in 2019, compared with a 6.3 percent operating margin recorded last year.Revenue and profit both declined as expected on the combined effect of currency setbacks, a withdrawal from Iran and a diesel sales collapse that hit engine production for Renault's alliance partner Nissan and affiliate Daimler.The results nonetheless met Renault's own targets, including revenue growth before currency effects and an operating margin above 6 percent, on the way to its mid-term objective to exceed 7 percent in 2022.""2018 was clearly a challenging year in which we faced expected as well as unexpected difficulties,"" new Chief Executive Thierry Bollore said, adding that the results ""demonstrate the group's resilience"".Renault shares, which have lost about one-third of their value over the past 12 months, were up 3.8 percent at 58.84 euros as of 0840 GMT.UNDER NEW MANAGEMENTBollore, formerly Ghosn's deputy, was promoted to CEO on Jan. 24, with outgoing  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard taking over the departed leader's role as chairman.Ghosn faces trial in Japan after a Nissan internal probe uncovered evidence of misconduct including failure to declare more than $80 million in deferred income - straining relations with 43.4 percent-owner Renault. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.Renault said on Wednesday it had blocked 30 million euros in deferred and severance pay to Ghosn, who had served as its CEO since 2005, and as chairman for almost a decade.Underscoring challenges to alliance cooperation, Renault's sales to Nissan and other partners fell by 946 million euros ($1.1 billion) in 2018, reflecting collapsing diesel demand. A further negative impact is expected this year, the company said.Nissan's contribution to Renault earnings came in at 1.51 billion euros, a 46 percent decline from 2017, when the Japanese carmaker's profit was inflated by one-off gains.Renault's own cost-saving efforts in purchasing and manufacturing contributed 421 million euros to profit, a 37 percent decline.Overall revenue fell 2.3 percent to 57.42 billion euros, while recurring operating profit dropped 6.3 percent to 3.61 billion. Net income amounted to 3.3 billion euros, down sharply from the 5.31 billion recorded in 2017, partly reflecting the exceptional year-earlier gain from Nissan.Excluding currency effects, revenue would have risen 2.5 percent, Renault said. Analysts had expected recurring operating profit of 3.52 billion euros on revenue of 58.1 billion, based on the median of 12 estimates from an Infront Data poll.The carmaker said it saw no need for any financial provisions in relation to the scandal and ongoing investigation into Ghosn's conduct and executive payments by Renault and the jointly owned Renault-Nissan BV alliance management company.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

224,"Feb 14, 2019 02:11AM ET","Not time yet to discuss Nissan chairmanship, Renault's Senard says",nan,"By Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - The new chairman of French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) on Thursday said it was not the time to discuss whether he would also take the helm of Nissan, as he arrived in Japan to reaffirm an alliance rocked by the arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.The comment from Jean-Dominique Senard, reported by Japanese media, appeared aimed at avoiding putting further strain on an alliance that some in Japan see as unequal. Senard's visit is the first by Renault's top brass since Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November over allegations of financial misconduct.The downfall of one of the world's best-known executives has stunned the global auto industry and heightened tension between Renault and Nissan Motor Co. Senard is expected to meet Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa during his two-day visit.Senard said it was not the time to discuss whether he would also assume the chairmanship of Nissan, and that he expected discussions to be amicable, Jiji news agency reported, without giving direct quotes.Senard was appointed chairman of the French automaker three weeks ago, and is also expected to be named to Nissan's board, given Renault's 43 percent stake in the Japanese firm. He is expected to visit Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama on Thursday and Friday to meet with board members and management teams.The visit is aimed as a friendly, introductory call, according to sources familiar with the matter. But tension has been building between the two sides, with Renault initially backing Ghosn until he was forced to resign as chairman and CEO last month.Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over Nissan - the Japanese automaker, in turn, holds a 15 percent, non-voting stake in Renault. A focus now will be on who becomes the next chairman of Nissan, a role previously held by Renault's chairman. Nissan has said one of the reasons Ghosn was able to carry out his alleged fiscal misconduct was a concentration of power in one executive.Ghosn denies wrongdoing. DRIVING FORCE""There are various topics to discuss, but my responsibility is to Nissan stakeholders, to employees and customers and shareholders other than Renault, and Mr. Senard is in the same position,"" Nissan's Saikawa told reporters on Thursday.""The main thing is to talk about the future responsibly."" Ghosn himself was the driving force in the alliance, which was sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy and enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Ghosn had been pushing for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite reservations at Nissan.Senard's appointment in late January helped quell a leadership debate which erupted after Nissan dismissed Ghosn immediately after his arrest while Renault had initially stuck by the executive, and has opened a path for Renault and Nissan re-examine the operations and structure of their alliance.Joining Renault from tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Senard is generally seen by Nissan as a welcome outsider who could provide more balance to the alliance, over which Nissan has said Ghosn held excessive control given his roles as chairman of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, along with being Renault CEO.Senard's meeting with Saikawa would be the second since they first met face-to-face late last month.Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said Senard would also meet executives at Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan holds a controlling stake. Meanwhile, Ghosn, in custody at a detention centre in Tokyo for nearly three months, on Wednesday replaced his chief attorney with a legal team headed by one of Japan's most fiery lawyers in a move seen as taking on a more aggressive strategy in fighting his charges, which he denies.Regardless of the tensions, however, analysts say the automakers need the alliance to compete better with rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp. Renault announced on Thursday that revenue and profit fell in 2018, hit by collapsing diesel sales, exchange-rate setbacks and a withdrawal from the Iranian market. Nissan earlier in the week said its annual profit will plumb six-year lows due to waning global sales and an ongoing slump in its U.S. operations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A Renault spokesman did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment.Ghosn, 64, was arrested in Japan and ousted as Nissan chairman last November and has since been indicted along with Nissan and a fellow director for failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional 2010-18 compensation that he had arranged to be paid later. Ghosn denies the deferred pay was illegal or required disclosure.The scandal, triggered by a Nissan internal investigation, initially strained ties with 43.4 percent-owner Renault as the French carmaker continued to back Ghosn until he was eventually forced to resign last month. Renault appointed new Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard on Jan. 24 and last week passed evidence to prosecutors that the company had paid part of Ghosn's 2016 Versailles wedding costs, in a first case of his suspected misconduct at the French carmaker.Ghosn's representatives say he was unaware the 50,000 euro rental had been charged to Renault and now plans to repay it. The proposal to scrap most of Ghosn's severance package was drawn up by Renault's remuneration committee and is unlikely to be rejected by the full board, the sources said.Left intact, his golden parachute could have been politically explosive in France, where President Macron is battling ""yellow vest"" street protests over low pay and inequality.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire had asked the government's lead board representative at Renault to ""ensure that Mr Ghosn's compensation is cut as much as possible"", a ministry official said on Wednesday.""We've always been against excessive pay,"" the official said.

He has denied the charges.The once-feted auto executive hired Hiroshi Kawatsu as head of a new defense team, his office said on Wednesday.Hironaka, 73, has won several high profile cases, helping acquit senior lawmaker Ichiro Ozawa and senior bureaucrat Atsuko Muraki.Hiring Hironaka would mean a more aggressive legal strategy, said Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor. Otsuru previously led the special prosecutors' office that is now handling Ghosn's case.""Otsuru was miscast. He worked at the heart of the special prosecutors office so he was not someone who was going to go after them aggressively,"" Gohara said. ""Hironaka is an experienced defense lawyer who has won a number of cases. He will mount a more thorough and aggressive defense.""Otsuru's office confirmed his resignation in a statement, but gave no reason for the move.

Go Kondo, Ghosn's third defense lawyer, was unavailable for comment.Ghosn released a short statement thanking Otsuru for his team's ""tireless and diligent work"", and called him a ""very capable and intelligent man and lawyer"".The sudden change in attorneys comes ahead of the expected start of informal meetings with prosecutors and judges to discuss pretrial preparations, an indication that there will be no new charges against Ghosn.""As we begin the trial phase, I have decided to engage Hironaka-sensei as my legal counsel,"" Ghosn said, using a honorific suffix. ""I look forward to defending myself vigorously, and this represents the beginning of the process of not only establishing my innocence but also shedding light on the circumstances that led to my unjust detention.""Ghosn, 64, told the Nikkei newspaper last month that Nissan executives opposed to his plans for closer ties with automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) plotted to remove him.Ghosn was widely credited with rescuing Nissan from near-bankruptcy after he was brought over to Japan in 1999 by Renault after the French automaker bought a chunk of Nissan.Since his arrest, Ghosn has resigned as chairman of Renault and been sacked as chief of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, the three-way alliance he once captained.The scandal has roiled the global car industry and created tension between Nissan and Renault.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa is scheduled to meet newly appointed Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard on Thursday in Japan as they look at ways to cement their partnership.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The scandal has roiled global auto markets and created tensions between Nissan and its automaking partner France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), raising concerns about the future of the companies that Ghosn wanted to integrate.The dour outlook indicates an urgent need for Nissan and Renault to strengthen their partnership, but ties have been strained since the Japanese automaker moved first to remove Ghosn as chairman after his Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo. Nissan wants to stabilize alliance operations, said CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who is scheduled to meet newly appointed Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard this week in Japan as they look at ways to cement their partnership.Ahead of that meeting, the Nissan CEO said he wanted both companies to better leverage their scale to be more competitive and efficient in areas including manufacturing and procurement, while respecting each others' autonomy. ""In the past few years there's been a lot of talk about 'convergence' of the two companies' operations,"" Saikawa said, referring to one of Ghosn's key aims for the alliance. ""While stabilizing our operations, we need to re-examine whether investments (towards convergence) are the most efficient.""This could mean a reassessment of the alliance's growth targets through 2022, Saikawa said at a briefing on Tuesday.Nissan, which is almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains junior in their shareholding structure. Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, whereas Nissan has just a 15-percent non-voting stake in Renault.Japan's second-biggest automaker projected an operating profit of 450 billion yen ($4 billion) for the year to March, down 22 percent from the previous year and 17 percent below an earlier forecast, hurt by a slowdown in global sales. This would be Nissan's lowest operating profit since 2013.(For an interactive chart on Nissan's operating profit, vehicle sales, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2POSji4) SALES TO SKIDNissan cut its annual global retail vehicle sales view by 5.5 percent and projected weaker sales in China, its biggest market, and the United States. Saikawa said Nissan will avoid trying to meet sales targets by using discounts, a strategy which has hurt its profitability in North America, the world's No. 2 auto market.""We were only able to meet 60 percent to 70 percent of our (global) target for the year to the third quarter,"" Saikawa said. ""If we are not careful about how we make up for that shortfall in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in similar situations we've seen in the past.""""So we want to raise our performance by improving the quality of sales,"" he added.Nissan expects to sell 5.6 million vehicles worldwide in the year to March, versus a previous target for 5.93 million. While it still sees sales growing in China, the world's top auto market, it trimmed its forecast for the country to 1.56 million units from 1.70 million units.In the United States, it now sees sales tumbling 8.6 percent on the year to 1.46 million units, from 1.55 million last year. (For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' vehicle sales in the U.S., China, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2RjnBuA)Nissan and its domestic rivals, including Toyota Motor Corp, have struggled with sluggish sales and falling profit in North America. Their margins have been squeezed as they resorted to steep discounts to drive up demand in a competitive U.S. market where sales have plateaued near record highs.While it has been able to repair some of its profits in North America as inventory reduction of older models enabled it to dial back on heavy U.S. discounting, falling demand will test Nissan's ability to be disciplined with its incentives.

Nissan said it had recognized around 9 billion yen ($84 million) in additional expenses linked to payments to Ghosn. This announcement comes after it was indicted alongside Ghosn with failing to disclose the compensation. While it is possible that a Japanese court could order Nissan to pay Ghosn that amount, Saikawa said it was ""unlikely"" the expense would be realized.This provision refers roughly to the amount Ghosn has been charged of under-reporting in his 2010-2018 salary at Nissan.Ghosn has denied all charges against him.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

235,"Feb 12, 2019 05:33AM ET",Few tears shed by French workers after Macron's Alstom dream is blocked,nan,"By Richard Lough and Gilbert ReilhacBELFORT, France (Reuters) - After four decades on the production line at French trainmaker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), Claude Gemino had little sympathy for Emmanuel Macron when Brussels scotched the French president's hopes of creating a European rail champion.For Gemino and many co-workers at Alstom's Belfort factory, Macron's support for the blocked merger with Germany's Siemens signaled a readiness to put shareholders ahead of jobs and protecting France's fragile manufacturing sector.But the European Commission's veto last week has raised doubts about the president's industrial strategy as he battles to quell unrest over inequality and a perception he is indifferent to the struggles of France's working class.The workers' disdain for Macron's industrial plan reflects a broader lower-class anger at the former investment banker's reforms designed to liberalize and invigorate France's heavily regulated economy. Violent ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests have convulsed France for the past three months and raised questions over whether the man dubbed the ""president of the rich"" by left-wingers can make France more competitive.""The order books are apparently pretty full. Management tells us we're covered for the next four or five years,"" Gemino, who joined Alstom as a teenage apprentice, said as he passed through the plant's turnstile. ""The future isn't so bleak.""Alstom and Siemens wanted to merge their train manufacturing businesses to compete more effectively against China's state-owned CRRC, the world's biggest trainmaker, at a time rail companies globally are looking to consolidate and reduce costs through economies of scale.Alstom's unions say the company, with booked orders of 40 billion euros ($45 billion), is strong enough to survive alone and they would prefer to take on China without German help.""There will always be a risk, but Alstom and Siemens are capable of looking after themselves, on their own, and of pushing back against China,"" said Olivier Kohler, an Alstom employee and member of the moderate CFDT union, France's largest.""Even if there was a merger, their prices would still be lower.""Asked if Alstom could compete globally alone, an official in Macron's office said: ""In the short term, yes. It's making money. The problem is the long term,"" they said.SHORT-TERM WINAt the foot of Belfort's imposing citadel stands a giant statue of a lion carved out of red sandstone, symbolizing the town's resistance against German forces during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870.Nowadays, it's Alstom's fate in the face of foreign competition that weighs heavily on the collective psyche of Belfort, a town of 50,000 near Germany and Switzerland where the iconic high-speed TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) is made. ""Alstom is part of the town's identity,"" said retired SNCF railworker Georges Pagnoncelle. ""But French industrial groups keep on being bought by foreign firms, and jobs keep disappearing from France."" Alstom's unions were worried that a merger with Siemens would lead to the bleeding of jobs in France, but acknowledged the European Commission's veto was only a short-term reprieve. The threat from China and trainmakers in other emerging economies such as South Korea will persist and future alliances cannot be ruled out. Frustrated by the rejection of the Siemens-Alstom deal, Paris and Berlin now want to loosen European competition rules to take a more global view.Unionized managers at Belfort said they understood why the French government might want to merge Alstom with Siemens, but maintained that any such move must be on a 50-50 footing, protect jobs and fit into a clearer long-term strategy.Under the terms of the proposal, the German conglomerate would have taken a stake of 50 percent plus a few shares in Alstom with an undertaking not to boost its holding above 50.5 percent in the first four years.Alstom workers said Siemens would have been left in the driving seat.""We need a political vision for French industry,"" said Andre Fages of the CFE-CGC union that represents management, stressing the need for investment in research and development. ""Our politicians say France needs a strong rail industry. But when they want to buy trains, they want them at Chinese prices.""MACRON CONUNDRUMAlstom was Belfort's biggest employer until 2014 when it sold its turbine manufacturing business to U.S. company  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). Two years later, the then-Socialist government threw a lifeline 630-million-euro order for TGVs it did not yet need to stop Alstom shutting down the Belfort production line.In a reflection of France's industrial decline, Alstom's TGV plant is now surrounded by towering structures bearing General Electric's logo. Across a rail track stand rows of violet-shuttered terraced dwellings that once housed Alstom workers.The town's mayor, Damien Meslot, said the trainmaker now employed just 480 workers in Belfort, one of a dozen Alstom sites across France.General Electric, which France fined last week for reneging on a commitment to create 1,000 jobs, has some 4,000 staff in Belfort.High labor costs, a lack of automation and insufficient investment in innovation have eroded French industrial competitiveness since the late 1990s, according to economists. France produces the same quality of products as Spain but at a labor cost that is 20 percent higher, said Patrick Artus, chief economist at French bank Natixis. He said French workers were only fractionally cheaper than German employees in terms of unit cost, but produced an inferior product.""I keep telling French politicians that we sell  Renault  (PA:RENA) cars with the wages of BMW workers,"" Artus said.France's weak competitiveness underscores the conundrum Macron faces as he searches for a way to take the sting out of the ""yellow vest"" rebellion.The anti-Macron protesters, many of whom are low-income blue-collar workers, have railed since November against Macron's reforms to liberalize the economy and create a better trained, more highly skilled and flexible labor force.There are signs the reforms are bearing fruit. The protesters, though, want more protection from foreign corporations, a higher minimum salary and more money in household coffers.Macron has already bolstered pay for the lowest earners this year. More increases would only weaken French competitiveness, and productivity still needs to rise, economists say. ""I don't see how Macron will get out of this crisis,"" Artus said.In Belfort's town hall, framed photographs of Alstom's factory adorn the office of the mayor, who is a member of the conservative opposition party Les Republicains.Meslot said Macron and the president's socialist predecessor, Francois Hollande, had abandoned French industry, putting shareholder dividends over long-term strategy. ""No one knows what will become of the Alstom Belfort plant. For the town's mayor, that's a worry,"" Meslot said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The once-feted executive, credited for turning around both Renault and Nissan, remains in detention as he awaits trial that could be several months away. He denies any wrongdoing.Speculation about the future capital structure of the Renault-Nissan partnership has been rife since the arrest of Ghosn, who had been exploring ways to make the alliance ""irreversible"" before his arrest.But Saikawa has argued it is not time to discuss the ideal structure of the alliance, although he has said he wants to work closely with Senard who will likely sit on Nissan's board.The automaking alliance has been underpinned by Renault's 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault. The French government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault.The head of Japan's industry ministry on Tuesday denied media reports that the government had been told by France that it could lower its stake in Nissan, Jiji news reported, echoing a similar denial by France's finance ministry last week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Ghosn remains in detention in Tokyo with limited opportunity to respond publicly to allegations against him.Renault had agreed before the wedding to sponsor 2.3 million euros of Versailles renovations in return for a credit granting the carmaker services from the chateau worth 25 percent of that amount, or 575,000 euros, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The rental fee was deducted from Renault's credit for use of the Grand Trianon at Versailles on Oct. 8, 2016, when Ghosn and his second wife Carole hosted their wedding reception at the 17th-century palace, the source said. The event had already attracted public attention for its opulence and Marie Antoinette-themed costumes.The Renault board was informed about the discovery on Wednesday, as reported by Le Figaro, the source added.($1 = 0.8813 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

245,"Feb 03, 2019 07:07PM ET",Nissan scraps plan to build new X-Trail model in Britain,nan,"By Costas PitasLONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Nissan has scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain and will produce it solely in Japan, warning two months before Brexit that uncertainty over Britain's departure was making it harder to plan for the future.Falling demand for diesel cars in Europe has forced Nissan to invest in other technologies and save costs. It cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland factory in the north of England, Britain's biggest car plant, last year as output slumped 11 percent, hit by levies and crackdowns on diesel. ""Nissan has increased its investments in new powertrains and technology for its future European vehicles,"" the firm said. ""Therefore the company has decided to optimize its investments in Europe by consolidating X-Trail production in Kyushu.""""While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,"" said Nissan Europe Chairman Gianluca de Ficchy.Britain's business minister Greg Clark said the announcement was a ""blow to the sector and the region."" Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29. Lawmakers last month rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, heightening fears of a disorderly no-deal Brexit and of new trade barriers. May said on Sunday she would seek a ""pragmatic solution"".In a letter to workers, de Ficchy said Nissan has a task force that reports to him and is ""considering all of the possible scenarios and the potential impact on the business.""Nissan builds roughly 30 percent of the country's 1.52 million cars and exports the vast majority to the continentIt said four months after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 that it would manufacture the new X-Trail in Britain - a major vote of confidence in the country and May, shortly after she took office. A source told Reuters at the time that Nissan received a letter from the government promising extra support in the event that Brexit hit the competitiveness of the Sunderland plant. According to the Sunday Times newspaper, ministers are now considering whether to withdraw a 60 million pounds ($78.46 million) package of support for the company.""This kind of support package to help in areas such as training and skills is typical across the industry. Clearly we will be reviewing it in the light of this decision,"" a government source told the newspaper. The new X-Trail could have created hundreds of jobs.The carmaker's planned investment in the next-generation Juke and Qashqai models, which was also announced in 2016, was unaffected, Nissan said on Sunday. The announcement came just two days after an EU-Japan free trade agreement kicked in, which includes the European Union's commitment to removing tariffs of 10 percent on imported Japanese cars.Many Japanese companies had long seen Britain as the gateway to Europe, after being encouraged to open factories in the country by former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Brexit has thrown that into doubt, prompting consternation in Tokyo. Sunday's announcement also came as the carmaker continues to deal with the fallout from the arrest of its former boss Carlos Ghosn, which has clouded the outlook for the automaking alliance between Nissan,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

247,"Feb 01, 2019 11:25AM ET",Renault-Nissan payments to political advisers draw scrutiny,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan is examining fees paid to consultants and political advisers including a serving European lawmaker, following Chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest and ouster from the helm of the carmaking alliance, two sources told Reuters.Past business relationships with French advisers and lobbyists are in focus as the carmakers embark on an independent audit of their Dutch-registered Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) holding that Nissan had long demanded and  Renault  (PA:RENA) initially resisted.The Japanese carmaker is concerned that use of shared RNBV funds lacked transparency and may not have served the company's interests as much as those of Renault, or Ghosn himself, the sources said.Strategic PR adviser Claudine Pons and security consultant Alain Bauer have already confirmed reports they were paid via the holding for their services after a scandal at Renault in 2011 that almost forced Ghosn out. The company was hoaxed into firing three innocent executives over false spying accusations.The alliance also hired former justice minister Rachida Dati as a legal adviser soon after she left the government of then-president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009 to stand for the European Parliament, according to the same two sources.RNBV's dealings with Dati were unknown to Nissan, which co-funds the holding, spokesman Travis Parman said, when approached for comment. ""Nissan is not aware of any such payments. We can't comment on specifics related to the joint audit,"" he said.There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Dati, who is the highest-profile recipient of an alliance contract to have come to light.When contacted by Reuters, she referred questions to her lawyer, Olivier Pardo. Pardo said Dati had been hired by RNBV in October 2009, four months after leaving Sarkozy's government, and retained until February 2013. He declined to comment on her remuneration.""It was a retainer agreement that complied with the rules applying to lawyers,"" Pardo said. ""It was a very broad and wide-ranging assignment, and since she is bound by professional secrecy I can't go into any more detail.""The decision to end her RNBV contract was taken in October 2012, according to Pardo, five months after Francois Hollande succeeded her former mentor as French president.Spending on advisers appeared in RNBV accounts as a single line for consultants' fees, which exceeded 20 million euros in 2015 but included no further details, sources have said.Renault declined to comment on the RNBV audit.Ghosn, who was forced to resign as Renault chairman and CEO last week, has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional Nissan compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later.Senior director Greg Kelly and the Japanese carmaker itself have also been indicted.Both men deny that the deferred pay deals were illegal or required disclosure. Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.The scandal has strained Nissan's 20-year-old partnership with 43.4 percent-owner Renault.Repairing the relationship is the biggest challenge facing Jean-Dominique Senard, who took over as Renault chairman last week, as Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore was promoted to chief executive.Nissan began pushing for an investigation into RNBV within hours of Ghosn's arrest, and formally proposed a joint audit on Dec. 19.But its calls were rebuffed by Renault under Bollore's leadership as interim CEO, several sources have told Reuters.Nissan stepped up pressure for a financial audit to be conducted independently of lawyers reporting to Mouna Sepehri, a senior executive close to Ghosn, following a Reuters report on Jan. 10 about her undisclosed pay, two people with knowledge of the matter said.Renault's board agreed to the audit the following week.Further management changes are now likely at Renault ""within a month or so"", a source close to Chairman Senard told Reuters.Mazars, the Paris-based audit firm selected last week to comb through RNBV's finances stretching back to its creation in 2002, is expected to complete its work by the end of February.($1 = 0.8736 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

253,"Jan 28, 2019 07:41AM ET",Nissan says it's target of SEC inquiry after report of probe on exec pay,nan,"By Ritsuko AndoTOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Monday it was the target of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry, widening a scandal involving the Japanese firm and its ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn over his alleged financial misconduct. Ghosn, first arrested on Nov. 19 in Japan, has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional Nissan compensation for 2010-2018 that he had arranged to be paid later. Ghosn, swiftly dismissed as Nissan chairman after the arrest, has denied wrongdoing.Nissan was also charged by Japanese prosecutors for under-reporting his pay, and has since pledged to overhaul its governance.Bloomberg earlier reported that the U.S. regulator was investigating the company's disclosures on executive pay.The report, citing sources, said the SEC is examining whether the company maintained adequate controls to prevent improper payments and whether lapses by Nissan violated U.S. securities law. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC also sent a request for information to Ghosn. A representative for Ghosn could not immediately be reached for comment.A Nissan spokesman confirmed the automaker received an inquiry from the U.S. regulator, without giving further details. The SEC was not immediately available to comment on the matter.Such an SEC inquiry does not mean that regulators have found any wrongdoing, but can lead to civil cases against companies and their employees, or they can end with no charges, sometimes months or years later.A three-year SEC investigation last year found that  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) failed to properly disclose around $3 million in perks for former CEO Andrew Liveries and the firm agreed to pay $1.75 million in settlement.In 2004, industrial giant  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) settled with the regulator over its failure to disclose former CEO Jack Welch's lavish retirement package.  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) also agreed that year to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million after it failed to properly disclose payments to its former senior chairman.Nissan has American Depository Receipts traded on the U.S. over-the-counter market, giving the United States authority to investigate it for potential wrongdoing. Other Japanese companies have been the target of SEC inquiries before, including Toyota Motor Corp over its handling of safety problems.The financial scandal involving Ghosn, one of the auto industry's most feted executives, has rocked the industry, clouded the future of Nissan and its alliance with French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) and raised questions about governance at Japan's second-largest automaker.Nissan set up a committee to examine the root cause of Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct and propose corporate governance reforms.The committee plans to make recommendations to Nissan's board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection.Nissan shares slipped 0.8 percent on Monday in Tokyo, versus a 0.6 percent decline in the Nikkei average.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

254,"Jan 27, 2019 10:20PM ET","Ghosn Jail Time Is `Too Long, Too Hard,' Macron Tells Japan",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- French President Emmanuel Macron told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he’s worried about Carlos Ghosn’s conditions in jail, making his strongest comments yet on the fallen car titan and the scandal that has rocked  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s decades-old alliance with Nissan Motor Co.“All I’ll say is that I felt the detention was too long and too hard, and I told Abe that,” Macron told reporters in Cairo, referring to a telephone conversation with Abe on Friday. “I’m just concerned that the case of a French citizen should respect basic decency.”Macron’s views follow days after Ghosn stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of France’s largest carmaker and two months after Nissan booted him out, with the attention shifting to the future of the partnership. While Renault named  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO Jean-Dominique Senard as its chairman last week, the French leader has reportedly suggested the executive be made Nissan’s chairman as well to help manage the alliance.With his public remarks on the case, Macron risks being seen as meddling in Japan’s justice system. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Monday that due process is being followed in Ghosn’s detention and investigation.“It is being carried out by highly independent investigative authorities, based on appropriate procedures and strict legal judgment, including the orders of the court,” Suga said. He also said the two carmakers should decide on who becomes Nissan’s chairman, pushing back on the idea of governments getting involved in the talks.Ghosn has been in custody since his Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo, indicted for allegedly understating his income at Nissan and transferring personal trading losses to the carmaker. He’s been denied bail repeatedly after prosecutors argued he’s a flight risk, while his lawyers say he could stay in custody until a trial that may be six months away. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing.Macron’s involvement in the affairs of the two companies is mainly because of the power the French state wields over Renault. The government owns 15 percent of Renault with extra voting rights, while the latter holds about 43 percent of Nissan with voting rights, giving French leaders indirect say in decisions that sometimes affect the Japanese carmaker.Nissan has a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault, which also appointed Thierry Bollore as its CEO.While both companies have repeatedly said they are committed to the partnership, Nissan has long been unhappy about what it considers an out-sized French role in the alliance, whose third member is Mitsubishi Motors Corp.“We will be diligent to ensure the stability of the group,” Macron said.Renault-Nissan alliance executives will meet this week in Amsterdam, where the company that manages the partnership is based, people familiar with the matter said. The meeting would be the first since Ghosn quit.In an unexpected twist, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, a former protege of Ghosn who led the campaign against his ex-boss, said he too intends to step down in coming months after reforming the poor governance he says weakened the Japanese carmaker. Nissan has also been indicted by prosecutors.Macron also has a history with Renault. On Sunday, he defended an increase in the French stake in 2015 on his watch as economy minister. It was a move that had rattled Nissan.“I was happy I intervened, because I felt that Ghosn had gone too far in the ‘Nipponization’ of the group,” he said.(Updates with Japan government comments in fourth paragraph. An earlier version of this story corrected the shareholding in the seventh paragraph.)"

He denies any wrongdoing.The scandal has strained Renault's alliance with Japan's Nissan, an industrial partnership Ghosn built into a global carmaking giant over two decades. France's CGT union has estimated Ghosn's severance package is worth 25-28 million euros ($28-32 million), in addition to an annual pension of 800,000 euros.Le Maire declined to say what he thought would be an acceptable pay-off for Ghosn, but said the government had previously succeeded in getting Ghosn's 2018 pay package reduced by 30 percent from his 2017 total of 7.4 million euros.The finance minister also said he would propose in the coming months legislation to require bosses of large companies based in France to make the country their tax domicile. The changes would target in particular big firms listed on the CAC-40 and SBF-120 indexes on the Paris stock market, along with groups in which the state has a holding, Le Maire said.The legislation would include sanctions for company chiefs that breached the rule, he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Stark, who is currently head of Procurement and Supplier Quality at Mercedes-Benz said the shift toward electric and connected cars has made it more dependent on battery cell chemistry and connected vehicles expertise from outside the company.""We will think about partnerships in some areas. The role of partnerships as a whole will gain in importance,"" Stark said during a news conference in Stuttgart to discuss the German carmaker's procurement strategy.Mercedes-Benz will rely more on its suppliers to take a leading role in the area of research and development as well as to identify cost-cutting potential through process optimization, Stark said.""We will intensify scouting of Chinese suppliers. China is more advanced than the United States in many areas of digital innovation,"" Stark said on Thursday. ""China will dramatically increase in importance,"" Stark said referring to the raft of suppliers that Mercedes-Benz does business with. China, a market where the luxury passenger car brand sold 674,125 cars last year, is setting the pace in terms of rolling out electric mobility and digital services like mobile phone-based payment systems, giving local suppliers an edge over European and United States competitors, Stark said.""In the area of connectivity services, the Chinese are ahead of the Americans; we have no choice but to deepen our relationship with these suppliers,"" he said, naming China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent as leading players.Daimler is also thinking about a broader alliance on batteries in view of the challenge of trying to police potential ethical or human rights violations in mining of rare earth minerals - such as cobalt, which is often found in conflict zones, but is needed for electric car batteries.""But there are no formal decisions in this area,"" Stark added.Mercedes is also scouting suppliers for innovations to see whether the German carmaker could make use of a more compact, lighter electric vehicle battery.Stark noted that denser, cheaper batteries with shorter recharging times could also allow Mercedes to bring down the cost of electric cars closer to their equivalent combustion-engined variants.""Overall volume and weight are as important as energy density,"" Stark said, referring to battery cells. By bundling orders for components for conventional and electric vehicles with the same supplier, Mercedes-Benz hopes to help its supplier base manage the transition between electric and non-electric cars.Separately, Stark said the replacement of Carlos Ghosn as  Renault  (PA:RENA) chairman will have no impact on an alliance between Renault and Mercedes.""We have a relatively stable cooperation and supply agreement with Renault-Nissan.

263,"Jan 22, 2019 07:04AM ET",TomTom at a crossroads after $1 billion sale of Telematics unit,nan,"By Toby SterlingAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - TomTom will remain independent and grow its core digital maps business, its CEO said on Tuesday after the company agreed to sell its fleet management business to Japan's Bridgestone for 910 million euros ($1 billion).Amsterdam-based TomTom faces a turning point after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) broke into the market to supply maps to carmakers last year, striking deals with  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volvo and upsetting a duopoly between TomTom and its traditional larger rival HERE. ""On the one hand (Google's entry) is scary, but on the other hand it really focuses the mind,"" said Harold Goddijn, TomTom's founder and CEO, in an interview with Reuters.The Telematics sale price was slightly higher than analysts had estimated when TomTom announced plans to sell it in September, but TomTom shares fell 2.1 percent to 7.88 euros after the deal was announced, as questions over the company's future returned to the fore.TomTom, which is debt-free, will return 750 million euros of the Telematics proceeds to shareholders via a capital repayment and keep 160 million euros to fund further development of its mapping and navigation technology, which is used in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) maps, among others. At the price announced on Tuesday, Telematics accounts for almost half of TomTom's 1.89 billion euro market capitalization.TomTom's remaining business is now implicitly valued at 4 times ING's estimates for its 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, ""which we find attractive despite the longer-term uncertainty for this business,"" analyst Marc Hesselink said in a note, repeating a ""Buy"" rating on the shares.""We believe that management will need to decide on what is the position of TomTom for the rump business as it is competing with much larger companies, Google and HERE, in an uncertain, quickly developing... environment towards increasing levels of automated driving,"" Hesselink said. Goddijn does not flatly rule out a takeover of TomTom but said the company plans to remain independent. TomTom's long-term profitability is ensured by its licensing revenues, which are supported by ""anchor"" customers such as Apple, he said.""More and more developers are using our (maps) to location-enable their applications and I think that's a positive sign,"" he said.He said that the company also still expects automotive revenue to grow, despite Google's inroads.

264,"Jan 21, 2019 11:48PM ET",Tokyo court denies latest bail request of Nissan's Ghosn,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's latest request for bail was rejected by a Tokyo court on Tuesday, despite the ousted Nissan chairman offering to wear an electronic ankle tag in an unusual bid to win release after two months of detention for alleged financial crimes.The ruling, widely anticipated, raises the likelihood that the 64-year-old executive will remain in custody until his trial, and will put pressure on Nissan's (T:7201) French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to find his successor as chairman and CEO.Renault's board is expected to meet in the coming days to decide who will succeed Ghosn, essentially removing him from the three-way alliance - which also includes Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) - which has been in turmoil since his arrest.Ghosn was almost immediately ousted from the chairmanship of Nissan and Mitsubishi after his initial arrest on Nov. 19, but remains chairman and CEO of their French partner. He has been officially charged for under-reporting his salary for eight years through March 2018 and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books. Ghosn denies the charges.The court did not give a reason for the denial. Bail is rarely granted for defendants in Japan without a confession.Ghosn's lawyer was not immediately available for comment after the Tokyo District Court announced its decision. Ghosn's latest bail request had also included an offer to hire guards to monitor him and a promise to remain in Tokyo, where he has leased an apartment. He offered to post stock he owns in Nissan as collateral, his spokeswoman said. An earlier request for bail was denied last week due to concerns the executive, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, was a flight risk, and that he may tamper with evidence if released.In a statement released on Monday, Ghosn repeated his intent to clear his name in court. ""I will attend my trial not only because I am legally obligated to do so, but because I am eager to finally have the opportunity to defend myself,"" he said.""I am not guilty of the charges against me and I look forward to defending my reputation in the courtroom."" PARTNERSHIP IN TURMOILThe arrest of the once-feted executive who orchestrated the turnaround of Nissan two decades ago, has clouded the future of the partnership between Nissan and Renault. Ghosn had pushed for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite strong reservations at the Japanese firm.On Monday, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said it was not the time to discuss revising the partners' complicated capital ties. Local media have reported that a French government delegation has informed Tokyo that it would seek an integration of Renault and Nissan, most likely under the umbrella of a single holding company.Renault owns a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn holds a non-voting 15 percent stake in Renault. The French government owns a 15 percent voting stake in Renault.Nissan, which has been conducting an internal probe into misconduct by Ghosn, believes he misused company funds for personal purposes, including payments related to his compensation, his residences dotted around the globe, and payments to family members, people with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

265,"Jan 21, 2019 06:30PM ET",Japan firms have no plans to strengthen governance after Ghosn arrest: Reuters poll,nan,"By Tetsushi KajimotoTOKYO (Reuters) - Three-quarters of Japanese companies have no plan to create committees overseeing compensation or executive nomination, a Reuters poll found, reflecting indifference to boosting governance after the arrest of former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn.Ghosn, credited with rescuing Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) from near-bankruptcy two decades ago, has been charged with understating his salary for eight years and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to the carmaker's books.He has been held at a detention center for over two months and his lawyer said he may not face trial for at least six months.Ghosn has denied wrongdoing. Both Nissan and affiliate Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) have nevertheless stripped him of his titles, and his continued chairmanship of French affiliate  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) is uncertain.The case has brought Nissan's governance to the fore, with critics saying there are few truly independent voices on its board capable of questioning leadership and looking out for regular shareholders' interests. Some managers surveyed agreed.""I was surprised that Nissan's internal governance over its executives was practically not functioning,"" a manager of a wholesaler wrote in the survey.Since Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest, Nissan's board has created a special committee to improve governance, incorporating external independent experts, and which will likely recommend an increase in external board members and the creation of a committee to oversee compensation.""Nissan acknowledges that the misconduct by its former chairman Carlos Ghosn and former representative director Greg Kelly was enabled by shortcomings in the company's corporate governance,"" a Nissan spokesman told Reuters.""The purpose of the committee is to find the root causes of this misconduct and provide recommendations for creating a more robust and sustainable governance framework worthy of a leading global company.""Some 64 percent of companies in the Reuters Corporate Survey have no plan to set up compensation or nominating committees, whereas 12 percent are considering the matter. Such committees are in place at 21 percent of responding companies and 3 percent plan to introduce committees shortly.""We are strengthening compliance, but it is impossible to say that misconduct won't occur,"" a service company manager wrote.Still, 87 percent of respondents believed it was unlikely their companies would face the same kind of problems over executive compensation, the Jan. 7-16 survey showed.The Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 480 big- and medium-sized firms with managers responding on condition of anonymity. Around 250 answered the questions on corporate governance.CEO PAYHigh executive pay is a touchy topic in Japan, where conspicuous consumption is frowned upon and wealth gaps are contentious. Japanese chief executive officers on average are paid just 11 percent of their U.S. counterparts, showed a report by CLSA Japan strategist Nicholas Smith.Reuters' survey found 38 percent of respondents believe executive pay in Japan should rise to a degree, with 3 percent saying it should be raised substantially. Some 56 percent saw no need to change executive pay and 2 percent said it should be reduced a little.""In corporate Japan, big pay gaps within the same company leads to lower motivation among employees,"" a manager of a transport equipment maker wrote in the Corporate Survey.Ghosn's reported pay in the latest financial year of $16.9 million dollars from Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi made him among the most well-paid executives at global auto companies.A stewardship code introduced in Japan in 2014 has prompted domestic fund managers to more actively question boards and management.But Japanese firms are not required to have a compensation committee and only 26 percent of listed firms do, with the practice being more common among bigger companies, said CLSA's Smith.Japan slid three places to seventh in a widely watched ranking of corporate governance in Asia, tying with India and languishing behind countries including Thailand and Malaysia, according to a biennial survey by CLSA and the Asian Corporate Governance Association.The report found that while Japanese efforts to improve governance by introducing better board-level oversight via independent directors and audit committees looked good on paper, boardroom reality had changed little at many firms.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Nothing is more important to me or to my family,"" he said. Nishioka, a former judge, added that he also saw problems with Nissan's governance, including the process of determining compensation for directors. The panel, comprising three Nissan external directors and four third-party members, expects to meet three or four times before making recommendations to Nissan's board in March on how to tighten lax governance and approval processes for matters including director compensation and chairman selection.All seven members attended the first meeting in Tokyo, including Jean-Baptiste Duzan, an external director based in France. For four hours, they discussed issues with two people involved with Nissan including how power had been heavily concentrated with Ghosn for years, Nishioka said, and possible ways to avoid such focus in the future.Nishioka added that such a concentration of authority in one person was ""questionable"".MOUNTING ALLEGATIONSNissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), in which Nissan owns a controlling 34 percent stake, have been conducting their own internal investigations into alleged wrongdoing by Ghosn. On Friday both accused him of improperly receiving $9 million in compensation from a joint venture between the two automakers, raising the possibility that the former boss of the Nissan-Renault alliance could face a fresh charge of embezzlement.Separate internal investigations have found evidence that a small group of people at both companies helped to carry out or approve transactions including secret compensation and payments on Ghosn's handful of residences, people with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.The arrest of Ghosn, who spearheaded Nissan's turnaround two decades ago, and the charges against him have jolted the auto industry, while muddying the outlook for Nissan's three-way alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors.Renault, which dominates the partnership through its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is expected to meet within days to consider potential candidates to replace Ghosn as CEO and chairman, sources have told Reuters.Despite repeated requests by Renault that Nissan hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting as soon as possible to select a new chairman, Nissan plans to wait for the committee's recommendations before making its nomination. Nissan's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled for June. Nishioka said the committee had yet to discuss possible procedures for chairman selection or governance issues related to the Nissan-Renault partnership including its capital structure. He did not rule out such discussions in the future.France's government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault and has long pushed for a closer tie-up between Renault and Nissan, has told Tokyo that it will seek an integration of the two companies, most likely under a single holding company, the Nikkei business newspaper reported on Sunday.Meanwhile, Ghosn's wife, Carole Ghosn, has written to French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss her husband's situation, her public relations representative said.The representative, Devon Spurgeon, confirmed a report in French paper Journal du Dimanche that a letter had been sent to Macron this month, but declined to provide details.Before his arrest, Ghosn had been working towards making the alliance ""irreversible"" and told Reuters in October that potential changes to the partnership's structure would come by June 2020.

The move is in line with Geely's ambitions to build more up-market cars and throw off its reputation for copycat designs and shoddy quality. For Lotus, it could mean greater production volumes and new models such as SUVs to boost sales.""For Geely, going high-end can help it take more market share,"" said Alan Kang, Shanghai based analyst at LMC Automotive. ""Geely needs to do that to better compete with global brands.""Lotus cars are currently built in Norfolk, England. Geely and Lotus said in a joint statement that while Norfolk was Lotus's manufacturing home, a key part of the firm's strategy to revive the brand was expanding the brand's manufacturing footprint globally. ""Details on additional locations and models will be confirmed in due course,"" the company said in an e-mail to Reuters.The planning authority of Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, last month approved Geely's plans for the plant. The factory will be able to manufacture 150,000 cars annually, according to a document posted on the authority's website. The Wuhan Development Zone, where the factory will be based, said in a statement posted on its website last month that production at the plant would include ""Geely's Lotus project"". The Wuhan Development Zone did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.The documents did not say when the plant would start operations. The facility is approved to build all-electric battery cars, electric hybrids as well as combustion engine cars like Lotuses.Job advertisements on Geely's website show the automaker is looking to fill at least 20 Wuhan-based roles for the Lotus project. LUXURY AMBITIONS While is not clear what portion of the new Chinese production line would be devoted to the British brand, greater production volumes would be consistent with Geely's stated ambition to grow the market for Lotus by broadening its line-up.Geely sold only 1,630 Lotuses globally in 2018. Lotus currently produces models such as the Evora and Elise. James Bond famously drove a Lotus Esprit in 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", and Lotus once boasted a Formula One team until it was sold to  Renault  (PA:RENA) for just one pound in 2015. But in a major break with the past, two sources familiar with the matter said Lotus would likely make luxury SUVs instead of sports cars during the Wuhan plant's initial phase. One of the sources said Geely wanted to emulate premium carmakers like  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), whose luxury SUV models were selling well in China. The share of luxury SUVs in China's overall passenger car market grew from 4.07 percent in 2014 to 5.01 percent in 2018, according to data from consultancy J.D. Power.Geely has forecast flat sales this year after the Chinese auto market contracted for the first time in more than two decades in 2018. The company has made waves in the auto world with its $9 billion purchase of a stake in Germany's Daimler AG (DE:DAIG) and its $1.8 billion acquisition of Sweden's Volvo. It bought 51 percent of Lotus from Malaysian automaker Proton in 2017.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

277,"Jan 16, 2019 04:07PM ET",French government calls for Renault board meeting to replace Ghosn,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Wednesday the government had requested a  Renault  (PA:RENA) board meeting in coming days to replace the company's scandal-hit Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn.The company needs a change of governance, Le Maire said in an interview with French TV station LCI, confirming an earlier Reuters report that France wanted a new Renault leadership.""We have to move to a new phase,"" the minister said.The government, Renault's biggest shareholder, had publicly supported the company's decision to keep Ghosn in office while he awaits trial in Japan for alleged misconduct at Nissan (T:7201), the French carmaker's alliance partner which he also chaired until his dismissal in November.Behind the scenes, however, the state had begun seeking candidates to replace Ghosn in November and December, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Renault's nominations committee is now expected to meet on Jan. 20, a source with knowledge of the matter said, followed by a full board meeting as soon as Monday under the interim chairmanship of Philippe Lagayette.Headhunter Korn Ferry has been advising Renault management on succession matters, with Emeric Lepoutre & Partners acting for the government.Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted.Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.Jean-Dominique Senard, who is soon to step down as CEO of tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), is likely to replace Ghosn in his chairman role, according to sources.The French state and its advisers are also considering candidates for the CEO job currently occupied on an interim basis by Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore.Others under consideration include senior Toyota (T:7203) executive Didier Leroy and  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) boss Philippe Guillemot, a person involved in the discussion said.Elior has denied Guillemot was a candidate, but acknowledged he may have been considered.Le Maire endorsed Senard as a ""great industrialist"" when asked about his potential candidacy.The move to replace Ghosn follows a Tokyo court decision to deny his request for release on bail, increasing the likelihood he will remain in jail for months. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in an interview on Monday he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker's ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

278,"Jan 16, 2019 01:55AM ET",Nissan plans to file for damages against Ghosn: source,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd plans to file a civil suit against ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn to claim damages resulting from the alleged misuse of company funds, a person with knowledge of the issue said, adding to the high-profile executive's legal headaches.Ghosn, who remains chairman and chief executive of Nissan's French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), has already been charged with three counts of financial misconduct and has been held at a detention centre in Tokyo for nearly two months.On Tuesday, a Tokyo court denied his request for release on bail, raising the possibility that he may remain in custody for months before his trial begins.Ghosn denies the charges against him, which include understating his salary for a total of eight years and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books.""The broader investigation (into Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct) continues to expand, so we will file a suit after that issue has been sorted out,"" said the person familiar with the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.A civil suit could seek losses related to the alleged use of company funds to pay for the executive's residences, donations to universities, and payments to a Saudi businessman who sources previously said helped Ghosn out of financial difficulties.Nissan declined to comment on the issue.Ghosn regularly spent more than 100 days a year flying between Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama and cities including Paris, and had residences in Tokyo, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam and Beirut.Nissan had been providing those residences to the executive, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, but people inside the company with knowledge of the issue said the company was only aware that it had been paying rent for Ghosn's apartment in Tokyo.Reuters last month reported that payments for some of Ghosn's residences were portioned out and processed through a Nissan unit in the Netherlands called Zi-A Capital BV and its subsidiaries, which initially had been set up to invest in technology start-ups.Nissan has confirmed that payments related to residences and other expenses such as a yacht club membership and donations to universities in Lebanon, Ghosn's ancestral homeland, had violated company procedures and its code of conduct, according to another person with knowledge of the issue.It is also considering filing for damages related to 7 million euros ($7.98 million) in compensation paid last year to Ghosn from a Dutch unit set up by Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp, that person said condition of anonymity, adding that Nissan's internal investigation has confirmed that those payments were made without the knowledge of the unit's board.Ghosn's arrest sent shockwaves through the auto industry and rocked Nissan's alliance with Mitsubishi and Renault.Having been credited for masterminding Nissan's financial turnaround two decades ago, the executive has since been removed from chairmanship positions at both Nissan and Mitsubishi.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But the government, which commands a 15 percent  Renault  stake and two board seats, has asked the company to convene its nominations committee followed by a full board meeting on Jan. 20 to begin the process of appointing one or more successors to Ghosn, according to three people briefed on the process.A spokesman for Renault and a French finance ministry official both said they had no knowledge of plans for a weekend board meeting.Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift firing by Nissan have deepened tensions with Renault, which owns a 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese carmaker.The French move to replace Ghosn follows a decision by the Tokyo District Court earlier on Tuesday to deny the ousted chairman's request for release on bail.Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later.

""All these options are on the table.""Leroy declined to comment, and attempts by Reuters to reach Senard at Michelin were unsuccessful. Headhunting firms Korn Ferry and Emeric Lepoutre & Partners, which are involved in the executive search, could not be reached after hours.French officials had said Ghosn should be kept in office unless it became clear he would remain ""incapacitated"" for much longer, also hinting that Tuesday's court decision would be an ""important development"".Two senior French finance ministry officials were traveling to Tokyo on Tuesday for talks with Nissan stakeholders aimed at stabilizing the alliance with Renault, daily Le Figaro reported.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in a Monday interview he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker's ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

281,"Jan 15, 2019 04:54AM ET",Tokyo court denies Nissan Ghosn's latest bail request,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday denied former Nissan Motor Co Ltd Chairman Carlos Ghosn's request for release on bail after his indictment last week on two new charges, making it likely the once-feted executive remains jailed for months.Lawyers for Ghosn have appealed the decision and could receive a response within the next day.Ghosn awaits a lengthy criminal trial that could be as long as six months away, his lawyers have said. It is rare in Japan for defendants who deny their charges to be granted bail ahead of trial.The executive has remained in a detention center in Tokyo since Nov. 19, when he was first arrested on allegations of under-reporting his salary for five years through 2015.The court did not give a reason for denying bail. At a hearing last week, when his lawyers asked for reasons for his continued detention, the court cited concerns that Ghosn would try to flee or tamper with evidence.Ghosn was indicted on Friday on charges of aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008, and understating his salary for three additional years through March 2018. He has denied the charges.His arrest sent shockwaves through the auto industry and rocked Nissan's alliance with Mitsubishi Motors Corp and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).Ghosn, who masterminded Nissan's financial turnaround two decades ago, has since been removed from chairmanship positions at Nissan and Mitsubishi, but remains chairman and chief executive at Renault.The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, said it supports Renault's decision to keep Ghosn at its helm unless it becomes clear he will be ""chronically incapacitated"" by the Japanese investigation, officials said on Monday.The prospect of a lengthy detention could increase pressure on the Renault board and shareholders including France's government to appoint permanent new leadership for the carmaker. Tuesday is likely to see ""important developments"" in relation to that question, one French official said.UNDER SCRUTINYThe case has also put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.Ghosn's wife, Carole Ghosn, has complained about her husband's ""harsh treatment"" in detention, including being held in a small, unheated room and being pressured by prosecutors to confess, according to a letter she wrote to Human Rights Watch's Japan director Kanae Doi.She urged the group to ""shine a light on the harsh treatment of my husband and the human rights-related inequities inflicted upon him by the Japanese justice system.""Doi said in an e-mail to Reuters that the country's justice system ""certainly warrants the international pressure and attention it is getting now.""Doi also forwarded a comment from Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams, who in an opinion piece published in the Diplomat magazine on Thursday said, ""Ghosn's case is emblematic of serious and longstanding problems in Japan's criminal justice system, which affect ordinary Japanese citizens on a daily basis.""Japan's Ministry of Justice was unreachable for comment outside of business hours.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I think that once that's the case, they will draw the same conclusions as we did.""Ghosn's November arrest in Japan and dismissal by Nissan have deepened tensions with its French parent Renault - which has so far maintained Ghosn in office as chairman and CEO, citing the presumption of innocence.A spokesman for Renault, which has said judicial confidentiality requires tight restrictions on access to Nissan's findings even by its own board members, did not return calls and messages seeking comment.Ghosn has been charged over allegations that he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted. Both men deny that the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.Saikawa's interview was published ahead of an expected court hearing in Japan on Tuesday, at which Ghosn's lawyers are to present a request for his release on bail.The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, will support the decision to keep Ghosn at its helm unless it becomes clear he will be ""chronically incapacitated"" by the Japanese investigation, officials said on Monday.Tuesday is likely to see ""important developments"" in relation to that question, one French official said.OLIVE BRANCHSaikawa extended an olive branch to Renault and its state shareholder, while also dismissing French speculation that the scandal had been engineered by Nissan to oust Ghosn and end Renault's control.""It's absurd and I don't understand how anyone can believe such a scenario for a second,"" he said. ""Look at the evidence; it's serious.""While the presumption of innocence must be observed in criminal matters, Saikawa added, the Nissan board's unanimous decision to dismiss Ghosn was grounded in ethical considerations and ""the facts brought to light"".Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent holding in the French carmaker carries no voting rights.Saikawa also appeared to soften his own earlier calls for changes to guarantee Nissan more autonomy and potentially restore its voting rights - which had rung alarm bells in Paris.While investors do want to see the alliance structure evolve, Saikawa said, ""that is really not the current priority.""""The important thing today is to stabilize things and work together trustingly - not to know whether Nissan should have voting rights in Renault,"" he added in the interview.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""But if Japan wants to live up to its reputation as one of the world's most advanced democracies, it needs to modernize its criminal justice system,"" he added.""Regardless of the serious allegations against him, or the controversies surrounding his tenure at Nissan, no one should have their rights violated in this way while facing criminal charges.""Nissan said last Friday it had filed a criminal complaint against Ghosn with Tokyo prosecutors related to the misuse of a ""significant amount of the company's funds"".The former Nissan executive is being held in a 75-sq-foot (6.97-sq-m) unheated cell and being denied daily medication, his wife said in her letter.

""No one should be forced to endure what my husband faces every day, particularly in a developed nation like Japan, the third largest economy in the world.""Ghosn said he was ""wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations"" during a Tokyo court proceeding last week, his first public appearance since his November arrest, at which he seemed noticeably thinner.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Jose Munoz, widely considered as a close ally to Ghosn and a possible successor to lead the automaking partnership between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), had been a ""person of interest"" in Nissan's widening internal investigation.The 53-year-old, who was Nissan's chief performance officer and head of its China operations, made the announcement in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post on Friday. In a statement, Nissan said that Munoz had ""elected to resign"" from the company, effective immediately. It declined to offer details. He becomes the latest executive casualty since Nissan in November removed Ghosn as chairman and fired representative director Greg Kelly.The resignation deals another blow to the Japanese automaker which is grappling with the scandal at a time when it is struggling to shore up profitability in the United States and expand aggressively in China.Reuters had reported earlier on Friday that the Japanese automaker was looking into decisions made in the United States by Munoz who led Nissan's North American operations from 2016 to 2018.""Unfortunately, Nissan is currently involved in matters that have and will continue to divert its focus,"" Munoz said in his post.""As I have repeatedly and recently made clear to the company, I look forward to continuing to assist Nissan in its investigations.""People with knowledge of the issue have said that Munoz, who had been placed on a leave of absence earlier in the month, had not been co-operating with the internal investigation.Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan's alliance with Renault, remains in custody in a Tokyo detention center since his initial arrest in late November.Ghosn has been indicted on two counts of under-reporting his income, and aggravated breach of trust for temporarily shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan. The scandal has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and has escalated tensions between Nissan and Renault, where Ghosn remains CEO and chairman. Munoz joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe and led its significant expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States and posted record sales. Earlier this year, Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years. Since then, the world's largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

285,"Jan 11, 2019 04:05PM ET",Corporate investors pile into electric vehicle startups,nan,"By Paul LienertDETROIT (Reuters) - Corporate investors from outside the auto industry are placing increasing bets on electric vehicles, vying with automakers and suppliers to bankroll startup companies working on everything from advanced batteries to charging devices and all-new EVs.Some 250 startups involved in some aspect of electrification have attracted more than $20 billion in venture capital, notably from a broad array of corporations across multiple industries, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available data. ""Electrification will set off a number of economic changes in the traditional value chain in and around vehicles,"" said Reilly Brennan, managing director of San Francisco-based Trucks Venture Capital.Because of those changes, in addition to funding EV development, investors see revenue opportunities in related markets, such as consumer products and home energy, Brennan said.Such opportunities are underpinned by steady improvements in lithium-ion batteries' energy, prompting forecasts for a surge in fleet electrification amid global efforts to fight fuel consumption and emissions from traditional internal combustion engines.Big oil companies such as  BP  (LON:BP) PLC and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC see EV-related investments partly as a hedge against dwindling demand for fossil fuels for privately owned vehicles, according to venture investor Evangelos Simoudis, managing director of Synapse Partners.But they also see an opportunity to provide electric vehicle charging at fuel stations that now dispense gasoline and diesel. Simoudis, who advises corporate executives on new mobility innovation strategy, said aerospace companies have a vested interest, too, in startups working on advanced battery systems: ""Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus are both working on electric planes.""Large telecommunication companies such as  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) will play a role in connected electric vehicles, while semiconductor makers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc see their computer chips being used in an increasing number of applications in future electric and self-driving vehicles, Simoudis added.Far and away the most active corporate investor in electrification so far is Intel, which has backed battery startups Prieto, Qnovo and Enovix and charging startups WiTricity and Chargifi.Global automakers are heavily invested in battery startups. The field includes General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), BMW AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co, Hyundai Motror Co and SAIC Motor Corp.Outside the auto industry, corporate investors in battery startups include technology companies Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI) and energy company Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB). Dozens of the startups focused on EV charging and infrastructure have been funded by many of the same corporate investors, including  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and ABB AG (ABB.UL). The greatest interest from investors, however, is in EV startups. There are more than 50 globally, including several high-profile and well-funded Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) wannabes based in China.Corporate investment in China's startups has come from big Chinese companies such as automaker FAW Car Co and battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co, which have backed Byton; automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] and technology firm Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), which have funded WM Motor, and internet giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, which has invested in Xiaopeng Motors.In the United States, GM and BMW have backed Proterra, the electric bus maker, while  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), which is best known for heavy construction machinery, has invested in Henrik Fisker's latest electric vehicle project, Fisker Inc.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

286,"Jan 11, 2019 10:41AM ET","Nissan expands Ghosn probe to more countries, executive Munoz under scrutiny: sources",nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) has broadened its investigation into ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn to include dealings that took place in the United States, India and Latin America, three people with knowledge of the inquiry said.In one aspect of their internal probe, company investigators are looking into decisions made in the United States by Jose Munoz who led Nissan's North American operations from 2014 to 2018, the people said. Munoz was recently placed on a leave of absence due to the probe, they added.Nissan said this month that Munoz, its chief performance officer and widely seen within the industry as close to Ghosn, was on leave ""to allow him to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events.""Munoz is not cooperating with investigators, two of the people with knowledge of the probe said, both describing his actions as ""stonewalling"".One of the sources described Munoz, who currently heads Nissan's China operations, as a ""person of interest"" in the probe, adding that it was not clear whether he would be accused of any wrongdoing.Munoz, 53, did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. The people with knowledge of the probe spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. A lawyer for Ghosn, Motonari Otsuru, said in an emailed comment: ""I am unaware of this."" Some of the questions put to Munoz relate to dealer franchise rights, one of the sources said. Other questions relate to contracts with parts suppliers and service providers that Munoz approved when he was at the helm of Nissan's U.S. operations, another source said.The sources said the findings made as part of the probe into Ghosn's affairs in the U.S. market are being shared with prosecutors. Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment.Nissan has said its internal investigation had uncovered ""substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct"" by Ghosn and that its scope is expanding. Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan's alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), has been charged with under-reporting his income. On Friday, he was also charged with aggravated breach of trust, accused of shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan. In his first public appearance since his Nov. 19 arrest, Ghosn declared his innocence in court on Tuesday, saying he had never received compensation that was not disclosed and that Nissan had not suffered any losses due to a temporary transfer of a personal foreign exchange contract. The transfer had been a temporary measure to prevent him from having to resign and use his retirement funds as collateral, Ghosn said.Sources familiar with the matter have also said Nissan investigators are examining other dealer franchise decisions in several countries where Ghosn played a part in the decision-making to see if there had been any misconduct. In particular, the automaker's investigators are looking into Ghosn's role in what Nissan insiders have described to Reuters as a surprise decision in 2008 to pick a company called Hover Automotive India Pvt Ltd (HAI) as Nissan's partner for marketing, sales, after-sales service and dealer development in India.A different firm, TVS, had been lined up for the role after much research by Nissan management in India when Ghosn personally intervened at the last minute to push for HAI, four Nissan insiders said. They add that in 2012, HAI became the Nissan's exclusive national sales firm in India, despite being relatively inexperienced in distributing vehicles to dealers.Reuters was unable to find a representative for HAI, which according to India's Registrar of Companies was dissolved as of Sept. 11, 2018. TVS did not respond to a request for comment.The probe is also looking at what appear to be outsized payments for Ghosn's bodyguard services in Brazil, one of the sources said. Ghosn's lawyer Otsuru did not respond to requests for comment on the expansion of Nissan's probe into dealings in India and Brazil. A U.S. representative for Ghosn declined to comment.One source also said Nissan is conducting audits of some distribution partners in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia's Al-Dahana which owns half of a joint venture called Nissan Gulf with the other half held by a wholly owned unit of Nissan Motor. Al-Dahana, a marketing and dealer development firm, is majority owned by Khaled Al-Juffali, vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia's largest conglomerates. Reuters has reported that Al-Juffali is the person prosecutors believe arranged a letter of credit for Ghosn over his foreign exchange contract after which a company that Al-Juffali owned received four payments totaling $14.7 million. Both Ghosn and the Khaled Juffali Company have asserted that the payments were for legitimate business purposes. Asked about the audit, a representative for the Khaled Juffali Company said the firm stood by its previous statement.Another Nissan executive, Arun Bajaj, senior vice president for human resources and who heads talent development for Nissan's alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), has also been put on a leave of absence ""to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events.""Bajaj is being questioned and is cooperating with both Nissan's internal investigators as well as prosecutors, the sources said, adding that they expect him to return to work soon. It was not immediately clear what the questions were about. Bajaj did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Ghosn is unlikely to be granted bail and is expected to remain in detention throughout his trial as is often the case under Japan's criminal system, Otsuru told reporters this week. Ghosn's trial may not begin for another six months, he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

287,"Jan 11, 2019 05:22AM ET",Nissan ex-chief Ghosn seeks bail after indictment on two new charges,nan,"By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Tim KellyTOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan ex-Chairman Carlos Ghosn has requested his release on bail after being indicted in Tokyo on Friday on two new charges, his lawyers said, as the once-feted auto executive awaits a lengthy criminal trial that could be as long as six months away.Ghosn was the overlord of an alliance that included Nissan Motor (T:7201), Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) and France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), until his surprise November arrest and removal as chairman of both Japanese automakers sent shockwaves through the industry.The former executive, lauded for rescuing Nissan from the financial brink two decades ago, was charged with aggravated breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan in 2008.Ghosn, former Representative Director Greg Kelly and Nissan itself were also charged for understating Ghosn's income for three years through March 2018. The three parties have already been indicted for the same charge covering the years 2010-2015.Ghosn and Kelly have denied all charges. Nissan said it regretted any concern caused to its stakeholders.It is rare in Japan for defendants who deny their charges to be granted bail ahead of trial. Kelly posted bail on Christmas Day and is unable to leave Japan without special permission. Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, expects his client to be held until trial, which he said could begin in about six months. If bail is granted, Ghosn - who is suffering from fever, according to his lawyer - would not likely be released until Tuesday given that Monday is public holiday.Kelly, a Ghosn ally, was hospitalized for treatment of a pre-existing neck problem after his release and has since been discharged, said his lawyer Yoichi Kitamura.""This second indictment for Kelly comes as no surprise as it merely makes what was a five year period for the first into eight years,"" Kitamura said.Kitamura said he expects Ghosn and Kelly to be tried together on the two charges of understating income, and that he will work closely with Ghosn's legal team.NISSAN COMPLAINTAlso on Friday, Nissan said it had filed a criminal complaint against its former leader.The automaker, in a statement, said it filed the complaint ""on the basis of Ghosn's misuse of a significant amount of the company's funds. Nissan does not in any way tolerate such misconduct and calls for strict penalties.""Ghosn, 64, appeared in court on Tuesday for the first time since his arrest, looking thinner and greyer. He denied the allegations, calling them ""meritless"" and ""unsubstantiated"".He said he had asked Nissan to temporarily take on his foreign exchange contracts after the 2008-2009 financial crisis prompted his bank to call for more collateral. He said he did so to avoid having to resign and use his retirement allowance for collateral.Ghosn's lawyer Otsuru on Tuesday said Nissan had agreed to the arrangement on condition that any losses or gains would be Ghosn's. Ghosn said the contracts were transferred back to him and that Nissan did not incur a loss.On Thursday, the boards of Nissan and controlling shareholder Renault - where Ghosn remains chairman - met for an update on the matter. Nissan later said it remained committed to the alliance.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

288,"Jan 11, 2019 02:28AM ET",How Santander's Brazil unit is driving growth with car loans,nan,"By Carolina MandlSAO PAULO (Reuters) - At BM Multimarcas, a used-car dealer on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, owner Santel de Abreu Bernardo can show you jalopies that most big banks would not touch.There is a faded blue 2003  Renault  (PA:RENA) hatchback with 195,000 kilometers on the dial. And a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Gol Turbo so old that it could vote.But when he needs to seal a deal, Bernardo has a go-to option for financing: the Brazilian unit of Spain's  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN).It has grabbed 25 percent of the market for car loans in Latin America's largest country, in part by extending credit to borrowers shunned by other mainstream banks. That means financing working-class customers in need of cheap motorcycles and cars up to two decades old.That business helped power Madrid-based Santander through Brazil's recent deep recession, even as domestic rivals Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA hit the brakes, and other foreign banks such as London-based HSBC Plc and U.S.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) sold their struggling Brazilian retail businesses.There are risks to Santander's strategy, as any used-car veteran will tell you.""When an old car breaks down, its owner prefers spending money to fix it rather than paying down debt,"" said Bernardo of BM Multimarcas. ""That's why many banks don't like financing old cars.""Yet Santander, Brazil's third-largest private-sector bank, is cruising. Its 90-day default ratio is the lowest among Brazil's largest private banks, at 2.9 percent in September.Year-over-year consumer loan growth in Brazil hit 22.6 percent in September, more than triple the industry average of 7 percent. Brazil unit profitability, which for years has lagged peers, jumped to 19.4 percent from 16.3 percent in the same period. That beat Bradesco, the country's second-largest private lender, and narrowed the gap with industry-leading Itau. Santander’s increasing reliance on Brazil shows how emerging markets can still provide a jolt of growth. The Brazilian unit contributed 26 percent of group profits in the first nine months of 2018, up from 19 percent four years ago. Santander Brasil's stock price has surged more than two thirds in the last 12 months, vastly outperforming the shares of its parent company, as well as those of Itau and Bradesco.Still, Santander Brasil's outsized auto loan portfolio, and its willingness to bet on borrowers and vehicles avoided by competitors, could presage a bumpier road ahead in a country with a history of economic volatility.""Certainly, Santander's growth strategy is a success story so far,"" said Andre Martins, an analyst at XP Investimentos. ""But the bank will be the one most exposed to defaults if the Brazilian economy turns down.""(For a graphic on Santander Brasil's share of auto loans in Brazil, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2GtCxFR) RISK MANAGEMENTFor now, Brazil's economy appears to be on the upswing. And Santander executives say their strategy is battle-tested.Around 80 percent of the Brazil unit's auto loans are on cars aged four years or less, and down payments are hefty, averaging 36 percent.""If Santander's loan book were problematic, it would already have popped after a 3-year historic recession,"" said Angel Santodomingo, chief financial officer for Santander Brasil. ""Our success in credit quality is related to our ability to analyze and price individuals' risk.""Santodomingo would not reveal Santander's secret sauce. But the bank is harnessing big data to glean information beyond borrower income and savings. And Brazil risk officers are using company tools that have proven successful elsewhere, including the United States, where Santander is a major subprime auto lender.The bank has also embraced the internet to grow its business, leveraging online sales generated through WebMotors, a top car-selling website that it owns.Two years ago it launched an app that allows dealers to arrange car loans within minutes for buyers who provide eight pieces of information, an innovation that is now being copied by other Brazilian banks. That process had previously taken at least a day and required car buyers to provide reams of documentation. If a loan is approved, clients sign the contract digitally.""It saves a lot of time,"" said Eduardo de Jesus, a salesman at Basile Center Car, located in a middle-class neighborhood on Sao Paulo's northwest side. Santander plans to use that model to grow its consumer finance business in Brazil with loans for vacations, building materials and solar panels, according to Andre Novaes, head of Santander's consumer finance unit. Many Brazilian banks have avoided such lending because of the high default risk and shaky collateral. To safeguard its portfolio, Santander said it has encouraged highly-indebted clients to refinance and consolidate different types of loans in arrears into a single loan with more amicable terms.Some bankers, however, view the practice as a way to mask Santander’s default ratio.Severe losses in 2011 forced Itau and Bradesco to stop financing low-end motorcycles, and to ban cars aged ten years and older from their portfolios. They also increased down payments and shortened loan maturities, which had stretched as long as 70 months.RIAL AT THE HELMSantander has been in Brazil since 1982. It has made a few good-sized acquisitions, including the purchase of the Brazil unit of Amsterdam-based ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) in 2007. But most of its organic growth spurt has come under Sergio Rial, who took the CEO job at Santander Brasil in January 2016.A lawyer and economist, Rial served a stint as chief financial officer at the grains trader Cargill Inc and as a board member at ABN AMRO. He was chief executive of the Brazilian meatpacker Marfrig when Ana Botin, the executive chairman of Santander Group, tapped him for the top job in Brazil.(Santander Brasil share's outperform rivals: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ADY3Cx)While car loans have juiced growth, Rial has also bet on safer credit lines, including payroll loans and mortgages, as well as credit cards. Overall, Rial has been strengthening Santander's retail arm to the detriment of corporate loans. Consumer loans comprise 70 percent of the bank's loan book, up 12 percentage points from when Rial took the CEO post.To engage the bank's employees, Rial has tied more of their compensation to performance; variable compensation increased 16 percent from 2015 to 2017 even as the bank's payroll shrunk roughly 7 percent. The number of clients has increased for 40 straight months, reaching 23.4 million in September.Still, the auto loan business remains the bank's standout in terms of growth. De Jesus, the car salesman at Basile Center Car, said Santander's rivals are paying attention. ""When clients come to a store, they want to know exactly if the down payment suits their pockets, and Santander's tools show it immediately,"" he said. ""Other banks are copying it now.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sepehri did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.""Individual compensation, while entirely justified, is not publicly disclosed, in accordance with the law,"" a Renault spokesman said in an emailed statement. ""Renault would be outraged by any publication of an identified executive's pay, which constitutes personal information.""Sepehri currently sits on the RNBV board with nine other Renault and Nissan executives, and is the only director who drew a compensation package directly from the subsidiary, according to the documents and a senior alliance executive.She received 200,000 euros in 2013 and 100,000 euros annually from 2014-16 in addition to her Renault pay, according to statements addressed to her each year and the minutes of a 2013 meeting at which Ghosn and Kelly ordered the payments ""for the performance of her duties as a management board member"".""It's important as a general rule that board secretaries avoid allowing themselves to be influenced by a CEO who might promise them remuneration through a subsidiary,"" said Loic Dessaint, head of Proxinvest, a prominent shareholder advisory firm based in Paris.""If Ms Sepehri has been paid by RNBV, it is a conflict of interest situation,"" Dessaint said. ""At a minimum, Renault directors should have known about it.""Ghosn and Kelly have been charged in Japan with failing to disclose $43 million in additional compensation for 2010-15 that Ghosn had arranged to be paid later. They deny that the deferred compensation agreements were illegal or required disclosure.UNDISCLOSED PAYThe finances of RNBV and other alliance subsidiaries are under scrutiny in the Nissan investigation that led to Ghosn's November arrest and ouster as the Japanese carmaker's chairman.The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, has also demanded that the carmaker provide information about RNBV payments to its executives.Sepehri is among a small group of alliance executives who have previously attempted to find legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters reported on Dec. 19.In 2010, she and Kelly worked on proposals to create an additional source of CEO compensation through RNBV, but later dropped the plan after concluding it would not avoid French legal disclosure requirements.She and a handful of top managers were also involved in a 2017 project to pay out millions of euros in undisclosed bonuses via a new Dutch service company. The plan, of which Ghosn was the main beneficiary, was scrapped after Reuters revealed https://reut.rs/2R5zQ1j its existence in June of the same year.Both efforts, which Renault has confirmed, were designed explicitly to keep the company's board and shareholders in the dark about significant compensation to the CEO, while working within the law and Renault-Nissan rules.The scandal surrounding Ghosn and Kelly has strained Nissan's ties with 43.4 percent-owner Renault - which has maintained Ghosn as chairman and CEO, with his deputy Thierry Bollore as an interim stand-in.Members of the Renault board, which includes French state representatives, say they have yet to be given full access to Nissan investigation findings shared with company lawyers reporting to Sepehri.Her role gives her control over communications, legal and public affairs, as well as the flow of information to the board.The access restrictions are required for judicial confidentiality, Renault said. The carmaker dismissed questions about a potential conflict of interest for Sepehri.""Ms Sepehri occupies a typical general secretary function,"" Renault said, adding that the company was ""relying on the opinion of its lawyers and advisors"" in dealing with the Nissan investigation findings.Three years after joining the French carmaker as deputy legal director, Sepehri helped negotiate the 1999 acquisition of near-bankrupt Nissan, where Ghosn - then Renault's second-in-command - led the lightning turnaround that made his name.As their alliance deepened, Renault-Nissan BV was founded in 2002 as a jointly funded management organization.GOVERNMENT PRESSUREFrance's left-wing CGT union, which has a seat on Renault's board, said recently it had contacted Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire to denounce RNBV's ""opaque workings"", citing payments to an executive it did not identify.In response, the government demanded details of any undisclosed executive payments by the Dutch holding, in a Jan. 4 letter to Renault.""I want to know who these payments were made to, whether they were disclosed, whether they correspond to work carried out and whether the Renault board and shareholders were informed about them,"" Le Maire said on CNews television.Ghosn and Kelly agreed on March 26, 2013 that RNBV would pay Sepehri 125,000 euros immediately, and monthly payments thereafter amounting to 100,000 euros per year, according to the minutes of their decision.    The two men were meeting as the RNBV board's ""governance, appointments and remuneration committee"". Its third member, Sepehri, had recused herself, the same document notes.Four annual statements issued by RNBV confirm the subsequent payments, with a Dutch withholding tax deducted. While all RNBV directors were salaried Renault or Nissan managers, Sepehri was alone in receiving additional compensation for her board role.In its response to Reuters, Renault said RNBV's board of directors - who also include Ghosn, Bollore and Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa - was informed about members' compensation.""The RNBV management report, which is approved by the board and auditors, includes information about its executives' pay,"" the company said.However, Sepehri's fellow directors of unlisted RNBV were not told who received the 100,000 euros mentioned only as compensation to ""board members"", according to a senior alliance executive who has seen the annual reports. He spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.""There was no official board decision on this compensation,"" he said. Other alliance executives and RNBV directors declined to comment when approached by Reuters.For Proxinvest, which advises large financial investors on how to vote at shareholder meetings, the RNBV board process also raises concerns.""Good governance requires that a committee proposal should be approved by the full board,"" CEO Dessaint said.

He was wearing a navy suit and white shirt without a tie, and looked thinner than before his arrest, with his dark hair showing gray roots.""I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations,"" the 64-year-old executive told the Tokyo District Court in a clear voice, reading from a prepared statement.""I believe strongly that in all of my efforts on behalf of the company, I have acted honorably, legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company,"" he said.From early morning, a crowd of journalists and television crews thronged outside the courthouse, and some 1,122 people lined up for 14 court seats assigned by lottery, highlighting strong interest in the case. News of the hearing was given top billing on public broadcaster NHK throughout the day.The court hearing, requested by Ghosn's lawyers, was held to explain the reasons for his prolonged detention since his Nov. 19 arrest rather than to argue merits of the case. Judge Yuichi Tada said the detention was due to flight risk and the possibility he could conceal evidence.But Ghosn used the opportunity to deny accusations against him, kicking off what is expected to be a lengthy counter-attack against the accusations.Former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara said the court appearance was a public relations victory for Ghosn because it gave him an opportunity to counter the weeks of negative news about him.""In this high-profile case, news had been dominated by information from the prosecutors and Nissan, so the public tended to view him accordingly,"" he said. ""But today it was all Ghosn. That's very significant.""After weeks of silence, Ghosn's lawyers insisted in an afternoon press conference that the courts have no reason to keep him behind bars during the investigation.On Dec. 31, the Tokyo District Court granted prosecutors' request to extend Ghosn's detention by 10 days until Jan. 11. But former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, who heads Ghosn's defense team, said it was likely Ghosn would stay in custody until the trial starts, which could be in six months, given the practice in Japan of keeping defendants locked up until trial.The Tokyo District Court said later on Tuesday that Ghosn's lawyers have asked for an end to his detention. One of Ghosn's lawyers, Masato Oshikubo, told Reuters that a reply from the court to the request could come on Wednesday. INVESTMENT LOSSES AND SAUDI PAYMENTSGhosn has been formally charged with under-reporting his income. He has also been arrested, but not yet indicted, on allegations of aggravated breach of trust in shifting personal investment losses to the carmaker.""I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed,"" Ghosn told the court.Regarding allegations that he transferred losses to Nissan, Ghosn said he had asked the company to temporarily take on his foreign exchange contracts after the 2008-2009 financial crisis prompted his bank to call for more collateral. He said he did this to avoid having to resign and use his retirement allowance for collateral.""My moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time,"" said Ghosn. ""A captain doesn't jump ship in the middle of a storm."" Otsuru said that Nissan had agreed to the arrangement, on condition that any losses or gains would be Ghosn's. Ghosn said the contracts were transferred back to him and that Nissan did not incur a loss.Ghosn is also accused of paying $14.7 million to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali using Nissan funds in exchange for arranging a letter of credit to help with his investment losses.Ghosn said that Juffali's company was compensated for ""critical services that substantially benefited Nissan"", including soliciting financing and resolving a business dispute.The Khaled Juffali Company has issued a statement saying it had received the payments for legitimate business purposes. Nissan, which has ousted Ghosn as chairman, reiterated that its internal investigation prompted by an informant had uncovered ""substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct"" and that its investigation was ongoing and expanding in scope.ALLIANCE RATTLEDThe case has rattled Nissan's alliance with French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), where Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive. He had been pushing for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger at the French government's urging, despite strong reservations at Nissan.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday Ghosn is presumed innocent until proven guilty and that there is therefore no reason to remove him from the top job at Renault. The French government is Renault's main shareholder.""If the situation were to last an unreasonable period - and I don't have a period in mind, but if the situation were to last indefinitely - of course, we would have to make a decision, but we are not at this point,"" Le Maire said on a French TV station.French Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud reiterated the government's call for Nissan and Renault to preserve the alliance, seen as crucial for the two to compete long-term amid trends such as autonomous driving. ""The most important thing today is that the presumption of innocence is respected and that we look after the Renault-Nissan alliance. There are many jobs at stake,"" she told a television news channel.Ghosn's arrest has also put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Ghosn has been held at the Tokyo Detention Center, a spartan facility where small rooms have a toilet in the corner and no heater. His son, Anthony Ghosn, said his father had lost 10 kgs (22 pounds) during his detention, according to France's weekly Journal du Dimanche.Otsuru said Ghosn had been moved to a larger room with a western-style bed, but did not say when that had happened.Nissan's Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also arrested on Nov. 19 and has been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn's income, was released on Dec. 25 after posting bail of 70 million yen, or about $640,000, in cash.($1 = 108.2900 yen)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I want to know who these payments were made to, if they were declared and therefore whether ... the Renault board was aware of them.""A Renault spokesman did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment.The Ghosn affair, sparked by a Nissan internal investigation, has rocked the auto industry, strained Nissan's ties with Renault and complicated diplomatic relations between Japan and the France.A one-time titan of the auto industry, Ghosn, who has since been ousted as Nissan chairman, is also accused of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan.Ghosn denies all the charges against him.Renault board members including the French state's representatives have yet to be given full access to Nissan's findings against Ghosn, which have been shared with Renault's lawyers. The restrictions are justified by judicial confidentiality, the company has said. Executives from both carmakers - including Renault General Secretary Mouna Sepehri, who oversees communications with the board - had looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters revealed last month.Those two efforts were ultimately abandoned. Immediately after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest, however, Nissan told Renault privately it was extending its internal investigation to cover their Dutch-registered alliance holdings.Ghosn will make his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing for an explanation on his continued detention.Ghosn's son, Anthony, told the Journal du Dimanche that Japanese prosecutors wanted his father to sign a confession..  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

296,"Jan 04, 2019 10:23PM ET",Nissan's executive Munoz takes leave of absence in wake of Ghosn arrest,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A senior executive of Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), Jose Munoz, has taken a leave of absence in a sudden management shake-up as the Japanese automaker deals with the aftermath of the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn.Munoz's absence comes as Ghosn has been held in a detention center since his Nov. 19 arrest on allegations of financial misconduct, which was followed by re-arrests over further allegations. In a statement on Saturday, Nissan said that Munoz has taken a leave of absence ""to allow him to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events."" As a result, his planned appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week would be canceled, a Nissan spokesman said.Reuters could not immediately reach Munoz for comment.Munoz is considered by many in the company to be a close ally of Ghosn, whose arrest has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he still remains chairman and chief executive.It has prompted some soul searching at the Japanese automaker, which has acknowledged that too much power was concentrated with Ghosn after he oversaw the turnaround of the struggling automaker two decades ago following its rescue from the brink by Renault.After stripping Ghosn of his chairman position following his arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault. Munoz, who serves as Nissan's chief performance officer, joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe, and led its ambitious expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States, but profitability in the region has plummeted in the past few years due to heavy discounting on its vehicles, an issue that Saikawa has pledged to reverse.Earlier this year Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China, where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years. Since then, the world's largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The reason behind the timing of Ghosn's request was not clear.Earlier this week, the court approved an extension to Ghosn's detention until Jan. 11, after re-arrest by prosecutors who accuse him of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan.Those allegations center on the use of company funds to pay a Saudi businessman who is believed to have helped him out of financial difficulties, sources said last week.Ghosn has already been indicted for under-reporting his income. He has denied the allegations, local media has said.Former Nissan executive Greg Kelly, who has been charged with conspiring to under-report Ghosn's income, has been released on bail after the court ruled against extending his detention while he awaits trial.Ghosn's arrest was followed by his removal from roles at Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211). The case has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he still remains chairman and chief executive.The arrest has also put some of the practices of Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

299,"Dec 31, 2018 03:43AM ET",Tokyo court says extends detention of Nissan's Ghosn until Jan 11,nan,"By Daniel LeussinkTOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo District Court said on Monday it has extended the detention of ousted Nissan Motor Co chairman Carlos Ghosn by 10 days until Jan. 11.Ghosn, accused of aggravated breach of trust, is facing allegations of making the car maker shoulder 1.85 billion yen ($16.8 million) in personal investment losses.The latest extension will see Ghosn remain in Tokyo's main detention center, where he has been confined since his first arrest on Nov. 19 on allegations of financial misconduct.Since then, he has been re-arrested twice over the latest allegations and on claims that he underreported his Nissan salary for a prolonged period. He denies the allegations.Calls to the office of Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, were not answered on Monday, an unofficial holiday in Japan.A Nissan spokesman said the car maker was not in a position to comment on the latest development in the case.""The company's own investigation is ongoing, and its scope continues to broaden,"" the spokesman said.The decision to extend Ghosn's time in detention comes a day before his 10-day detention period for the latest allegation was set to expire on Tuesday, and follows the release of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly on bail last week after a court ruled against extending his detention while he awaits trial.Both Ghosn and Kelly were initially arrested in late November and have been charged with underreporting Ghosn's salary at Nissan over a five-year period from 2010. Both deny the charges.Nissan's board in November fired Ghosn as chairman and Kelly as representative director, although both men technically still remain board members who can only be removed by shareholders.Ghosn's arrest has rocked the auto industry and strained Nissan's ties with French automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), where Ghosn still remains chairman and CEO.Ghosn served as CEO of Nissan for more than a decade through 2017 and concurrently held the chairman position at Renault, Nissan and partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp until his arrest. The three automakers are linked by a complicated share-holding structure under which Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, and Nissan holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, with no voting rights. Nissan holds a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors.Since Ghosn's arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault.Ghosn's arrest has also put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.Ghosn is being held in the spartan Tokyo Detention Center, a tower-like structure in the eastern part of Tokyo, over New Year in addition to Christmas.The detention center, with its many rules and restrictions, makes for a stark contrast with his comfortable, globe-trotting lifestyle.($1 = 110.4500 yen)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

301,"Dec 28, 2018 01:23AM ET",Nissan to make fewer cars in China in months ahead as demand slows: source,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) will produce 30,000 fewer vehicles in the coming months in China than what it had planned, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters, as global automakers grapple with falling demand in the world's biggest car market.After  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), Nissan becomes the latest automaker to cut production in the country, where slowing economic growth and a crippling trade war with the United States have pummeled vehicle sales in the past few months.Nissan plans to cut production in China by a total of 30,000 units during the December-February period from its initial output plans, said the person who declined to be identified as the plans are not public.Automakers set initial plans on how many vehicles to produce at each of their plants. These plans can be modified due to demand, supply chain issues and other factors. It was not known how much Nissan had planned to produce in the three months.The automaker produced nearly 400,000 units in the country during the three-month period ended February this year. The period covers the first two months of the year, when sales usually slow in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holidays.Japan's Nikkei business daily reported late on Thursday that Nissan plans to cut production at three plants in China, including one in Dalian, where it produces the popular Qashqai and Infiniti QX50 SUV crossover models, and in Zhengzhou, where it makes the X-Trail SUV crossover, one of its top-selling models, and Venucia brand models. A Nissan spokeswoman in Beijing declined on Friday to comment on future production plans.China is Nissan's second-largest market, accounting for roughly one-quarter of its annual global vehicle sales. It sold 1.5 million vehicles in China last year, and earlier this year said it planned to boost sales to 2.6 million units by 2022, making China its biggest market in terms of vehicle sales.But a stretch of booming demand for cars in China seems to have come to an end, with the market on track to post a fall in annual sales for the first time since at least 1990. Nissan's group sales in China rose 3.9 percent in the January-November period, slowing from a 12 percent jump a year ago.A slowdown in the major market comes at a time when the Japanese automaker is grappling with a scandal involving alleged financial misconduct of Carlos Ghosn, leading to his arrest and subsequent ouster as chairman, and straining ties with French automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

302,"Dec 27, 2018 01:55PM ET",Renault union calls for more transparency over Dutch holding,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's CGT union has called for more transparency at  Renault  (PA:RENA) and its Dutch holding company and asked the French government, one of the carmaker's shareholders, to try to shed light on its workings, a CGT representative said on Thursday. Renault, and its alliance with Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), has been in the spotlight after the partnership's architect Carlos Ghosn was arrested in mid-November in Japan amid allegations his Nissan income was understated. The CGT wrote to French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire in early December questioning the way Renault had handled the affair and to denounce a lack of transparency at RNBV, a joint Renault-Nissan holding company based in the Netherlands, FranceInfo reported on Thursday. A CGT spokesman confirmed the union had reached out to Le Maire and to Renault's deputy CEO Thierry Bollore, adding it was calling for clarity on additional wage payments made via RNBV to an unidentified member of the French carmaker's executive committee. ""Workers have no information about RNBV,"" the CGT spokesman said. Spokesmen for Le Maire and for Renault declined to comment. The French state owns 15 percent of Renault. Executives from both carmakers in the Renault-Nissan alliance looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through the partners' shared finances, including via RNBV, Reuters reported earlier in December.The two efforts discussed were ultimately abandoned. Ghosn, who remains Renault's chairman and chief executive but was ousted as Nissan's chairman, has been in a Tokyo jail since mid-November.

303,"Dec 26, 2018 03:30PM ET",Exclusive: New allegations against Ghosn concern payments to Saudi businessman - sources,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - Fresh misconduct allegations brought by Tokyo prosecutors against ousted Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn center on the use of company funds to pay a Saudi businessman who is believed to have helped him out of financial difficulties, two company sources with knowledge of the matter said.Prosecutors arrested Ghosn for a third time on Friday, accusing him of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to the automaker. The prosecutors' statement said they believe that around October 2008, Ghosn was trying to deal with losses on paper of 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) incurred on a swap contract he had with a bank which it did not name.A person helped arrange a letter of credit for Ghosn and a company run by the person later received $14.7 million in Nissan funds in four installments between 2009 and 2012, the statement said, adding that the payments were made in Ghosn's and the person's interests. ""By doing so, (Ghosn) behaved in a way that breached trust, and inflicted damage on the property of Nissan,"" the statement said. The statement also said Ghosn had earlier sought to have Nissan shoulder the appraisal losses directly.According to the Nissan sources who have knowledge of the company's probe into its former chief, the person who helped Ghosn is Khaled Al-Juffali, vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia's largest conglomerates, E. A. Juffali and Brothers, and a member of the board at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority.He is also majority owner of a company called Al-Dahana which owns half of a regional joint venture called Nissan Gulf with the other half held by a wholly owned unit of Nissan Motor.Sheikh Khaled Juffali has no comment on this subject, according to an emailed statement from E. A. Juffali and Brothers.Ghosn's Tokyo-based lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, was unavailable for comment on this article, according to a person who answered the phone at his law office. A representative for the Ghosn family declined to comment.Other media have said Ghosn has through a lawyer denied that he shifted losses to Nissan and has told investigators that the four payments were for legitimate business purposes, including a reward for handling problems at Nissan dealers in Saudi Arabia. Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment. Asked about Ghosn's reported comments, a Nissan spokesman said: ""We cannot comment on matters related to Ghosn's arrest for breach of trust. Nissan's own investigation is ongoing, and its scope continues to broaden.""'PROSECUTORS KNOW MORE'Ghosn's re-arrest – the latest twist in a saga that has jolted Nissan' alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) – came a day after a Tokyo court unexpectedly rejected a request from prosecutors to extend Ghosn's detention. Unlike his previous arrests on allegations of under-reporting his compensation which he faced together with former representative director Greg Kelly, prosecutors have leveled these latest accusations against Ghosn only.The Nissan sources with knowledge of the matter said the automaker's investigators concluded that Ghosn was unsuccessful in his attempt to have Nissan shoulder the losses directly. Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission had at some stage flagged Ghosn's attempt to have Nissan directly shoulder the losses as illegal, one of the sources said. It was not immediately clear what the SESC deemed illegal. A SESC spokesman said he could not comment on specific cases.The sources declined to be identified as the results of Nissan's internal investigation have not been made public yet.Ghosn then gained help from Al-Juffali who used his personal assets to provide collateral for a bank to issue a letter of credit that Tokyo-based Shinsei Bank had required of Ghosn, the sources said. A spokesman for Shinsei said he could not comment on specific cases. Reuters was not able to determine the identity of the bank which issued the letter of credit.The four payments arranged by Ghosn were made through a Nissan internal discretionary fund, known within the company as the 'CEO Reserve', to a Nissan unit which then paid a company owned by Al-Juffali, one of the sources said, without specifying the names of the companies.The first payment of $3 million was made in fiscal 2009, followed by payments of $3.6 million, $3.9 million and $4.2 million in the three subsequent years, the sources added.The sources said the Nissan investigators initially had not been looking at the transactions with the urgency prosecutors displayed last week.""Prosecutors know more about this than we do,"" one of the sources said.E. A. Juffali and Brothers was founded in 1946. The company set up electric power supply and telecommunications to some of Saudi Arabia's major cities and expanded into construction, insurance, vehicle manufacturing and distribution. Established in October 2008, the Nissan Gulf joint venture was originally responsible for Nissan's marketing and sales strategy and dealer development in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Bahrain but the scope of the business has since been reduced to Kuwait and Bahrain for reasons that weren't immediately clear, one of the sources said.Kelly was released on bail late on Christmas day but Ghosn remains in detention. After the latest allegations, prosecutors were granted permission to hold him for 10 days on Dec. 23 and will typically ask for another 10 days, which is usually approved.Japanese prosecutors often arrest individuals repeatedly on different allegations linked to the same case. The practice allows them to hold suspects while they pursue their investigation and also means they can continue interrogations without the presence of a lawyer.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He posted bail of 70 million yen ($640,000).Their Nov. 19 arrests jolted the global car industry and has strained Nissan's (T:7201) alliance with French car maker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Nissan's board last month fired Ghosn as chairman and Kelly as representative director, although both men technically still remain board members who can only be removed by shareholders.Kelly suffers from spinal stenosis, causing numbness, tingling and shooting pain in his extremities, according to a video message last week from his wife, Dee Kelly, appealing for his release. The condition compresses or pinches the spinal cord.Those symptoms worsened during his five weeks in the Tokyo Detention Center, his wife said, citing Kelly's lawyer. Kelly was scheduled to have surgery on Dec. 7 in Nashville, Tennessee, but flew to Japan last month after being told that he was needed in person at a board meeting, Dee Kelly said in the video. Kelly was arrested soon after his arrival.Under the conditions of his bail, Kelly is barred from traveling overseas and his residence must be restricted to a designated place, the Tokyo District Court said. Lawyers say that travel exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis.Kelly walked out of the detention center around 10:45 pm (1345 GMT) Thursday night wearing a light-colored jacket and was whisked away in a black taxi. Japanese media showed footage of Kelly entering a hospital around midnight. After his release from detention, Kelly issued a statement through his lawyer saying he had not falsified any documents and looked forward to restoring his honor in court. ""I believe my innocence will be revealed in the trial,"" he said.Kelly also said in the statement he wanted to see a doctor immediately and get the appropriate treatment or operation originally scheduled for early December.The office of his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, did not respond to requests for comment.Ghosn was re-arrested on Friday based on suspicions that around October 2008 he shifted personal trades to Nissan to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, prosecutors said.Prosecutors also said Ghosn had inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account.Ghosn said through his lawyer that he was not guilty of the allegations, for which he has not been formally charged.

The arrests jolted the global car industry and strained Nissan's alliance with French car maker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Ghosn remains in custody. A crowd of Japanese and international reporters and camera crews had gathered since Tuesday morning waiting for Kelly's release. He left the Tokyo Detention Center with his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, by taxi at around 10:45 p.m. (1345 GMT), a Reuters witness said.

There was no answer at Kitamura's office when contacted by Reuters for comment. The ruling by the Tokyo District Court came after an appeal by Kelly's family in Tennessee. He paid bail of 70 million yen ($640,000) in cash, the court said.But he could be barred from leaving Japan or talking to people related to the case, NHK said earlier in the day, although exceptions can be made for overseas travel on a case-by-case basis.Kelly's wife, Dee Kelly, appealed for his release in a video statement last week, saying her husband had been ""wrongly accused as part of a power grab by several Nissan executives"", that he and Ghosn ""fully believe that they did not break the law"" and citing her husband's need for surgery for spinal stenosis.A Nissan spokesman said the car maker was not in a position to comment on the latest twist in the more-than-month-long saga.""The company's own investigation uncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct, resulting in a unanimous board vote to dismiss Ghosn and Kelly as chairman and representative director.

The Tokyo prosecutor said the fresh arrest was based on suspicions that around October 2008, Ghosn shifted personal trades to the automaker to make it responsible for 1.85 billion yen ($16.6 million) in appraisal losses, and inflicted damage on Nissan by having it deposit a total of $14.7 million on four occasions between June 2009 and March 2012 into a related bank account. His lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, was not available for comment. Otsuru has previously declined to return calls about the Ghosn case.Kyodo news agency said that when the allegation that Ghosn had shifted the paper losses first surfaced in media reports late last month, Otsuru said his client had denied it.Ghosn had considered the move but did not do so after being told by financial authorities that it would be illegal, Kyodo quoted Otsuru as saying then.""RESTORE MY HONOR""Also on Friday, the Tokyo court said in a statement that the lawyer for Ghosn's former deputy Greg Kelly, who was arrested along with Ghosn, has requested his client's release. Kelly's detention extension was rejected along with Ghosn's.The lawyer, Yohei Kitamura, later told Reuters that Kelly was unlikely to be released before Tuesday because there was not enough time to complete procedures, including the payment of any bail that might be set.The dramatic turn of events came hours after Ghosn, through his lawyer and quoted by Japanese public broadcaster NHK, vowed to restore his good name in court and to hold a news conference after his release.""Things as they stand are absolutely unacceptable,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I want to have my position heard and restore my honor in court.""Television camera crews had gathered outside the Tokyo jail on Friday morning in hopes of catching sight of Ghosn being released.Ghosn was initially arrested on Nov. 19 for allegedly understating his income by about half over a five-year period from 2010. He was later re-arrested for a similar alleged crime covering the past three years.The maximum penalty for both understating compensation and the latest accusation - aggravated breach of trust - is up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of 10 million yen.Nissan said after his initial arrest that it unearthed multiple instances of possible wrongdoing in an internal investigation triggered by a whistleblower. The internal probe is ongoing, and has included allegations of diverting company funds to pay for personal expenses. Sources have told Reuters that investigators have been looking into the use of an internal ""CEO Reserve"" fund and the role of overseas subsidiaries in alleged financial misconduct.DOWNFALLThe Ghosn case has put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.The case also marked a dramatic fall for the leader of the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) alliance who was once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has since called for changes to weaken the clout of controlling shareholder Renault.Documents seen by Reuters showed that some discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye were not confined to Nissan, but also included Renault executives.While Nissan ousted Ghosn from his role as chairman shortly after the initial arrest, Renault has so far not replaced him.A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on the re-arrest, saying only that the internal investigation was ongoing and expanding into new areas. Renault declined to comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

308,"Dec 20, 2018 05:39AM ET",Tokyo prosecutors appeal after court decides against extending Ghosn detention,nan,"By Kiyoshi TakenakaTOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo prosecutors have appealed a court decision that prevents further detention of Carlos Ghosn, a surprise ruling which could free the ousted chairman of Nissan Motor Co Ltd for the first time since his arrest for alleged financial misconduct.The Tokyo District Court on Thursday also decided against extending the detention of Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive who was arrested along with Ghosn on Nov. 19.There is no set timing for a decision on the appeal, but an appeal defense lawyers lodged previously to prevent the executives' re-arrest was rejected in about three hours.Late on Thursday, a man resembling Ghosn's lawyer Motonari Otsuru entered the tower-like Tokyo Detention Center where Ghosn and Kelly are held, passing a crowd of waiting camera crews, a Reuters journalist reported from the scene. The man did not make any comments. Kelly's lawyer was not available for comment.The executives have not been able to make any public statements since their initial arrest, though local media have reported that both men have denied wrongdoing.Ghosn led Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). He was indicted on Dec. 10 for allegedly understating his income by about half over a five-year period from 2010, and re-arrested the same day for the same alleged crime covering the past three years. The 10-day detention period in the second instance ran out on Thursday.The court had widely been expected to extend the detention for at least another 10 days, as granting bail to suspects who insist on their innocence has until recently been unusual in Japan. It did not disclose reasons for its decision.The high-profile case has put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny and sparked criticism for some of its practices, including keeping suspects in detention for long periods and prohibiting defense lawyers from being present during interrogations, which can last eight hours a day.The court's decision could reflect sensitivity to that criticism as well as changing attitudes in the courts, said Masashi Akita, a defense lawyer in Osaka with over 30 years' experience.""They are very nervous about criticism of their lenient approach toward detention. This is a typical case of such changing, I suppose,"" Akita said in emailed responses to Reuters' questions. ""I think this case has a big impact and effect on the Japanese justice practice, and such a move is favorable for the defense side.""Public broadcaster NHK said Ghosn could be released on Thursday or Friday if any appeal by prosecutors is rejected by the court and bail is granted. However, Akita said it could take until the middle of next week for all procedures to run their course - if indeed the men are freed.BAIL AMOUNTSGhosn's arrest marked a dramatic fall for a leader once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy.Accustomed to a globe-trotting lifestyle, Ghosn has been detained in a small room without a heater and a toilet in the corner. Authorities have limited his opportunities to shower and shave, a person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.It was not immediately clear how much bail would be, or if would even be granted.Activist fund manager Yoshiaki Murakami, arrested in 2006 for insider trading, paid an initial 500 million yen ($4.47 million) in bail.At the center of allegations against Ghosn is his Nissan income, with Tokyo prosecutors charging the executive for failing to disclose compensation that he had arranged to receive later.Nissan has said a whistleblower investigation also uncovered personal use of company funds and other misconduct.The scandal has shaken the Nissan-Mitsubishi-Renault alliance, with Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken the clout of Renault SA, which owns a controlling stake in Nissan.Renault has so far not replaced Ghosn as its head, saying his compensation had been in compliance with law and governance guidelines.Documents seen by Reuters showed that some discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye were not confined to Nissan, but also included Renault executives. Renault told Reuters that any such pay would have had to be made public in France.Nissan on Thursday said Saikawa earlier this week held a one-on-one meeting with Renault acting boss Thierry Bollore, saying Saikawa described the meeting as ""positive"". It did not disclose details of the discussions.Nissan declined to comment on the court's decision.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

309,"Dec 19, 2018 08:17AM ET",Exclusive: Renault-Nissan finances draw scrutiny in Ghosn scandal - documents,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Ritsuko AndoPARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201) executives including the French carmaker's general secretary Mouna Sepehri worked on an abortive 2010 plan to pay out part of Chairman Carlos Ghosn's Nissan compensation through the companies' Dutch holding Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV), according to documents seen by Reuters.Ghosn's undisclosed Nissan income is at the center of allegations by Tokyo prosecutors against the alliance's boss, who has been charged in Japan with failing to declare $43 million in compensation for the years 2010-15 that he had arranged to be paid later. Renault  declined to make Sepehri available for comment on the proposed scheme.Ghosn and Greg Kelly, his fellow Nissan director and alleged accomplice, are still in custody and have had little opportunity to defend themselves in public. Ghosn, who remains Renault's chairman and chief executive, denies that the pay deals broke any laws, his Japanese lawyer has told other media.In an April 22, 2010 email to Sepehri and one other recipient, Kelly wrote: ""I greatly appreciate the work you have done to analyze whether part of the CEO's compensation can be paid by RNBV without disclosing it publicly.""In a written response to Reuters, Renault said Kelly had ""consulted several people at Renault and Nissan to establish whether it was legally possible that part of the CEO's compensation be paid by RNBV to reflect the time he spent working on alliance synergies.""In 2017, as Ghosn's deferred-income IOUs were piling up, Renault-Nissan bankers developed plans to channel millions of euros in additional, undisclosed bonuses to Ghosn and other alliance managers via a Dutch service company.Among executives included in emails and meetings on the bonus plan were Renault deputy CEO Thierry Bollore and Sepehri, as well as Hiroto Saikawa, now Nissan's CEO, according to documents seen by Reuters.Renault said its executives had not led the project, but confirmed that financial adviser Ardea Partners, which drew it up, had held ""exchanges with some Renault and Nissan executives, including Mr Saikawa, Mr Bollore and Ms Sepehri.""A June 13 Reuters report revealing the plan was denied by Ghosn at Renault's shareholder meeting two days later. The plan was dropped soon after that, invoices and emails show. The companies declined to make any of the executives available for comment.Nissan, which is pressing Renault for a joint investigation of alliance finances, also wants to re-examine a recent decision to create a new alliance foundation in Switzerland.In a Sept. 26 resolution, the Renault-Nissan board signed off on a 30 million-euro ($34 million) transfer to the organization, documents show. But the transfer was canceled after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan, two sources said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The meeting between Nissan (T:7201) CEO Hiroto Saikawa and Renault (PA:RENA) deputy CEO Thierry Bollore is their first since Ghosn's Nov. 19 detention over financial misconduct allegations.Renault, Nissan and alliance spokespeople all declined to comment on the gathering in Amsterdam, beyond confirming that Saikawa would attend. No announcements are planned.The sit-down comes a day after Saikawa rebuffed Renault's demand for an early shareholder meeting that would have offered the French carmaker a chance to weigh in on Ghosn's replacement as Nissan chairman and on other board appointments at its Japanese partner.Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan, in turn, controls Mitsubishi (T:7211) via a 34 percent holding.Ghosn was charged in Japan last week alongside alleged accomplice Greg Kelly and Nissan itself over their failure to declare $43 million in deferred income that Ghosn had arranged to be paid while chairman and CEO of the Japanese firm. Both men remain in custody and have had limited opportunity to respond to the allegations or defend themselves publicly.The scandal has shaken the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, with Saikawa calling for changes to weaken Renault's control as he moved to oust Ghosn in the week of his arrest.Saikawa planned to discuss changes in alliance management with Bollore, sources familiar with the matter said - including a new leadership troika in which the three companies would be equal partners. Under current agreements, Renault ultimately controls the alliance board. A meeting last month failed to name an interim leader for the partnership.The Amsterdam talks could also provide Saikawa with an opportunity to convince Renault executives of the gravity of Ghosn's alleged misconduct, discovered during an in-house investigation by the Japanese automaker. Top managers from across the alliance will be present for scheduled monthly operational sessions.The broader meetings will discuss difficulties that have arisen within some alliance vehicle and powertrain programs since the scandal erupted, one source said.Renault directors were briefed last week on the Nissan investigation that led to Ghosn's arrest but reiterated their earlier decision to keep him in office as the French carmaker's chairman and CEO, while temporarily delegating his executive role to Bollore.But the Renault board has yet to be given direct access to Nissan's findings, which are being closely held by Renault lawyers answering to Ghosn's long-standing chief of staff and head of legal affairs at Renault, Mouna Sepehri.""We understand that the raw details of the misconduct have yet to reach each of Renault's board members,"" Saikawa said on Monday after Nissan directors rebuffed the shareholder meeting demand. ""We hope the board will listen to our explanation.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

311,"Dec 17, 2018 09:06PM ET",Yearender: Hamilton and Mercedes shift from fourth to fifth,nan,"By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes won their fifth Formula One championships in 2018 but, even if nothing actually changed at the top, the season at least added an exciting twist to the same old story.Yes, the top three -- the 'Silver Arrows' along with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Red Bull -- again won all the races, just as they have for the past five years.And yes, their drivers also filled all but one of the 63 podium places in what was more than ever a two-tier championship.At the front, however, the fight for supremacy was far closer, with the outcome far from clear and Mercedes having to wait until the fourth race to open their win account.Ferrari won six, their best effort since 2008 but still some way short of what might have been, and were hit hard by the death mid-season of combative chairman Sergio Marchionne and their own mistakes.Red Bull ended their  Renault  (PA:RENA) partnership with four victories, their biggest haul since 2013 when they were last champions, to set new engine suppliers Honda a high benchmark for 2019.Hamilton moved onto another level, however.His success, with 11 wins from 21 races and 11 poles, was all the more impressive given that Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel could claim to have the faster car for at least the first half of the season.Unlike Vettel and Ferrari, Hamilton barely put a wheel wrong as he equaled the late Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio's five titles, with only Michael Schumacher ahead on seven.The highlights included storming from 14th on the grid to victory in Germany, while Vettel skidded off as he led in the wet, and an astonishing pole position lap in Singapore.The 33-year-old Briton staged an epic recovery from last to second at Silverstone, and ended the year on 73 wins with Schumacher's all-time record of 91 coming into range.""I've grown, I've understood myself more,"" Hamilton said when asked what he had learned from a year that left Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas winless, mentally battered and bruised.""I've just been able to be a better me all year long and that's never going to stop.""Hamilton's continuing reign was echoed elsewhere in motorsport, with Spaniard Marc Marquez collecting his fifth MotoGP crown while Frenchman Sebastien Ogier went one better to end a closely-fought rally championship as a six-times champion. HEFTY PUSHFormula One's youth revolution continued, with fresh faces lined up for 2019 as teams gave the driver merry-go-round a hefty push.Only Mercedes and fifth-placed Haas will be carrying unchanged line-ups into 2019, also a crucial year off the track with commercial rights holders Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA) facing tough discussions over the sport's future direction.Another, very real, shove landed Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who turned 21 and delighted Dutch fans with two race wins in 2018, in hot water after an altercation with Force India's Esteban Ocon.Sauber's Charles Leclerc was rookie of the year and the exciting young Monegasque will begin a new chapter at Ferrari next year, trading places with 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen -- who won in Texas for his first victory in 113 races.Double world champion Fernando Alonso called it a day, leaving as one of the greats but with McLaren still agonizingly slow and ushering out racing director Eric Boullier among others.Alonso will now chase the Indianapolis 500, and Triple Crown glory, after winning the Le Mans 24 Hours with Toyota at the first attempt in 2018.The return of the French Grand Prix after a 10-year absence was a popular comeback, the traffic jams around Le Castellet much less so as fans fumed in tailbacks for hours.New faces coming in for 2019 will include Britain's Formula Two champion George Russell, at Williams (NYSE:WMB), and teenage compatriot Lando Norris at McLaren.Australian Daniel Ricciardo will also have a new team after leaving Red Bull for Renault -- now the sport's fourth-ranked team.Force India who had previously been best-of-the-rest, went into administration and emerged under the new ownership of a Canadian consortium led by Lance Stroll's billionaire father Lawrence.In the year's least surprising move, Stroll junior moved from Williams -- the former champions now 10th and last -- to his father's team for 2019.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The once-revered boss of Nissan was officially charged in a Tokyo court last week and remains in detention. The Japanese automaker was also indicted for its role in the scandal.Nissan's board is set to boost the number of external board members and set up a committee to oversee compensation, the source said. Critics have said Nissan lacked adequate governance, with few truly independent voices on the board capable of questioning leadership and looking out for regular shareholders' interests.Its current three external board members include retired Renault executive Jean-Baptiste Duzan, considered to represent the views of the French automaker which is Nissan's biggest shareholder. The other two external board members are former bureaucrat Masakazu Toyoda and racing car driver Keiko Ihara.Nissan is 43.4 percent owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in the French firm.

Renault directors have yet to be given access to Nissan's findings, which are being closely held by Renault lawyers.The call for a shareholder meeting will likely be seen as an attempted show of force by Renault's interim management, led by Bollore and Mouna Sepehri, Ghosn's long-standing chief of staff who also heads legal affairs and communications.The board of Mitsubishi Motors, which is the third member in the alliance, is also meeting on Monday, the sources said.

""We are unable to comment on the specifics of the ongoing investigation at this time,"" he said.Ghosn has denied wrongdoing, according to media reports. His lawyer in Tokyo, Motonari Otsuru, was unavailable for comment on this article, according to a person who answered the phone at his law office. In response to questions from Reuters about the CEO Reserve fund and other issues, two Ghosn representatives in the United States said they were unable to comment because they were not sufficiently familiar with the details.Nissan fired Ghosn as chairman on Nov. 26, a week after he was arrested by Japanese prosecutors, accused of conspiring to understate his compensation by about half of the 10 billion yen ($88 million) awarded over five years from 2010. He was indicted this week and remains in detention.Until recently one of the auto industry's most celebrated executives, Ghosn was seen as the anchor of Nissan's alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He has since been fired as chairman of Mitsubishi although Renault has stopped short of dismissing him from its helm.SPLIT PAYMENTSOne focus of the probe is whether payments for the multi-million dollar residences were split by associates close to Ghosn into one million dollar chunks and then processed through a Nissan unit in the Netherlands called Zi-A Capital BV and its subsidiaries, which had been set up to invest in tech startups, one of the people said.Reuters was not able to verify who was in charge of making the payments.Done that way, the transactions may have escaped the attention of finance people within Nissan, Nissan's auditors and employees affiliated with the Nissan-Renault alliance, the people said.""Why would (internal financial staff) go in and check one-million-dollar transactions in a subsidiary five, six levels or layers down and away from the global headquarters? They wouldn't do that,"" one individual familiar with the inquiry said. ""Especially when amounts are less than one million dollars,"" the individual said. Ghosn's legal defense partly rests on the assertion that his compensation arrangements were vetted internally and by outside consultants, people familiar with the matter said. They did not identify the Nissan staff and external consultants who were in charge of the vetting.The former Nissan chairman is prepared to argue that properties spanning cities across the globe were purchased by Nissan as corporate housing, these people said.His co-defendant, former representative director Greg Kelly, who has been accused by prosecutors of conspiring with Ghosn about his compensation, has denied the allegations. Kelly's lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said he was unaware of the content of Nissan's internal probe and was confident his client will be cleared of the charges brought against him.Zi-A Capital BV was registered in the Netherlands as a company by Nissan Motor on Dec. 10 2010 with Kelly and Ghosn named as two of four directors at the time. Ghosn, who was also CEO, left as a director on Nov. 2, 2011, according to a company profile available with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.The role of two of Zi-A Capital BV's subsidiaries, Zi-A Capital Ltd in Dubai and Hamsa Holdings Ltd in the British Virgin Islands, are also being checked by investigators, one of the people with knowledge of the probe said. Zi-A Capital BV is currently wholly owned by Nissan Motor Parts Center BV in the Netherlands, which is a unit of Nissan Automotive Europe SAS in France, which in turn is a wholly owned unit of Yokohama-based Nissan Motor.Since investments in technology startups are generally considered confidential, the subsidiaries did not attract much attention from internal financial staff, the sources with knowledge of the probe said.Nissan's auditor, Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, questioned the automaker's management several times, chiefly around 2013, about purchases of overseas luxury homes for Ghosn’s personal use and of stock-appreciation rights that were conferred on him, a person with direct knowledge of the matter has said. But the Japanese automaker said the transactions and financial reporting were appropriate, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Nissan declined to comment. A representative for Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC could not immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for the auditor has previously said he could not comment on specific cases when asked about the matter.POTATO CHIPS The CEO Reserve was set up to pay for unplanned business needs and could at times contain 'a few hundred million dollars', one of the people with knowledge of the inquiry said. ""For example, if you have an autonomous drive company you'd want to buy right now, you'd use that budget,"" the second person with knowledge of the matter said.According to one of the people, the team is reviewing ""a mountain"" of receipts and other financial records to see if purchases of residences in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut and Paris as well as expenses such as a yacht club membership and a donation to a college had been approved and paid for properly.One of the apartments in Rio de Janeiro has been the subject of a heated legal dispute between Nissan and Ghosn, with Nissan losing a battle to block Ghosn and his family from accessing the apartment. Nissan had argued that access could result in the destruction of evidence of crimes.Ghosn used the CEO Reserve to also pay for family vacation trips, utilities and even potato chips, one of the people with knowledge of the probe said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

319,"Dec 13, 2018 07:11PM ET",Exclusive: France plans Renault CEO hunt as board frays over Ghosn - sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - The French government is seeking candidates to replace Renault's (PA:RENA) embattled boss Carlos Ghosn, sources told Reuters, as board members began to voice doubts about keeping him in office following his indictment in Japan for suspected misconduct.At a meeting on Thursday,  Renault  directors were briefed on an investigation by alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) that led to Ghosn's arrest last month. He was charged this week over the company's failure to declare $43 million in deferred income he had arranged to receive.Nissan fired Ghosn as chairman three days after his detention, but Renault has resisted pressure to dismiss him, as the scandal strains their carmaking alliance.The Renault board on Thursday stuck by its earlier decision to keep him on, with its lead director standing in as interim chairman and deputy CEO Thierry Bollore leading operations.In a statement issued by Renault after the meeting, the board ""noted that, at this stage, it does not have information concerning Carlos Ghosn's defense.""During the five-hour session, however, several directors led by Cherie Blair, wife of the British former prime minister Tony Blair, began to express impatience with that position, two people with knowledge of the matter said.""What she said, in effect, was that we can't remain in this situation forever,"" one source said of Blair. ""At some point you need to move forward and move on.""A Renault spokesman said he could not comment on board proceedings. Cherie Blair could not immediately be reached for comment.SHORTLISTFrench officials have already begun listing possible candidates to replace Ghosn as CEO, three sources close to the company said. Senior Toyota executive Didier Leroy will be considered, one said.""There's nothing official yet but the government is working on a lineup,"" he said. ""They're ready to turn the page.""A finance ministry official declined to comment. The government, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake and two board seats, typically plays a major role in succession planning.""I have no comment on speculation, and I am 100 percent concentrated on my job at Toyota,"" Leroy told Reuters.The boardroom crisis has shaken the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken the French parent's control.Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan in turn controls Mitsubishi via a 34 percent holding.Blair's board intervention was echoed during the meeting by two other independent directors as well as Renault staff representatives, two sources said - with some also voicing misgivings over management's handling of the crisis.BOARD COUNSELAt the risk of worsening tensions, Bollore instructed Nissan to refrain from contacting Renault directors ahead of the meeting, Reuters reported on Tuesday, as the Japanese carmaker sought to share its findings.Directors had also clashed with Renault managers over their right to hire independent board counsel with access to Nissan's findings, two other people said. Company attorneys answering to Mouna Sepehri - who doubles as board secretary and head of Ghosn's CEO office - have so far declined to share the report with directors or their lawyers, citing the secrecy of the investigation.Under French government pressure, Ghosn had been exploring a deeper tie-up or even a full merger between the alliance partners, despite strong reservations at Nissan.Whether or not they broke the law, Ghosn's undisclosed compensation plans - doubling his total Nissan package for the five years to March 2015 - are politically sensitive in France, where President Emmanuel Macron has been battling protests.Defence arguments advanced by Ghosn's lawyers and supporters have not contested the plans' existence. His Japanese lawyer Motonari Otsuru said in a media statement that the pay agreements had not been properly ratified.Nissan has said its whistleblower investigation also uncovered personal use of company funds and other misconduct, detailed in the report shared with Renault lawyers this week.Renault, which launched an audit into its own payments to Ghosn after his arrest, said on Thursday its ""preliminary conclusion"" was that his compensation had been ""in compliance with applicable law"" and governance guidelines.Ghosn and an alleged accomplice, Nissan director Greg Kelly, remain in custody and have had limited opportunity to respond to the allegations or defend themselves, particularly in public.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The other two external board members are former bureaucrat Masakazu Toyoda and racing car driver Keiko Ihara. Ghosn was indicted on Monday under-reporting his income. The company also cited multiple instances of financial misconduct including personal use of company assets. Ghosn's detention has left the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi auto alliance without its leader.Nissan is 43.4 percent owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in the French firm.

While Nissan fired him as chairman days after his arrest, he remains chairman and CEO of its French partner.Renault's board meets on Dec. 13, and the findings of Nissan's investigation will be shared at the meeting where Ghosn's future could be also debated, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said.The French firm told Nissan not to contact its directors ahead of the meeting, because such contact was outside the agreed channels for communication of the sensitive findings, the source said.Nissan offered last week to brief Renault's board about findings on what it considers proof of wrongdoing by Ghosn, said a second source who has knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as it was confidential.But Renault advised Nissan to brief its lawyers instead, which led to a meeting between the Japanese firm's officials and Renault's legal teams early this week in Paris, the person said.The Japanese automaker later invited Thierry Bollore, who was named Renault's deputy CEO with the same powers as Ghosn a day after his arrest, as well as board members, to examine the contents of the findings, said the source. Bollore, though, told Nissan on Tuesday to ""refrain from contacting the board"", the source said.The exchange between Renault and Nissan is another example of the testy relationship between the two automakers, despite assurances by executives on both sides to preserve the alliance. The alliance, of which Ghosn has been the driving force, is widely seen as vital for the members' long-term survival.Board members invited to see the evidence included Martin Vial, who heads the French state shareholdings agency, interim Chairman Philippe Lagayette and independent director Patrick Thomas, the second source said.A Renault spokesperson declined to comment.

Renault's board meets on Thursday Dec. 13 amid mounting pressure to dismiss Ghosn as chairman and chief executive. Ghosn's declared salaries at Renault and Nissan have been politically sensitive in France, where President Emmanuel Macron is now battling street protests that have shaken his government.Macron and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire had issued calls for Nissan to share findings from its months-long investigation.""We're not going to propose that Mr. Ghosn step down for the simple reason that we don't have any evidence,"" Le Maire said on Nov. 21, two days after the car executive's surprise arrest.Nissan, which ousted Ghosn the same week, finally communicated its 400-page dossier on Ghosn's alleged misconduct to its 43.4 percent-owner Renault via lawyers on Monday, French daily Les Echos and other media reported. A Renault spokesman would not confirm reception of the Nissan findings.LEGAL CHANNELSFrench officials acknowledged that the dossier had been received by Renault, however - while maintaining that the government remained unaware of its content.Renault had requested that the findings be shared under a strict legal procedure that ""required the agreement of the Japanese prosecutor"", a government source said.""For the moment we don't have the detailed contents of these documents so we can't take a position.""The French finance ministry declined to comment.France holds a 15 percent stake in Renault and two board seats.

His Japanese lawyer Motonari Otsuru said in a media statement that the compensation agreements had not been properly ratified.Ghosn's defense partly rests on the contention that his deferred compensation arrangements were vetted internally and by outside consultants, people familiar with the matter said.Pressure for his formal dismissal from Renault appeared to be growing in the wake of the Japanese indictments.Officials from two centrist Renault unions, the CFDT and CFE-CGC, are privately urging management to replace Ghosn permanently, sources said - joining the leftist CGT, which was quick to call for leadership change after his arrest.""Whether or not he's found guilty, his image among staff is so tarnished that I can't imagine him returning to his post,"" said an official with one of the moderate labor groupings.""It's not easy to oust him without appearing to prejudge the case - but that's really a communication problem now.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The home could contain evidence of financial misconduct, according to a filing by Nissan in a Brazilian court last week.The legal dispute has been fierce in recent days, showing that Ghosn and Nissan are not just clashing in Japan, where the scandal first broke and where Ghosn was formally charged on Monday, but around the world.Ghosn's family obtained a favorable injunction last week that was then swiftly overturned, but Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported the family obtained another favorable court decision on Monday.A PR representative for Ghosn in Brazil declined to comment. A source at Nissan in Brazil on Monday afternoon said the Ghosn family still does not have access to the apartment.The previously unreported court papers seen by Reuters show the extent of the legal dispute between Ghosn and Nissan over access to the apartment, one of several around the world he has been able to use. Nissan alleges Ghosn, who had been hailed for bringing the company back from the brink of bankruptcy, underreported his income by tens of millions of dollars and diverted corporate funds for personal use. The Rio apartment contains three safes that Nissan has yet to open, according to the filings. The carmaker found them when it did an audit of the apartment following Ghosn's firing, the company said. The apartment also has ""designer furniture, artwork and decorative objects,"" it added. The Rio apartment was purchased by a Nissan subsidiary in late 2011 following the carmaker's launch of a factory in the nearby city of Resende.The apartment was bought on expectations that Ghosn's trips to Brazil, where he was born and maintains citizenship, would ""become more constant"" after the factory opened, Nissan said in the filings. The apartment is in the Copacabana neighborhood, on a road directly facing Rio's famous beaches. An apartment in the same building was listed online for 12 million reais ($3.07 million). Monday's indictment in Japan puts the ball back in the court of Nissan's alliance partner,  Renault  (PA:RENA). The French company, which owns a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, is preparing for a Dec. 13 board meeting likely to consider Ghosn's future as its chairman and chief executive.Renault has so far stopped short of dismissing Ghosn while repeatedly demanding access to the findings of the Nissan internal investigation that led to his arrest.""INCALCULABLE RISK""Court proceedings in Brazil started on Nov. 29 when a lawyer for Ghosn asked a judge to grant him access to the Rio apartment.Nissan says allowing him access would ""represent an incalculable risk of destruction of potential evidence of crimes allegedly committed."" So far he has been denied access by Brazil's courts. A lawyer for Ghosn, Jose Roberto de Castro Neves, told Reuters he was unaware of the existence of three safes and that it was ""absurd speculation"" that they may contain evidence of wrongdoing. ""He's a very smart guy,"" de Castro Neves said in a brief phone interview. ""If he had done something wrong, he would never leave it in the apartment.""Tokyo prosecutors on Monday indicted Ghosn for under-reporting his income and also charged the automaker, making Nissan culpable for the alleged financial misconduct, which has shocked the industry. Ghosn was arrested in Japan on Nov. 19 and is being held in a Tokyo jail.Ghosn has not made any statement through his lawyers in Japan but has denied the allegations, according to local media.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

328,"Dec 10, 2018 06:45AM ET","Ghosn, Nissan formally charged in financial misconduct scandal",nan,"By Kiyoshi TakenakaTOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo prosecutors indicted ousted Nissan Motor (T:7201) chairman Carlos Ghosn for under-reporting his income and also officially charged the automaker, making the firm culpable for the financial misconduct scandal that has shocked the industry.Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 on suspicion of conspiring to understate his compensation by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million) over five years from 2010. He has been held in a Tokyo jail since then for questioning, but had not been officially charged until now. Prosecutors re-arrested him on Monday on fresh allegations of understating his income for three more years through March 2018. Nissan, which fired Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest, has said the misconduct was masterminded by the once-celebrated executive with the help of former Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also indicted for the first time on Monday.Ghosn and Kelly have not made any statement through their lawyers, but Japanese media reported that they have denied the allegations. Calls to Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, at his office went unanswered.Nissan, indicted for filing false financial statements, said it takes the charge seriously.""Making false disclosures in annual securities reports greatly harms the integrity of Nissan's public disclosures in the securities markets, and the company expresses its deepest regret,"" it said, adding it will correct past financial reports to include appropriate compensation figures. Japan's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC), said the crime carried a fine of up to 700 million yen ($6.2 million). Analysts and legal experts say it will be difficult for Nissan and its Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa to avoid blame, regardless of whether other executives knew about Ghosn's misconduct or that the company lacked internal controls.""It becomes difficult to overlook Saikawa's role in all of this. That becomes the main focus now,"" prominent lawyer and former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara said.Ghosn, if convicted, faces up to 10 years in prison and/or 10 million yen in fines under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.FALL FROM GRACEGhosn's arrest marks a dramatic fall for a leader once hailed for rescuing Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy. The once-feted executive has been treated like others in detention, held in a small chilly room. Authorities have limited his opportunities to shower and shave, according to a person familiar with the matter. Asked about criticism that Japanese prosecutors often try to force confessions from suspects, deputy prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, Shin Kukimoto, said no such method was being used with Ghosn and Kelly.""Questioning is by no means being conducted in a way that forces confession,"" he told a news conference. ""It's my understanding that both of them are being treated appropriately at the Tokyo Detention Center.""The arrest of Ghosn and Kelly has shaken up the foundations of the Renault-Nissan alliance. While the Japanese automaker has stepped up its offensive against Ghosn, seeking to block access by his representatives to an apartment in Rio de Janeiro citing a risk that the executive may remove or destroy evidence, the European partner has kept him on as its chairman and CEO.The key question is whether and how the ownership structure of the alliance might change. Ghosn, under pressure from the French government, had pushed for a deeper tie-up including a possible full merger between  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan, despite strong reservations at Nissan.Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over the Japanese automaker, which dwarfs Renault in vehicle sales. Renault holds around 43 percent of Nissan, while Nissan has a non-voting 15 percent stake in the French partner.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It said supermarket sales had plunged 35 percent on day one on Nov. 17 and 18 percent on day two, Nov. 24.Last week, sales were down six to 13 percent Monday through Wednesday, picked up slightly on Thursday and Friday, but then fell eight percent again on the third day of nationwide protests on Saturday, it said. During Saturday's disturbances in Paris, tourists were left shocked, with some saying they would cut short their visit.MANY SECTORS AFFECTEDWhen they started, the ""yellow vests"" protests were focused on denouncing a squeeze on household spending brought about by President Emmanuel Macron's taxes on diesel, which he says are necessary to combat climate change and protect the environment.But for the past two weekends there have also been violent demonstrations and clashes with security forces in Paris and other major cities, with protesters calling for Macron to resign. Some call it a revolution against a president who they see as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.Saturday's protests in Paris turned particularly violent, with protesters from the far-right and far-left mixing with the ""yellow vests"" and intent on causing as much damage as possible.The Arc de Triomphe was defaced and avenues off Paris's Champs Elysees were the scene of mass-vandalism.Shops on the Champs Elysees and in the heart of Paris, including the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store and Dior and Chanel boutiques, had their windows smashed. Some others were looted. Prestigious Parisian department stores Printemps and Galeries Lafayette protectively shut their doors on Saturday afternoon.Luxury groups such as SMCP, Hermes and LVMH, which are heavily dependent on foreign tourists visiting Paris during the Christmas season are likely to suffer, said Berenberg analysts in a report.The effect may extend through the holiday season.Hotel industry group UMIH said some Paris hotels were seeing cancellation rates of 20 percent to 50 percent and reservations down 10 percent to 15 percent.""We have received calls from many worried customers and we have reassured them,"" said Carlos Conesa, head concierge at the five-star Napoleon Hotel. ""During the protests, the hotel didn't suffer any damage and most of our guests decided to stay inside and had dinner in our restaurants.""While the violence in downtown Paris stunned the country, waves of protests have also targeted road infrastructure, with a another potential impact on the economy.Vinci Autoroute, France's largest toll-road operator, has seen dozens of road blockades and forced openings of barriers since the protests erupted two weeks ago. Protesters have also damaged infrastructure, a spokesman said.French oil major Total has said 75 of its 2,200 petrol stations have run dry as ""yellow vests"" blockade fuel depots. Car manufacturer  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) said production at a plant in eastern France was disrupted for half a day. It takes almost two weeks to recover disrupted output, it said.Le Maire said both Peugeot and rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) had lost vehicle orders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Macron “reiterated his commitment to preserving the alliance as well as the stability of the group.”Macron and Abe met just hours after Japanese prosecutors extended the detention of Ghosn by up to 10 days, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. He was arrested on Nov. 19 in Japan on accusations of understating his income and misusing company funds. The Franco-Brazilian executive has denied the allegations, according to NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster.The arrest raised questions about the future of the alliance between Renault and Nissan that Ghosn, 64, built and oversaw for almost two decades. The pact gives more weight to Paris than to Tokyo, a long-running source of frustration for the Japanese. Renault is considered a company of “vital importance"" to France by the state secretariat for national security.The French automaker employs almost 50,000 people in France, making it a key part of Macron’s effort to revive his country as an economic power. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, while the Japanese carmaker has 15 percent of Renault, without voting rights.Renault has been happy with the status quo, and has been looking to make it permanent. The effort has been championed by its largest shareholder, the French state. Neither Renault, nor Macron’s government, had any idea that Ghosn was about to be taken into custody last week, two officials with knowledge of the matter said earlier.Before the meeting Friday, an official in Macron’s office had said the French president would tell Abe he wanted more information and greater transparency about the Ghosn probe.Nissan has been eager to equalize power at the alliance level and assert Japanese control over one of the country’s most important companies, according to people familiar with the matter. That’s led to fears on the French side that Ghosn’s arrest may have been orchestrated in what amounts to a coup, a charge Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa has denied.Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., which joined the alliance in 2016, have both ousted Ghosn as chairman since his arrest. Renault has so far kept him on as chairman and chief executive, while appointing Thierry Bollore to run the company on a temporary basis."

Prosecutors have to file charges against Ghosn, 64, by Dec. 10 or arrest him on suspicion of fresh crimes to keep him in custody. Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment.

A few days later, however, Le Maire said on French television that he and Seko had agreed that keeping the alliance's current capital structure was desirable - an agreement the Japanese minister denied making.The Mainichi Shimbun daily reported on Friday that Seko had sent a rare letter of protest to Le Maire for the remarks.Officials at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said they could not immediately comment on the letter. A French finance ministry official said Le Maire's office had no comment.Le Maire's apparent faux pas drew some criticism from Renault staff representatives concerned for the alliance.""The government should know their place and stay there,"" said a union official at the French carmaker. ""This kind of overreaching may be counter-productive.""Ghosn's arrest, including for allegedly under-reporting his income, has triggered new attempts by Nissan to shake off what it considers Renault's outsized control of it, adding to problems at Macron's Elysee.As economy minister, Macron had masterminded the French government's surprise increase of its Renault stake in 2015, raising alarm bells inside Nissan that the Elysee was out to wield more influence over the Japanese company.

However, it’s hard for the fans to truly get excited about a battle for eighth place.""The top three places in the constructors' championship were decided before the season-ender, with Mercedes winning both titles for the fifth year in a row.The rules are being tweaked for 2019, with aerodynamic changes aimed at making it easier for drivers to follow cars and battle on track, ahead of a more substantial overhaul planned for 2021.The top teams are already working hard to limit the impact on performance, however, and have far bigger budgets to play with than the smaller teams.""The down force is basically being set back by a year or more, and we have to compensate,"" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said at the weekend.""But there is a bunch of really, really clever people who are looking at the regulations and trying to find ways of having a lot of down force on the car and I’m curious to see whether those cars are really going to be slower next year or not.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

342,"Nov 28, 2018 07:44AM ET",Seeds of Renault-Nissan crisis sown in Macron's 'raid',nan,"By Laurence Frost and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - The arrest of Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has triggered new attempts by the Japanese carmaker to shake off the control of its French parent - adding to the problems piling up on President Emmanuel Macron's desk in the Elysee Palace.But this one, more than most, may be of Macron's own making.In April 2015, as a 37 year-old economy minister with then-unknown presidential ambitions, Macron ordered a surprise government stake increase in  Renault  (PA:RENA), designed to secure double voting rights for the state. The overnight move profoundly rattled the Japanese end of the Renault-Nissan alliance.In the ensuing eight-month boardroom fight between Macron's ministry and Hiroto Saikawa - Nissan's second-in-command at the time - many now see the seeds of today's crisis.When Ghosn's Gulfstream touched down in Tokyo on Nov. 19, prosecutors were waiting. Nissan, the company he rescued from bankruptcy and had overseen for almost two decades, outlined allegations of financial misconduct against its chairman and said governance had been eroded by Renault's control.Saikawa has since contested Renault's right to appoint executives and directors under the alliance master agreement, in correspondence seen by Reuters. Such fundamental differences now threaten the future of the partnership, which rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota on the global auto industry stage.""President Macron himself has skin in the game,"" Max Warburton, an analyst with New York-based asset manager AllianceBernstein, said this week.""He must recognize that his decision in 2015 to increase the French state's holding in Renault ... likely impacted Japanese perceptions of the alliance and heightened concerns that Nissan was ultimately within the control of the French government.""The Elysee declined to comment, but an adviser said the president had ""no regrets"" about the events of 2015. Macron, who surged to victory in elections last year to became France's youngest president, now finds himself battling street protests and record low approval ratings. The Renault-Nissan crisis may draw more attention to the risks of his bold interventionism, once seen as refreshing.The year before his move on Renault, the government under Socialist President Francois Hollande had passed the Florange law. Named after a steel furnace whose closure became a symbol of decline, it doubled voting rights for long-term investors - chief among them the French state - in any listed companies that did not opt out via a shareholder vote.COURTESY CALLOver several months starting in late 2014, Macron, a former Rothschild dealmaker, tried in vain to dissuade Ghosn and the Renault board from proposing an opt-out at the company's April 30 general meeting. With a 15 percent stake in the carmaker and an only slightly larger share of the vote, the government seemed likely to lose such a face-off.Then, on the evening of April 7, Macron called Ghosn to let him know - as a courtesy - that the state had bought another 4.73 percent of Renault for 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), would announce its maneuver in the morning and planned to sell back down to 15 percent only after defeating his opt-out.""He would always go in with guns blazing,"" a former minister said of Macron. ""Only then would the real power dynamics of the situation register.""With that step, seen by detractors and admirers alike as an unprecedented government ""raid"", the simmering battle of egos between Ghosn the global CEO and Macron the wunderkind banker-turned-minister had burst into the open.Brushing aside warnings, Macron pressed ahead and defeated the opt-out. The vote handed France an effective blocking minority at Renault, which in turn controlled Nissan shareholder meetings via its 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese firm.Alarm bells rang in Tokyo as that sank in, ratcheting tensions higher over the months that followed. Nissan threatened to exit the Restated Alliance Master Agreement (RAMA) - a radical step that would have freed it to buy up shares in its smaller French parent, and end or reverse Renault's control.""The governance of Renault and consequently the autonomy of Renault management, which have been the basis of trust (for) the alliance, will be significantly impacted,"" Saikawa wrote in a Sept. 3, 2015, note to the Renault board obtained by Reuters.A Nissan spokesman declined to comment for this story. Macron's staff initially dismissed Saikawa's demands - that Renault sell down its controlling Nissan stake, restore voting rights to Nissan's 15 percent Renault holding and relinquish control of the alliance - seeing them as dictated by Ghosn, who at that point remained Nissan CEO.""When Ghosn talks about what Nissan and Japan think, he's speaking for himself,"" an official at the French agency that oversees state shareholdings said at the time. ""It's all rubbish as far as I'm concerned.""MACRON MISJUDGEDFast-forward three years: Ghosn is gone, detained for now in a Tokyo cell to face accusations that he misappropriated Nissan assets, misrepresented company investments and - partly as a result - massively under-reported his real compensation. He denies the allegations, according to NHK television.And yet the same Nissan demands are back on the table.""The terminology, the phrases and vocabulary we're hearing today are much the same as in 2015,"" said another former French government official, now an investment banker.""We didn't believe Ghosn when he presented the Japanese position, but in fact it was no invention.""Macron's pressure for a full Renault-Nissan merger also raised hackles in Japan months before the Nissan whistleblower probe that led to Ghosn's arrest and ouster as chairman.Having previously insisted that France would first have to sell its Renault stake, Ghosn agreed this year https://www.reuters.com/article/renault-nissan-alliance/renault-nissan-ready-to-merge-if-france-exits-stake-ceo-idUSL5N1FV1U4 to explore a closer tie-up in return for the renewal of his Renault CEO contract with government backing, and he then revived deal talks.This week, executives from Renault, Nissan and Nissan-controlled Mitsubishi (T:7211) are gathering for the first time since Ghosn's arrest. The Amsterdam meetings are aimed at keeping shared plants and programs ticking over in the sudden absence of a global leader, and averting conflict.But as the appointments dispute threatens to escalate into a new boardroom fight, Renault's hand is critically weakened by another deal Macron struck to end the last stand-off.At the end of 2015, as tension mounted over Nissan's threat to sever alliance ties, France agreed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan/renault-nissans-french-peace-deal-leaves-investors-underwhelmed-idUSKBN0TU17R20151212 to cap its Renault voting rights at 18 percent for most non-strategic decisions.But the Macron-backed ""stabilization"" agreement went further, with a binding pledge by Renault never to oppose the Nissan board at a company shareholder meeting. In the now-unfolding tussle over directorships, that is a handicap.The reversal was a staggering ""failure of oversight"" from a government that had intervened to protect what it saw as Renault's interests, according to Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a Paris shareholder advisory firm.""It's nothing less than the abandonment of Renault's rights over its main asset,"" Dessaint said on Tuesday. ""Renault has effectively forfeited its votes in Nissan.""He added: ""Now we're approaching a situation where they realize too late it's had an impact on their negotiating position. The alliance power balance is already upended.""DISTRACTIONSWhen approached by Reuters, former president Hollande declined to comment on his administration's handling of the voting rights saga of three years ago.But Macron's cabinet colleague said he seemed distracted towards the end of the year when - as is now known - he was preparing to launch En Marche, the political party that eventually carried him to the presidency. The web address en-marche.fr was registered on Jan. 7, 2016, less than four weeks after the Renault-Nissan deal was brokered.""It didn't prevent him from being very engaged with his dossiers, given his intelligence and capacity for work,"" the ex-minister said. ""But they were no longer his main concern.""Ghosn also bears some responsibility for escalating his 2015 battle with the economy minister, he added.""Ghosn had the absolutely insufferable conviction that he was above dealing with ministers, so he'd only ever consider talking to a prime minister - which I doubt endeared him much to Macron, who was also rarely unaware of his own significance.""At least part of that verdict was shared by another cabinet colleague, Christophe Sirugue, when asked about his relationship with Renault's CEO a year after the dispute was settled.""With Carlos Ghosn? You have got to be kidding,"" said Sirugue, then industry minister for Europe's third-ranked economy - and Renault's biggest market. ""As far as he's concerned I don't exist.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

343,"Nov 28, 2018 02:15AM ET",Auditor had questioned Nissan on payments to Ghosn at heart of scandal: source,nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co’s (T:7201) auditor had repeatedly questioned transactions at the heart of allegations of financial misconduct by former chief Carlos Ghosn but Nissan said they were proper, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC questioned Nissan's management several times, chiefly around 2013, about purchases of overseas luxury homes for Ghosn’s personal use and of stock-appreciation rights that were conferred on him.But the Japanese automaker said the transactions and financial reporting were appropriate, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.The revelation shows Nissan and its auditor were discussing the transactions, in apparent contrast with Nissan’s contention that the alleged misreporting of benefits for Ghosn was masterminded by Ghosn and a key lieutenant.A spokesman for EY ShinNihon, the Japanese affiliate of global accounting firm Ernst & Young, said he could not comment on specific cases. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment.Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 as he arrived in Japan. Prosecutors accuse him of falsifying Nissan’s annual reports to understate by about half his total compensation of some 10 billion yen ($90 million) over several years. The high-profile former executive has denied the allegations, according to Japanese media. Ghosn remains in custody and is unable to speak publicly. He is represented by former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, according to Japanese media.Otsuru’s law firm declined to comment on Wednesday, and Otsuru has not responded to requests for comment.Nissan has largely pinned the blame on Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a former representative director who was arrested along with Ghosn on the same allegations.“As a result of the investigation, we are certain these two are the masterminds,” CEO Hiroto Saikawa told a news conference on Nov. 19, referring to Ghosn and Kelly. He declined to say whether others at Nissan were involved in the alleged wrongdoing. An internal investigation is ongoing, and Nissan says it is cooperating with prosecutors.Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) have removed Ghosn as chairman in the wake of his arrest. The French member of the three-firm alliance,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), retains him as chairman and CEO.EY ShinNihon questioned Nissan management about Zi-A Capital BV, asking whether the Dutch unit - which purchased the overseas homes for Ghosn's use - was conducting business in line with its stated aim as an investment company, said the source, who is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The car maker said Zi-A was conducting its business appropriately, the source said. Japanese media have valued the transactions at more than 2 billion yen.Similarly, the source said, the auditor asked whether the stock-appreciation rights – which are like stock options but pay out in cash if a share rises to a certain price – should be declared, but Nissan replied that was not necessary. Japanese media say the rights were worth some 4 billion yen.EY ShinNihon had been auditor for Toshiba Corp (T:6502) and Olympus Corp (T:7733) during financial scandals at the two Japanese companies in recent years. The auditor’s questioning of Nissan on the transactions was first reported by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

344,"Nov 27, 2018 09:58AM ET",Mitsubishi Motors says Nissan-Renault alliance can survive turmoil,nan,"By Maki ShirakiOKAZAKI, Japan (Reuters) - A senior executive at Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) said on Tuesday its alliance with Nissan Motor (T:7201) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) can survive management upheaval, a day after it fired Carlos Ghosn as chairman over financial misconduct allegations.The future of the 19-year alliance, one of the biggest automotive groups in the world, has been thrown into doubt after the Nov. 19 arrest and subsequent ousting of Ghosn as chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.Ghosn, 64, is the architect of the alliance and its chairman. He also remains CEO and chairman of Renault.Senior executives of the alliance are due to meet for their regularly scheduled gathering later this week in Amsterdam that sources said would start on Wednesday. Executives are also expected to discuss Ghosn's chairmanship of the alliance, one source at Nissan told Reuters, seeking anonymity because the contents of the meeting are not public.Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko said on Monday he would join the meeting via video link, while Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who remains in Japan, hasn't decided whether he will travel for the meeting, two company sources said. Nissan declined to comment.A major longer-term focus is whether and how the ownership structure of the alliance might evolve, as Ghosn, under pressure from the French government, had pushed for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger between Renault and Nissan, despite strong reservations at Nissan.Renault holds around 43 percent of Nissan, which in turn owns a controlling 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Nissan, the biggest partner in the alliance by sales, has a non-voting 15 percent stake in the French partner.Speaking to reporters at a research and development center in Okazaki, central Japan, Mitsubishi Executive Vice President Mitsuhiko Yamashita said that regardless of the shape the alliance takes, the three companies would continue to source more parts together and leverage their ties to develop new technologies.""I can't say how the three-way partnership might evolve, but as car-making requires more and more new technologies, the days when a single car maker can handle everything on its own are going to disappear,"" Yamashita, who once served as Nissan's top engineer, said.RENAULT AUDITRenault will appoint a new chief compliance officer to head the carmaker's own independent audit triggered by Nissan's allegations against Ghosn, three sources said on Tuesday, two days after Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the probe.The investigation will conduct checks on Ghosn's pay and benefits as well as those of his immediate staff and executives, they said. The promotion of security chief Eric Le Grand to the new compliance role was first reported by Les Echos.Ghosn is in detention in Tokyo over suspicion of financial misconduct, including alleged understating of his income and personal use of corporate money. He has denied those allegations, public broadcaster NHK has reported.He has not made public comments on the allegations and Reuters could not contact him or his lawyers for comments.Yamashita said the alliance would need to work out who would make decisions, and how, without the binding figure of Ghosn, but was confident the partnership was strong enough to withstand the challenge.""Renault and Nissan have a history of nearly 20 years, and we're coming up on two years since Mitsubishi Motors joined,"" he said. ""The foundation on which the cooperation has been built is becoming strong so I have faith that we can work with that.""Sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy, the Franco-Japanese alliance was enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi and enabled the members to jointly develop products and control costs.Yamashita's remark echoes comments by Saikawa who told staff in a town hall meeting on Monday that the alliance remained important to generate synergies.Saikawa also said there was an ""excessive concentration of power"" on Ghosn, and that in future alliance members should communicate better to help preserve their independence.FRESH ALLEGATIONSIn fresh allegations on Tuesday, Japanese media reported that Ghosn had shifted personal investment losses incurred during the 2008 financial crisis to Nissan to avoid millions of dollars in losses for himself.Citing several unidentified sources, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said that when Ghosn's bank had called for more collateral from the executive, he instead handed the rights over the derivatives trade to Nissan, which effectively shouldered 1.7 billion yen ($15 million) in losses.Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) discovered this incident during that year's routine inspection, the newspaper said.Nissan said it could not comment on the report. An SESC spokesman said the watchdog could not comment on individual cases.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

345,"Nov 26, 2018 05:10AM ET","Mitsubishi Motors ousts Ghosn as chairman, follows Nissan's footsteps",nan,"By Sam Nussey and Chang-Ran KimTOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp said on Monday its board removed Carlos Ghosn from his role as chairman, following his arrest and ouster from alliance partner Nissan Motor Co last week for alleged financial misconduct.Ghosn's ouster marks the end of his chairmanship of Japanese automakers, just two years after he was praised for bringing a steadying hand to Mitsubishi Motors following a cheating scandal in 2016. CEO Osamu Masuko will become temporary chairman, the automaker said. The move comes amid discontent over French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA's role in the 19-year alliance of which Ghosn was the driving force. Sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy, it was enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi and enabled the members to jointly develop products and control costs.The alliance vies with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp for the ranking of the world's biggest automaker. Even as Nissan has recovered and grown rapidly, it remains a junior partner in the shareholding structure. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan and the Japanese automaker holds a 15 percent non-voting stake in the French firm. And Nissan is almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales. Top alliance executives are meeting this week in Amsterdam, aiming to shield their joint operations from the fallout of Ghosn's arrest as a power struggle between Nissan and Renault looms. Renault has refrained from firing him as chairman and CEO.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told staff on Monday that power was too concentrated with Ghosn and that in future better communication between alliance board members and executives would help preserve independence and generate synergies among the automakers, a Nissan spokesman said. Ghosn was pushing for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger between Renault and Nissan at the French government's urging, despite strong reservations at the Japanese firm.Nissan removed Ghosn at a high stakes board meeting on Thursday after allegations of understating his income and using company money for personal use.Ghosn has denied the allegations, public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday. Nissan holds a controlling 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors and has two executives on the board.While the automakers have stressed that operations and business are proceeding as normal, Nissan has postponed the launch of its high-performance Leaf electric car ""to ensure that this important product unveiling could receive the coverage it merits"", a Nissan spokesman said.Shares in Mitsubishi Motors closed up 3.3 percent ahead of the announcement while Nissan climbed 1.8 percent, outperforming the broader market's 0.8 percent gain.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

With both championships already won, Hamilton taking his in Mexico with two races to spare and Mercedes sealing their fifth successive constructors' and drivers' double in Brazil, Sunday's focus was on the race and those moving on -- particularly Alonso.Hamilton, Vettel and the Spaniard -- three great champions -- spun their cars in a cloud of smoke at the end of their slowing down lap, before stepping out for hugs and words of mutual respect.""Fernando is a true legend. It's been a privilege to race when he is racing,"" Hamilton said. ""The sport will miss him and I will miss him from the sport.""Australian Daniel Ricciardo was another saying goodbye, to his Red Bull team before moving to  Renault  (PA:RENA), and he finished fourth after leading for a long stint when Hamilton pitted early.TOUGH YEARHamilton's team mate and 2017 race winner Valtteri Bottas was fifth, after starting on the front row, and ended the season winless and fifth overall.He and Verstappen banged wheels as they fought for position, forcing Bottas to make another pitstop for a suspected slow puncture.""It's been a mentally pretty tough year so I need a break,"" said the Finn.Compatriot Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, retired seven laps into his final race with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) as his car cruised to a halt on the pit straight, triggering a virtual safety car and Hamilton's early stop.The 39-year-old, joining Sauber next season, still ended third overall in the championship, two points ahead of Verstappen.McLaren-bound Carlos Sainz finished sixth in his last race for Renault ahead of Sauber's Charles Leclerc, who now heads to Ferrari, and Force India's Sergio Perez.The Haas pairing of Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen took ninth and 10th.The safety car was deployed at the end of the opening lap when Nico Hulkenberg's Renault was sent barrel-rolling several times before coming to rest upside down on the tyre wall after a collision with Romain Grosjean's Haas.""Get me out of this car.

Ghosn's duties have been delegated to second-in-command Thierry Bollore and board director Philippe Lagayette.RIGHTS DISPUTEBehind the scenes, fundamental differences have opened up over Renault's rights under the alliance's Restated Alliance Master Agreement (RAMA), sources familiar with the matter said.Nissan, the larger partner by sales, has also revived a long-held ambition to force Renault to sell down its controlling stake.On the eve of Ghosn's Nov. 22 ouster from Nissan, Renault informed Saikawa and his board colleagues that it planned to appoint a fourth director under the terms of the 2002 founding pact, Reuters earlier reported.In his formal response, the Nissan CEO insisted Renault had no right to make further appointments. The French company currently has three Nissan board members - including Ghosn, whose directorship can be revoked only by a shareholder meeting.The number of Renault managers on Nissan's executive committee might even be reduced, one company official told Reuters. ""Discussions might include whether to let Renault keep its two positions,"" he said.The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, weighed in on Sunday. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was still waiting for evidence of wrongdoing by Ghosn - adding that a new audit would be carried out at Renault.Efforts underway to secure and deepen the Renault-Nissan alliance must ""respect the crossed shareholdings such as they are today,"" the minister also told BFM TV. Nissan currently holds a reciprocal non-voting 15 percent stake in Renault.INVESTOR PRESSURESaikawa's independence struggle is already drawing support from investors keen to unlock the discounted value of Renault's large holding in its Japanese affiliate.""The relationship between Nissan and Renault needs to be rebalanced,"" Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said on Sunday. ""We urge Renault to sell down its stake in Nissan ... toward 25 percent (and) use the proceeds to buy back its own stock."" At Nissan's Thursday board meeting, Renault appointees also voted to eject Ghosn. They did so after reviewing 400 pages of internal findings, sources said - but are barred from sharing the information even with the French carmaker.The Amsterdam gathering is likely to see Bollore and Saikawa meet face-to-face for the first time since Ghosn's arrest, sources close to the companies said.""These are purely operational sessions,"" a Renault official said.All three carmakers have stressed that operations and alliance business are proceeding as normal. Nissan, however, called off the launch of a high-performance Leaf electric car, cancelling Nov. 28 events in Yokohama and Amsterdam.A Nissan spokesman gave no reason for the postponement and said the company had yet to set a new date for the announcement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

As soon as the cap was removed it was not viable for us.""Palmer said Aston backed Red Bull's Honda partnership, and saw the Japanese manufacturer working hard to improve performance.""Red Bull makes its own decision, I’m certainly supportive of that decision.

I race every week of my life,"" he added.""Sometimes it’s here in this paddock, some other weekends it’s on a go-kart track, some others in sports cars, if not in the video games. I’m a full-time race driver. That’s probably the way I hope people will think about me in the future.""NO REGRETSThey may also look at the titles he won with  Renault  (PA:RENA) in 2005 and 2006 and reflect that he deserved to walk away with more than that.Alonso could have won the 2007 title, missing out by a single point, and the 2008 crown had he stayed with McLaren rather than falling out with the former champions. At Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), the Spaniard led to Abu Dhabi in 2010 only to lose out to Sebastian Vettel, who went on a run of four titles in a row for Red Bull -- a team Alonso might also have joined.Saturday was not a time for regrets, however, as Alonso listened to video tributes from some of the figures of his past -- including former Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo and ex-Renault team boss Flavio Briatore -- in a packed paddock.""It has been a privilege to work with friends I will have for the rest of my life,"" he said, before sitting in a deckchair for the photographers -- an echo of the 2015 Brazilian Grand Prix where he 'sunbathed' on a marshal's chair after retiring his McLaren with yet another Honda engine failure.""It’s a strange day, like the last day of school but I will not be here next year when we come back after the next holidays,"" he added.""I will be always part of this amazing feeling. Half of my life, 18 years I’ve been with the same people every two weeks traveling around the world, working, racing hard but at the same time enjoying ourselves.""Real friendship has been probably the biggest thing of my career and the thing I will remember for the future.""Formula One chairman Chase Carey said Alonso was a special part of the sport's history.""Sports are built on heroes, champions, stars, and Fernando is all of those and more,"" said the American.""You’ve been a hero to people around the world, you have fans around the world.

354,"Nov 23, 2018 04:20AM ET",Interim Renault boss: I'll protect our interests in Nissan alliance,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) interim deputy chief executive said he would safeguard the carmaker's interests in its alliance with Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), following the ouster of Carlos Ghosn as Nissan chairman over financial misconduct allegations.The Nissan board's vote to remove Ghosn as chairman on Thursday drew a firm line under his stewardship of the nearly two-decade-old alliance. ""I will make sure we guarantee our stability and stay focused on our missions to preserve the interests of  Renault  and the sustainability of the alliance,"" Thierry Bollore, named as Ghosn's stand-in at Renault after the industrial star's arrest in Japan, said in a video to shareholders. The shareholding structure among Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, which was brought into the alliance in 2016, has become a source of tension alongside the removal of Ghosn, with Nissan unhappy with what it sees as a junior partner status.Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan has only a 15-percent non-voting share in Renault. Yet Nissan is 60 percent bigger than the French automaker by sales. The relationship is further complicated by the role of the French state, which holds 15 percent of Renault and enjoys double-voting rights. Ghosn and former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly are being investigated over alleged conspiracy to understate Ghosn's compensation over five years from fiscal 2010 by about half of the actual 9.998 billion yen ($88.9 million).On Friday, the Asahi newspaper reported that Japanese prosecutors are likely to build a new criminal case against Ghosn for understating his remuneration by 3 billion yen ($27.0 million) over three years from fiscal 2015.In the wake of Ghosn's spectacular downfall, French and Japanese government ministers have reaffirmed support for the Renault-Nissan alliance, which was enlarged to include Mitsubishi in 2016.

355,"Nov 22, 2018 12:02PM ET",Nissan ends Ghosn's two-decade reign with last-minute Renault backing,nan,"By Sam Nussey, Maki Shiraki and Laurence FrostYOKOHAMA, Japan/PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan's (T:7201) board voted unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn over allegations of financial misconduct, after French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) backed away from a last-minute demand to postpone the decision on their alliance leader's fate.The vote - supported by Renault appointees on the Nissan board after a four-hour meeting - may begin to defuse a crisis that threatened to upend the alliance and spark a diplomatic rift between Japan and France, Renault's main shareholder.It also drew a firm line under Ghosn's stewardship of the car empire that was his life's work. Ghosn was arrested in Japan on Monday after a Nissan investigation uncovered evidence of serious wrongdoing including under-reporting of his remuneration and personal use of company assets.""The board acknowledged the significance of the matter and confirmed that the longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,"" the Japanese carmaker said.Nissan said its board dismissed Ghosn and fellow representative director Greg Kelly, an alleged co-conspirator, ""after reviewing a detailed report of the internal investigation"" - the first time Renault had seen key findings.With Ghosn and Kelly still in custody, neither man has been able to defend himself publicly against the allegations.ULTIMATUMBefore the meeting, two Renault board directors had demanded a postponement of the vote to fire Ghosn until the internal probe and legal proceedings were complete, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Failing that, they had warned that the French carmaker would exercise its right under the alliance master agreement to appoint Ghosn's successor and a fourth Renault nominee to the Nissan board, the sources said.The ultimatum was issued in a strongly worded response to Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa - who had informed Renault in an earlier confidential missive that the Nissan investigation was expanding to include Renault-Nissan finances.Nissan is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent.Ghosn had been exploring a deeper Renault-Nissan tie-up that was resisted by the Japanese firm - a fact which has fueled speculation about ulterior motives for his arrest.NO CONSPIRACY?After the board presentation and its summary of findings, however, the tune in Paris had changed.""The accusations are extreme, certainly, but they are also precise,"" said an official at French President Emmanuel Macron's Elysee Palace office.""We know there's a flourishing conspiracy theory about all this, but that's really not our thinking.""After heavy losses earlier in the week, Renault shares were up 0.5 percent at 1615 GMT. Nissan shares closed up 0.8 percent. The Japanese company did not announce a replacement for Ghosn - confounding reports that Saikawa was to be appointed interim chairman. Japanese prosecutors say Ghosn and Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's remuneration by about half the 10 billion yen ($88 million) he earned at Nissan over five years from 2010.Following an internal probe resulting from a whistleblower alert, Ghosn is also accused of misappropriating Nissan assets and ""misrepresenting the purpose"" of company investments.A Nissan executive with direct knowledge of the board meeting said Renault's representatives had initially voiced incomprehension over the accusations.""There was some talk and frustration about an unjust arrest,"" he said. ""But they suddenly changed when they heard the contents - and understood that this wasn't some strange conspiracy.""GHOSNLEAKSJapanese newspapers have been awash with leaked details of the Tokyo prosecutor's investigation into Ghosn. Asahi Shimbun reported on Thursday he had emailed Kelly orders to make false statements about his remuneration.The Yomiuri, Japan's biggest-circulation daily, said Nissan had been paying Ghosn's elder sister $100,000 a year since 2002 for a non-existent advisory role. She lived in a luxury Rio de Janeiro apartment funded by a Nissan subsidiary, according the report, which cited unidentified sources.Mitsubishi Motors, which joined the alliance in 2016, also plans to oust Ghosn as chairman next week. Renault's board named interim replacements on Tuesday but kept Ghosn on as chairman and CEO, with government backing.That stance may now change.Even were he cleared, French officials now concede, Ghosn would be an unlikely figure to rebuild the cross-cultural trust of which he once appeared to be the sole guarantor.""It really seemed there was a common vision between Ghosn and Nissan,"" the Elysee official said. ""But now we realize there was in fact a yawning gap.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

356,"Nov 22, 2018 11:25AM ET","Nissan's Saikawa, a hard-nosed leader, takes center stage after Ghosn's ouster",nan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Maki ShirakiTOKYO (Reuters) - In sacking his long-time mentor Carlos Ghosn as chairman of Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), CEO Hiroto Saikawa has only bolstered his reputation for being a tough leader unafraid to antagonize people in the interests of business.Thursday's board decision to oust Ghosn, one of the most celebrated leaders in the auto industry, comes after he was arrested in Japan this week, accused by Nissan of serious financial misconduct over many years.Saikawa is described by company insiders as smart, exacting and results-oriented. He will have to marshal those qualities as he tackles reputational loss, legal and regulatory issues, as well as suspicions that the arrest was a coup engineered by board members unhappy with Ghosn and the alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).""He's very strong and aggressive,"" said a Nissan executive, adding Saikawa was not afraid to embarrass people in meetings if their performance fell below his standards.""There are people who love him and people who hate him - people who don't like him because he is very strict,"" said the executive who, like other company insiders Reuters spoke to, declined to be identified due to the personal nature of their comments.Nissan has accused Ghosn of using money for personal purposes and under-reporting income. According to Tokyo prosecutors, Ghosn is suspected of reporting only half of some $88 million in earnings over a five-year period.Reuters was unable to reach Ghosn, who has been detained by Tokyo prosecutors, or a lawyer for him.Saikawa only became CEO last year, having been groomed by Ghosn for the job over many years.Another Nissan executive described Saikawa as unflinchingly scrupulous, adding this would have certainly played into how he dealt with the allegations concerning Ghosn once they surfaced within the company.""He's very much 'by the book'. He has one phone for personal use and one for company use and when he rings his family, he never uses the company phone,"" he said.The executive noted that last year's scandal at the Japanese automaker over improper inspection procedures in the domestic market would have made Saikawa even more cautious.""Saikawa's been dealing with the inspection problem since last year and where matters of compliance are concerned, he'd be of the belief that you just can't turn a blind eye.""Nissan declined to comment on the executives' assessment of Saikawa. Saikawa could not be reached for comment.NOW A GHOSN CRITICAt a news conference on Monday to explain the arrest, Saikawa, usually a very fast talker, earned praised on social media for the unhurried and dispassionate way in which he answered questions for close to 90 minutes, unflanked by lawyers or other company officials.""It was also quite telling how he did not stand and bow in apology,"" said a former Nissan executive, adding it was as if Saikawa was signifying that he personally was not at fault.Saikawa on Monday was also frank in his assessment of Ghosn's shortcomings, saying too much power had been concentrated at the top of the company. In addition to the alleged financial misconduct, there were times where Ghosn made decisions without seeking the input he should have, he added.Saikawa was, however, not his usual composed self at a meeting with department chiefs on Tuesday, according to two people who attended. One said he looked like he ""had tears in his eyes"" and another said his voice quivered at one point.Like everybody else at Nissan and Renault, Saikawa's career has long been overshadowed by Ghosn, the charismatic ""Cost Killer"" credited with turning around a debt-ridden automaker by closing 5 plants and cutting 21,000 jobs - drastic steps that broke new ground in Japan and were widely seen at the time as something only an outsider could do.But now it is Saikawa's turn in uncharted waters.Ghosn had been seen by many analysts as the only person who could make the three-way alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) work.""It's going to be extremely difficult for Saikawa,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama, noting it was not clear if Renault, Nissan's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 percent stake, would be supportive.While Saikawa has served on Renault's board for 10 years, he does not have Ghosn's experience in dealing with the French government or the length of experience Ghosn gained in leading Renault and before that as a senior executive at  Michelin  (PA:MICP).""But he's a tough negotiator. Ghosn wouldn't have picked him as CEO if he wasn't,"" Miyao said.Saikawa, who at 65 is a few months older than Ghosn, joined Nissan from the prestigious Tokyo University more than 40 years ago. Described by some as reluctant to stand out, little is known about his private life, beyond that he is married.He has spent much of his career managing purchasing and supply chains, and helped Ghosn break up Nissan's supplier network to reduce costs. Acting as chief competitive officer from 2013 to 2016, he was tasked with reducing manufacturing costs by saving money in raw material procurement, regulatory expenses and planning and development. Saikawa was also instrumental in hammering out the details of Nissan's deal to bring Mitsubishi Motors into the alliance.""He's very much a numbers man - he's hard on those that don't deliver results, although he's also hard on himself,"" said the former Nissan executive. ""Some might say that he lacks warmth.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I wouldn’t rule that out. We’re very happy with our driver lineup for the future -- that’s what we are very focused on at this moment -- but never say never. ""He’s certainly driving at the top of his game.""Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion who left McLaren at the end of 2016, made a one-off return at the following year's Monaco Grand Prix when Alonso was absent racing in the Indianapolis 500.Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne also made his debut in 2016 when Alonso was injured in Australia and ruled out of race two in Bahrain. McLaren have an all-new lineup for 2019, with Spaniard Carlos Sainz joining from  Renault  (PA:RENA) and British teenager Lando Norris stepping up from a reserve role.Two-times Monaco winner Alonso will continue in the World Endurance Championship with Toyota, having won the Le Mans 24 Hours this year, and with McLaren again at the Indy 500 as he chases the ""Triple Crown of Motorsport"".Brown said Alonso was sure to attend some Formula One races next year and did not rule out a new role for him eventually.""He talks about one of these days having a management shirt,"" said the American. ""He loves being at racetracks: when he’s not at a Formula One track or endurance, you’ll find him at his go-kart track. He can’t stay away from racetracks.""He’s still a McLaren driver. We're doing the Indianapolis 500 together, so I think Fernando has other ways he can influence and help our team.""'IMMENSE TALENT'Brown hailed the Spaniard as one of the greatest of his era and one who could have won many more championships than his two with Renault.Sunday's race at Yas Marina, he said, would be emotional, if also something of a disappointment.""It’s a shame that he won’t go out with a chance of victory or podiums -- that’s probably disappointing for all of us because he’s driving the best he’s ever driven,"" said the American. ""This weekend I’m sure it’ll be tough even to get into the points.""Former champions McLaren are sixth in the constructors' standings with 62 points, 50 of them scored by Alonso, who last won a grand prix with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in 2013 and has not had a podium finish since 2014.""Unfortunately, given his long career, he’s only won two championships. Had he been in the right cars over that 17-year career he could be in the same place as Lewis (Hamilton) and Michael (Schumacher) with five, six, seven,"" said Brown.Alonso would surely have won a third title in 2007 had McLaren favored him over rookie team mate Hamilton, with whom he ended the season tied on points while Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen scored one more.Hamilton then took the 2008 title, while Alonso returned to Renault before joining Ferrari in 2010 -- a year in which he led the championship into the final race at Abu Dhabi before strategy wrecked his hopes.The return to McLaren, unthinkable after the bitterness of 2007, came in 2015 but also coincided with the team's worst run of form and an ultimately doomed partnership with Honda that ended last year.TALENT BELIES STATISTICSFerrari have also not won a drivers' title since Raikkonen's.""His statistics probably fall short of his immense talent,"" said Brown, rejecting talk of the Spaniard being a disruptive influence and highlighting his intensity and hard work behind the scenes.""I’m well aware of the stories over the years but from my perspective he’s been a fast race-car driver who wants the best equipment and the best out of people, and doesn’t accept anything short of perfection.""He’s been a pleasure to work with.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

358,"Nov 21, 2018 05:53AM ET",Nissan wants less clout from Renault as Japan seeks to stabilize alliance,nan,"By Daniel Leussink and Sam NusseyTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said it is ready to work for the stability of the Nissan-Renault global alliance following the stunning arrest of common Chairman Carlos Ghosn, but a Nissan executive said the Japanese automaker is seeking ways to weaken the influence of its French partner.The 19-year alliance, enlarged in 2016 to include Japan's Mitsubishi Motors, has been jolted by Monday's arrest of Ghosn for alleged financial misconduct. Ghosn has personally shaped the alliance and had pledged to consolidate it with a deeper tie-up. ""We need to return to the original idea of a win-win relationship,"" a long-time Nissan executive told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. It should be ""a more equal relationship than before."" A reduction of Renault's stake in Nissan - which recovered from near-bankruptcy after Ghosn took its helm and has become more profitable than its French partner - should be one option under consideration, the Nissan executive said.The French automaker currently owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, which in turn holds a non-voting 15 percent stake in  Renault  (PA:RENA) and 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors. One of the world's best-known auto industry executives, Ghosn bestrode the alliance, serving also as chief executive of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, although his efforts to drive integration were hampered by the French government's 15 percent stake in Renault.On Monday Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa portrayed Nissan as a victim of Ghosn's alleged misdeeds. But Nissan itself faces scrutiny over the financial misconduct case, with the Asahi newspaper reporting on Wednesday prosecutors are weighing bringing a case against the Japanese automaker.With Ghosn potentially gone from the picture, the future shape of the alliance is the subject of intense investor speculation. Mitsubishi Motors CEO Osamu Masuko said on Tuesday it may be hard to manage without the unifying figure of Ghosn.The success of the alliance, which helps the automakers develop products and control costs, is critical for the members at a time when the industry is buffeted by major changes in consumer tastes and rivals are investing billions in new growth areas like automated and internet-connected vehicles.Given those considerations, the Japanese and French governments have backed the alliance and called for its stability in the aftermath of Ghosn's arrest.Japan said on Wednesday it was ready to support the alliance. It ""is a symbol of Franco-Japanese industrial success,"" the top government spokesman said, calling for a ""stable relationship"" between the three automakers.WHISTLEBLOWERNissan said on Monday an internal investigation triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting for years how much he was earning. It plans to remove him from the post on Thursday.Ghosn, 64, was arrested by Japanese prosecutors who said he and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's compensation at Nissan over five years starting in fiscal 2010 as being about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88.65 million).Ghosn and Kelly, who has also been arrested, have not commented on the accusations so far and Reuters has not been able to reach them.Kyodo News reported on Wednesday that the Tokyo District Court has decided that Ghosn and Kelly will be detained for 10 days.Japan's Nikkei business daily reported on Tuesday that Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen over a five-year period to March 2015 but that it went unreported in Nissan's financial statements. Prosecutors also plan to interview Saikawa on a voluntary basis, NHK reported on Wednesday citing unnamed sources. Prosecutors were not immediately able to comment. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment.Renault on Tuesday tapped its chief operating officer and a senior board member to fill in for Ghosn, but the board refrained from firing him while waiting for details on the allegations - a decision that could buy more time for an accelerated, permanent succession process.Shares in Nissan closed up 0.4 percent on Wednesday after falling nearly 6 percent a day earlier.

359,"Nov 21, 2018 02:41AM ET",Renault Names Bollore Interim CEO as Nissan Tension Deepens,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Tensions between Nissan Motor Co. and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) over the future of their car-making partnership have exploded into the open as the downfall of Chairman Carlos Ghosn roils the automotive industry and top lieutenant, Hiroto Saikawa, moves to consolidate power in his absence.The two companies, which are connected via a complex structure of cross-shareholdings and joint manufacturing, have drastically differed in their reactions to Ghosn’s arrest in Japan on suspicion of financial offenses.Tuesday night in Paris, Renault’s board stopped short of firing the French-Brazilian executive, and asked Nissan to hand over details of his alleged misdeeds. Nissan, by contrast, said after he was detained on Monday that it intends to dismiss Ghosn, 64, as chairman -- acting with a haste that’s fueled open speculation that he was the victim of a coup by Saikawa, who serves as Nissan’s chief executive officer, and others opposed to deeper integration between the two companies.Nissan’s board will meet on Thursday to make a formal decision on Ghosn’s future.For its part, Renault’s board indicated that it was in the dark about the details of the allegations against Ghosn. “At this stage, the board is unable to comment on the evidence seemingly gathered against Mr. Ghosn by Nissan and the Japanese judicial authorities,” it said in a statement.No BailGhosn, who was among the best-paid executives in both France and Japan, stands accused of under-reporting income of about $44 million and misusing company funds at Nissan. According to NHK, Nissan paid ""huge sums"" toward Ghosn’s residences in four global cities, payments that the broadcaster said lacked a business justification, and also covered the cost of vacations for his family. Ghosn hasn’t commented on any of the allegations, or been seen in public since his arrest.“Japan will not tolerate executive greed. And enriching for your own personal wealth -- and this superstar mentality where the CEO gets paid 20, 25 times what the average worker gets paid -- Japan does not want to tolerate,"" Jesper Koll, the CEO of fund manager WisdomTree Investments, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There’s no question Carlos Ghosn is being used as a symbol to ensure that corporate leadership in Japan will stay close to its workers.”Japan’s legal system is opaque even to locals, and basic details of Ghosn’s location and immediate future are unknown, although he’s likely at a detention facility in northern Tokyo. Bail cannot be granted until prosecutors decide whether to proceed with an indictment, a process that could take weeks, and Ghosn won’t necessarily be joined by an attorney when he’s questioned during that time. Prosecutors on Wednesday received court approval to hold Ghosn for another 10 days, the Kyodo newswire reported.Partnership TensionsMore than Ghosn’s personal future is at stake.The charismatic executive led both Nissan and Renault as well as their wider alliance, which unites the iconic French and Japanese companies with the smaller Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He had worked toward a merger of Nissan and Renault to solidify their two-decade-old relationship, a union that would create a direct rival to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp. for the title of the world’s largest automaker.But Saikawa publicly played down that prospect earlier this year, prompting a private rebuke from Ghosn, his one-time mentor, who warned his Japanese colleague that his comments risked undermining Nissan’s credibility, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.Saikawa has so far been the face of Nissan’s reaction to Ghosn’s arrest, appearing alone at a press conference late Monday where he announced Nissan’s plan to fire him. He had harsh words for the detained boss. “This is an act that cannot be tolerated by our company,” Saikawa said, arguing that an excessive concentration of power in Ghosn’s hands created an environment ripe for misconduct.Nissan VoteSaikawa’s influence at Nissan will grow in Ghosn’s absence. Nissan’s board on Thursday probably won’t name immediate replacements for Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an American director also accused of wrongdoing, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would reduce the board to seven members, including Saikawa, and take the number of non-Japanese directors from four to two.For now, Renault has named Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore as interim CEO, with the same powers as Ghosn. In a letter to Renault employees, he pledged “full support” for Ghosn and to protect the Nissan partnership.The full scope of potential allegations against Ghosn and others is unclear. Nissan has told Renault board members that the company is looking into potential wrongdoing at the alliance’s Amsterdam-based joint venture, RNBV, according to three people familiar with the matter.So far the French government, which is Renault’s largest shareholder, is reserving judgment on Ghosn. On Tuesday, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire told France Info radio that “we will not demand he be removed” from the company because “we have no proof.” France has examined Ghosn’s local tax records and found “nothing particular,” Le Maire added.While both Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshige Seko, reaffirmed their support for the alliance, the structure of the partnership between the two companies has been increasingly controversial in Japan as Nissan outgrows Renault in sales and profits. Renault owns a 43 percent voting stake in Nissan, which owns just 15 percent of Renault -- without voting rights."
360,"Nov 20, 2018 08:50PM ET",Renault names Ghosn stand-ins amid tension over Nissan probe,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Chang-Ran KimPARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) tapped its chief operating officer and a senior board member to fill in for embattled boss Carlos Ghosn, after an investigation by alliance partner Nissan led to his arrest on suspicion of financial misconduct.Thierry Bollore, Ghosn's operational second-in-command, will become deputy chief executive, while lead independent director Philippe Lagayette assumes the function of interim chairman, Renault said after a board meeting late on Tuesday.But the board refrained from firing Ghosn while awaiting more detail on the allegations - in a decision that could also buy more time for an accelerated, permanent succession process.""Mr. Ghosn, temporarily incapacitated, remains Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"" Renault said in a statement. ""During this period, the board will meet on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the lead independent director."" Ghosn, one of the car industry's best-known leaders, was arrested on Monday after Nissan said he had engaged in years of wrongdoing, including personal use of company money and under-reported earnings. The Japanese company plans to remove him as chairman on Thursday.The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, had begun to distance itself from Ghosn, calling for new interim leadership before the meeting, as the Japanese investigation expanded to include Renault-Nissan alliance finances.""Carlos Ghosn is no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier in the day. ""Renault has been weakened, which makes it all the more necessary to act quickly.""Statements by Le Maire, Renault and its board all echoed French preoccupations over the future of the alliance first articulated by President Emmanuel Macron within hours of Ghosn's arrest on Monday.Following talks between Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart Hiroshige Seko on Tuesday, the ministers reaffirmed their ""shared wish to maintain this winning cooperation"".But in a sign that Nissan may now seek to loosen its French parent's hold on the partnership, the Japanese company informed Renault it also had evidence of potential wrongdoing at Renault-Nissan BV, the Dutch venture overseeing alliance operations under Renault's ultimate control, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The private communication came from Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, whose company is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault in a complex alliance forged by Ghosn over almost two decades.MAJOR PLAYERClose to bankruptcy when Renault bought its stake in 1999, Nissan has recovered to be the engine of an alliance that generates synergies for both companies and allows them to rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp on the global stage. But there have long been tensions as Nissan, while almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault.In its board statement, Renault invoked ""principles of transparency, trust and mutual respect set forth in the alliance charter"" to demand that Nissan provide ""all information in (its) possession arising from the internal investigation.""Renault shares closed 1.2 percent lower before the meeting, extending Monday's decline of more than 8 percent. Nissan fell another 5.5 percent, while Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the third alliance member, ended down nearly 7 percent.Mitsubishi Motors' CEO Osamu Masuko said it could be hard to manage the alliance without the unifying figure of Ghosn.""I don't think there is anyone else on Earth like Ghosn who could run Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi,"" he told reporters in Tokyo.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) cut its rating on Renault to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", while Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) moved to ""neutral"" from ""outperform"".DIFFICULT TIMEThe end of Ghosn's leadership poses questions and risks for an alliance he had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership. It comes at a difficult time for the industry, already grappling with tighter emissions regulations, a diesel sales collapse and big investments in electric and self-driving cars. Ghosn's alleged improprieties also raise questions over governance at the alliance, over which he presided relatively unchecked as chairman of all three partners' boards. Japan's Nikkei business daily, citing unidentified sources, said Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen ($36 million) over a five-year period to March 2015, but it went unreported in Nissan's financial reports. The financial reports also did not mention annual compensation of 100 million to 150 million yen Ghosn received from the automaker's overseas subsidiaries, the newspaper said. Nissan declined to comment on the report. Japanese public broadcaster NHK also said Nissan had paid billions of yen to buy and renovate homes for Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources. The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in compensation filings to the Tokyo bourse, NHK said. There has been no comment from Ghosn on the allegations, and Reuters could not contact him for comment.A French diplomatic source said the country’s ambassador in Tokyo had seen Ghosn on Tuesday as part of usual procedures for a French citizen being held in Japan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

361,"Nov 20, 2018 07:20PM ET",These Are the Key Players in Carlos Ghosn's Downfall,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. has made shocking allegations against its longtime leader Carlos Ghosn, accusing him of understating his compensation in securities filings and using company assets for personal use.The alleged misconduct has thrown an almost 20-year-old alliance between Nissan and France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) into chaos.Here’s a look at the cast of characters involved:Carlos GhosnRole: Chairman of Nissan, Renault, Mitsubishi Motors and their three-way alliance; chief executive officer of RenaultWhy he matters: The 64-year-old has been the glue binding together three automakers that were highly troubled before he took command starting in the 1990s. Ghosn relinquished the Nissan CEO role last year and had been trying to structure the alliance so that it was “irreversible,” potentially through an outright merger.What he has said: Attempts to reach Ghosn and his representatives for comment since the news of his arrest emerged Monday have been unsuccessful. In an interview last year, he said he might remain a boardroom fixture as long as Ferdinand Piech, who was chairman of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG into his late 70s. “I am not just shutting the door and going fishing or something,” Ghosn said.Greg KellyRole: Senior vice president of talent management for the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance and a Nissan directorWhy he matters: Kelly became the first American to serve on Nissan’s board in 2012, having risen through the ranks of the company’s human-resources operations. CEO Hiroto Saikawa on Monday described Kelly and Ghosn as the “masterminds” behind years of alleged misconduct.What he has said: As with Ghosn, nobody has seen or heard from Kelly or those representing him since his arrest. Unlike his oft-quoted and highly visible boss, he’s flown under the radar during the course of his 30-year career.Hiroto SaikawaRole: CEO of NissanWhy he matters: A lifer who joined Nissan a month after graduating from Tokyo University in 1977, Saikawa became a Ghosn protege and served in key roles spanning the globe, including purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing and research and development. He publicly bristled at reports that Ghosn was pursuing a potential Renault-Nissan merger, saying there was no merit to combining the companies and emphasizing the need to preserve autonomy.What he has said: During a press conference late Monday in Yokohama, Saikawa credited Ghosn with implementing reforms Nissan couldn’t have achieved on its own. But that was about the extent of the positive things he had to say about his longtime boss. “Beyond being sorry, I feel great disappointment, frustration, despair, indignation and resentment,” Saikawa said. “This is the negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn.”Thierry BolloreRole: Chief operating officer and temporary deputy CEO of RenaultWhy he matters: Ghosn hinted to French lawmakers in January that he would eventually hand off the day-to-day responsibility of running Renault, spurring months of speculation about his successor. He ended up agreeing to stay on as both chairman and CEO for another four years, but the company elevated Bollore to second-in-command. The 55-year-old French national started his career at tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and joined Renault in 2012.What he has said: In a letter to employees sent late Monday, Bollore expressed “full support” for Ghosn, while pledging to protect the partnership with the Japanese automakers.Philippe LagayetteRole: Lead independent director of Renault; chaired the board’s meeting late TuesdayWhy he matters: The 75-year-old chairman of French consultant and advisory firm PL Conseils has been on Renault’s board since 2007. He leads the audit, risk and ethics committee and is a member of the compensation committee. Renault appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach to dealing with Ghosn thus far, but these are the committees’ whose patience will be tested -- especially if French politicians are less forgiving.What he has said: While Lagayette himself hasn’t spoken up, Renault’s board issued a statement saying it’s unable to comment on the evidence gathered against Ghosn by Nissan and Japanese authorities. The board also asked Nissan to share all the information it’s come up with in its investigation.Hiroshige SekoRole: Japan’s minister of economy, trade and industryWhy he matters: Seko already had a lot on his plate, including automotive trade frictions with U.S. President Donald Trump. The last thing he needed was a potentially catastrophic rupture involving one of Japan’s leading manufacturers.What he has said: Seko said Monday that Ghosn’s situation is regrettable and emphasized the importance of the alliance remaining stable. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also threw his support behind the alliance in a meeting with Hitoshi Kawaguchi, Nissan’s executive in charge of government affairs.Bruno Le MaireRole: France’s Finance MinisterWhy he matters: The French state has balked at Ghosn’s compensation packages in recent years, and he bowed to the pushback in February, accepting a 30 percent cut when his tenure was extended. But Le Maire has been hands-off in the wake of Ghosn’s arrest, saying the government wouldn’t demand his dismissal without evidence. He said the alliance has been weakened and France’s priority is to act quickly to preserve it.What he has said: In a joint statement Tuesday, Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart Seko expressed their “shared wish to maintain this winning cooperation,” calling the alliance “one of the greatest symbols of Franco-Japanese industrial cooperation.”"

Chairman Carlos Ghosn reverberated for a second day as politicians and executives scrambled to fill the vacuum at the top of the world’s largest car alliance amid new reports about his alleged financial improprieties.Renault’s board is convening for a crisis meeting tonight in Paris to discuss the future of its alliance with Nissan and to appoint interim leadership at the French automaker. Earlier, Nissan informed  Renault  (PA:RENA) that it was investigating potential financial wrongdoing at the Dutch-domiciled Renault-Nissan venture, people familiar with the matter said.Back in Japan, where Ghosn has remained in custody since his arrest Monday, more details of his alleged transgressions began trickling out in local media. Combined, they painted a picture of an executive who dipped into company funds to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, from luxury residences dotted around the globe to money funneled into investment funds and family vacations. Ghosn hasn’t been seen in public and hasn’t responded to the allegations.Alliance FutureThe revelations, which followed a months-long internal probe, put key stakeholders in a bind because there’s no obvious successor. While all sides rushed to assure that the alliance was solid, Ghosn was the linchpin holding the partnership together. The French government, which owns 15 percent of Renault, signaled it will protect the automaker, which has benefited hugely from its participation in the French-Japanese pact.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he will meet with management of Renault and state representatives on the board of the company to put in place interim governance. While the French government isn’t demanding Ghosn’s formal dismissal, he is no longer in a position to run the automaker, Le Maire told French radio.Yesterday, President Emmanuel Macron had already said he would remain “extremely vigilant” regarding the stability of the Renault-Nissan alliance. One immediate step will be to fill the post of Renault CEO, which might fall to Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore, whom Ghosn himself had previously called a “good candidate” to eventually replace him at the French carmaker.Bollore will be proposed at the meeting tonight as Renault’s interim leader, together with Philippe Lagayette, an independent board member, as non-executive chairman, according to people familiar with the plan, who asked not be identified ahead of the meeting.Le Maire said the government will seek evidence from Japanese authorities, after the French side was all but blindsided by the probe and subsequent arrest Monday. The board of Renault and the Macron government were both caught unaware by the allegations, according to people familiar with the matter. A Renault spokeswoman declined to comment on the minister’s plans.Broader ProbeThe alleged wrongdoing may have have been more widespread. According to Nikkei, Ghosn may have received unreported funds from the Dutch Renault-Nissan venture amounting to about 100 million yen ($880,000).In a memo to employees sent on Monday, Bollore expressed “full support for our chairman and CEO,” calling the alliance an “industrial gem that must be protected and nurtured.” Renault confirmed the content of the letter, which was cited in full by the Financial Times.While there’s little doubt that Ghosn’s ride atop the global car industry has come to a rapid halt, there’s less clarity on the nature of his transgressions. Japanese broadcaster NHK said Tuesday that Nissan paid “huge sums” toward Ghosn’s residences sprinkled across the globe. The real estate in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, had “no legitimate business reason” and Ghosn wasn’t paying at least some of the rent, the report said.At a late-night press conference in Tokyo Monday, Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa declined to give details on the charges, only saying that had both understated his income and misused company funds, including expenses and investment funds.Real Estate, InvestmentsAll told, Ghosn failed to declare some 5 billion yen in his income on Nissan’s official securities reports submitted over five years starting from 2011, prosecutors in Tokyo said Monday. According to Japanese law, Ghosn can be held in custody for up to 23 days without being charged.The sudden downfall of the larger-than-life executive has spooked investors. Nissan dropped as much as 6.5 percent in Tokyo Tuesday, while Renault continued its slide, falling as much as 4.8 percent in Paris. On Monday, the French stock fell to the lowest since January 2015.Rating ReviewsNissan’s credit rating is also at risk as a result. Standard & Poor’s put its long-term A rating on watch for a possible downgrade, saying profitability might weaken substantially in coming years if the alleged misconduct damages the brand image enough to seriously depress unit sales or hurt the alliance. Moody’s Investor Service separately called the probe “credit negative” for Nissan, though Renault’s outlook is unaffected, it said.Over the course of almost two decades, Nissan has grown into the larger of the two main partners by deliveries and sales -- but it has less say. Renault owns just over 43 percent of Nissan, compared with the Japanese company’s 15 percent stake in the French partner. It also boasts full voting rights in the alliance, while Nissan has none. That lopsided structure was always a point of contention between the French and the Japanese side, and Ghosn was in no small part responsible for preserving the peace between both sides.“The issue is who’s going to control the alliance, and Saikawa has clearly put his cards on the table,” said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings, an investment, private equity and commodity group."
363,"Nov 20, 2018 10:22AM ET",Exclusive: Nissan expands Ghosn probe to include Renault alliance - sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Nissan's investigation into alleged misconduct by Chairman Carlos Ghosn is expanding to include Renault-Nissan finances, sources told Reuters - in a further sign that Nissan may seek to loosen its French parent's hold on their global carmaking alliance.Nissan told Renault's board on Monday it had evidence of potential wrongdoing at Renault-Nissan BV, the Dutch venture overseeing alliance operations under Renault's ultimate control, three people with knowledge of the matter said.The private communication from Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa came as the Japanese carmaker, 43.4 percent-owned by  Renault  (PA:RENA), announced that an investigation had uncovered misconduct involving Ghosn including under-reporting of his compensation and personal use of company assets.Renault and Nissan both declined to comment.Saikawa, once Ghosn's protégé, also disclosed plans to strip Ghosn of his chairmanship, after the 64-year-old industry veteran was arrested in Tokyo along with fellow director Greg Kelly.Neither of the detained men has had the opportunity to comment publicly on the allegations against them.The 19-year history of the Renault-Nissan alliance, enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors, has been marked by tensions among the carmakers and the French government, Renault's main shareholder with a 15 percent stake.Under government pressure, Ghosn, who is also Renault chairman and CEO, had agreed this year to explore a closer tie-up that would tap deeper synergies, safeguard French industrial interests and make the alliance ""irreversible"". The plan raised hackles in Tokyo. Nissan, while almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault.At a news conference in Japan late on Monday, Saikawa outlined three broad categories of accusation against Ghosn: under-reporting of compensation; misrepresenting company investments; and making personal use of company assets. He gave no examples, citing the secrecy of a police investigation.The Nissan CEO nevertheless took aim at a Renault-led alliance setup that ""concentrates power in one individual"", and said a new board committee would examine its role in the scandal.""In terms of structural issues, 43 percent is held by Renault and the head of Renault is currently serving as (chairman) of Nissan,"" Saikawa said.""Of course this isn't the only cause, but it's one of the factors or drivers. So the committee ... will have a deep dive on this issue as well.""French officials have mobilized to defend the alliance since Ghosn's surprise arrest in Japan - which came as both countries stage events to mark 160 years of diplomatic relations.President Emmanuel Macron said France would ""remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance"", the world's largest automotive grouping by sales.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said the future of the industrial pairing was top priority, also pressed Renault's board to appoint interim leadership, saying Ghosn was ""no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault"".The board, meeting later on Tuesday, will likely agree that director Philippe Lagayette should fill in as chairman, several people with knowledge of the deliberations said. It may also bolster Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore's powers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

364,"Nov 20, 2018 07:47AM ET","Explainer: What misconduct is Nissan's Ghosn accused of, and how did it come to light?",nan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan was shocked by news that Nissan Motor Co Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was widely respected for rescuing the car maker from near bankruptcy, was arrested on Monday for alleged financial misconduct.Nissan said that Ghosn, who is also chairman and CEO of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, would be fired from his post as Nissan chairman on Thursday.WHAT IS GHOSN ACCUSED OF?Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told a packed press conference on Monday night that the company had found that Ghosn had been using corporate money for personal purposes and under-reporting his income for years in official company filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Another board member, Greg Kelly, was also deeply involved in the misconduct, Nissan said. Saikawa said he couldn't elaborate as the cases are being investigated by prosecutors, who have declined to comment.Prosecutors said that Ghosn and Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 as being about half of the actual 9.998 billion yen ($88.9 million).Public broadcaster NHK said Nissan paid billions of yen to buy and renovate homes for Ghosn in Rio, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources. The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in TSE filings, NHK said.Ghosn, 64, has not been formally charged. The Asahi newspaper reported that he and Kelly had submitted to prosecutors' questions after getting off a plane on Monday afternoon at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. Saikawa confirmed they had been arrested.Ghosn and Kelly have not been seen since and their exact whereabouts are not known. Suspects are typically taken to the Tokyo Detention Center, which is linked to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.HOW DID THIS COME TO LIGHT?Nissan's Saikawa said Ghosn's alleged improprieties came to light through a whistleblower, after which the company began an internal investigation and informed prosecutors. Japanese media reports say the informant is a member of Nissan's legal department. The Asahi reported, without citing sources, that the informant gave the prosecutors information in a plea bargain, implying the person may have provided evidence in exchange for a lighter sentence.HOW MUCH CONTROL DID GHOSN HAVE?After becoming CEO of a struggling Nissan in 2001, Ghosn was hailed as the automaker's savior by implementing an aggressive cost-cutting plan. Known for his flair and confidence, Ghosn won respect for his business acumen and for shaking up Nissan's traditional corporate culture, which may have made it difficult to hold him accountable.Ghosn became CEO of Nissan partner Renault in 2005, chairman of Nissan of 2008 and chairman of Renault in 2009, giving him considerable sway over both companies. On Monday, Saikawa acknowledged that too much power had been concentrated in Ghosn. ""Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications,"" he said.France's finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday Ghosn should not remain in charge of Renault after his arrest in Japan.HOW COULD HE PULL OFF THIS ALLEGED DECEPTION?This is the big question. If the misconduct continued for years, as Saikawa said, analysts question how this could have passed undetected for so long, unless internal auditors and senior management turned a blind eye.WHAT'S NEXT FOR GHOSN?Under Japanese law, a suspect can be detained by prosecutors for up to 20 days before being charged or released. Tsutomu Nakamura, a former prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors office, predicted that Ghosn will be indicted on Friday, Dec. 7, the last working day before that maximum period.Ghosn is allowed access to a lawyer during his time in detention.If bail is granted, it would be ""exorbitant, in hundreds of millions of yen,"" or millions of dollars, Nakamura said. But in major cases like this, ""often no bail is granted until after the arraignment at the first court session"".Falsifying corporate annual reports, which Ghosn and Kelly are accused of, carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to 10 million yen, under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He was arrested and would be fired from Nissan's board this week, it said.Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Nissan's French partner,  Renault  (PA:RENA), and chairman of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the third partner in the alliance.Ousting Ghosn will pose questions about an alliance that he personally shaped and had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership.It also brings into focus the future of Nissan - the biggest partner in the alliance - at a time it is seeing falling profits due to weak U.S. sales and is facing heightened competition from rivals who are investing heavily in new growth areas like internet connected cars and self-driving vehicles.Ghosn's alleged improprieties also raise questions over governance at the alliance in which the three partners' boards are all chaired by a single executive.One Nissan headquartered manager told Reuters he was concerned decision making at the alliance, which vies with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp for the ranking of the world's biggest automaker, could slow due to the lack of a unifying figure.The manager, who declined to be identified as he was not permitted to speak to the media, said he was also worried Ghosn's departure could hit sales as fans of the charismatic leader abandon the company and corporate customers bound by compliance rules put orders on hold due to the scandal.Speaking at a late-night news conference on Monday, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, and that the implications of his stewardship of both Renault and Nissan had gone unquestioned since 2005.Prosecutors said in a statement that Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 as being about half of the actual 9.998 billion yen ($88.9 million).Ghosn joined Nissan in 1999 and became its CEO in 2001. He remained in that post until last year and had received 9.2 million euros ($10.53 million) in pay for the final year as CEO.""By under-reporting his corporate salary, he basically deprived Nissan's shareholders of opportunities to judge if the amount of his salary was appropriate,"" Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities Japan, said of Nissan's allegations.CEO Saikawa, a top ranking executive since 2011, emphasized that Nissan was a victim of Ghosn's alleged misdeeds but declined to say whether others besides Kelly at the automaker were involved in the wrongdoing.Nissan has been slow to strengthen its governance, with outside directors linked to the alliance or lacking business experience, said Zuhair Khan, head of Japan research at Jefferies. ""Even in poor governance Japan, Nissan under Carlos Ghosn stood out for bad governance structure,"" he said.LUXURY LIVING?Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Nissan paid billions of yen for the purchase and renovation of homes for Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources.The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in filings to the Tokyo bourse, NHK said. Saikawa declined on Monday to discuss specifics on Ghosn's personal use of company money.Nissan spent 2 billion yen on homes for Ghosn in Rio and Beirut via a Dutch subsidiary, with Kelly overseeing the transaction, the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources.There has been no comment from Ghosn or Kelly on the allegations and Reuters could not contact them for comment.In a sign of the broader political fallout, Hitoshi Kawaguchi, Nissan senior vice president handling government relations, met with Japan's top government spokesman on Tuesday, telling media he had requested good relations between Japan and France be maintained.The Asahi newspaper cited unnamed sources as saying a company employee gave prosecutors information on Ghosn in return for lighter treatment, the second instance of a plea deal in Japan - a system introduced in June.Nissan shares fell to a two-year low of 940 yen before closing down 5.5 percent at 950 yen.

""The problem of governance was significant,"" Saikawa said, confirming the arrest of Ghosn in Japan. ""Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications."" Saikawa, a long-standing lieutenant to Ghosn, said he could not give specifics on the personal use of company money but that the wrongdoing was serious and had gone on for years. Ghosn could not be reached for comment. ""To have so greatly violated the trust of many, I feel full of disappointment and regret,"" Saikawa told a late night news conference. ""It's not just disappointment, but a stronger feeling of outrage, and for me, despondency.""Saikawa took over as Nissan CEO from Ghosn last year. Ghosn once told reporters the two thought alike. Saikawa said he would propose at a board meeting on Thursday to remove Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also accused of financial misconduct. Kelly could also not be reached for comment. Renault shares tumbled 11 percent in Paris to be among the worst performing stocks in Europe (STOXX). Nissan's German-listed securities (TG:7201) dropped 10 percent. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government, Renault's top shareholder, would safeguard the long-term viability of the carmaker.""The key question for us is to ensure the stability of Renault and of the alliance between Renault and Nissan, so I am working on that with all the parties,"" he told reporters in Brussels after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.GOVERNANCE Known as ""Le Cost Killer"" for overseeing turnarounds that included cuts, Ghosn has remained popular in Japan despite pushing through massive job losses and recent controversy over his pay.Japanese media said Ghosn had reported about 10 billion yen ($88.9 million) of annual compensation as about 5 billion yen for several years.Ousting Ghosn, 64, is bound to raise questions about an alliance that he personally shaped and had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership.""It is hard not to conclude that there may be a gulf opening up between Renault and Nissan,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton, raising the prospect of a potential ""re-Japanization"" of Nissan and the end of the alliance.Citi analyst Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary said the share price reaction showed how important Ghosn was to the partnership, adding that the alliance had long undervalued Nissan shares held indirectly by Renault investors.""Ghosn is viewed as critical for value unlock,"" he added.Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Since 2016 Nissan has held a 34 percent controlling stake in its smaller Japanese rival, Mitsubishi.A statement from Mitsubishi said it would propose removing Ghosn from its board.Monday's news is likely to raise questions about Nissan's accountability at a time when Japan has been pushing companies for better governance. Recent cases of corporate malfeasance have hit companies including accounting irregularities at Toshiba Corp (T:6502) and data falsification and improper inspections by manufacturers including Nissan. The Asahi newspaper reported on its website that prosecutors had begun searching the offices of Nissan's headquarters and other locations on Monday evening.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Ghosn began his career at  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France, moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its CEO in 2001. Ghosn remained in that post until last year. In June Renault shareholders approved Ghosn's 7.4 million euro ($8.5 million) pay package for 2017.

U.S. Futures Point to Lower Open U.S. stock futures pointed to a weaker start to the holiday-shortened trading week, as investors watched further developments in the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China.Markets stateside will remain closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and Friday will be a half-session day on Wall Street.Market sentiment remained cautious in the wake of tension between U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Papua New Guinea over the weekend.At 5:35AM ET (1035GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures were down 55 points, or about 0.2%, the S&P 500 futures dipped 5 points, or around 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 6 points, or roughly 0.1%.On the earnings front, L Brands (NYSE:LB), Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN),  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU), Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), and Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) were among the major companies scheduled to report their latest quarterly financial results, as the third-quarter earnings season winds down.Elsewhere, European stocks started the week on the front foot, though gains were limited as  Renault  (PA:RENA) shares sank on media reports its CEO would be arrested on suspicion of under-reporting his salary.Earlier, stocks in Asia closed mostly higher.2. Apple Cuts iPhone ProductionApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.Lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and Apple's decision to offer more models has made it more difficult to anticipate the number of components and handsets the company needs, according to the paper.The iPhone maker shocked markets a few weeks ago with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter, prompting a number of suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.Shares, which ended last week down more than 5%, were down another 1% in pre-market hours to $191.55.3. Dovish Fed Knocks Dollar Away from equities, the dollar dipped against a currency basket, adding to Friday’s losses amid uncertainty over the pace of future U.S. interest rate hikes.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, edged down 0.15% to 96.21, its weakest level since Nov. 8.The dollar was shunned following dovish comments by Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida on Friday, who said he saw some evidence that global growth is slowing.Clarida also noted that U.S. interest rates are nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, and added the central bank needs to be data-dependent when hiking rates in the future.Separately, Dallas Fed head Robert Kaplan said Friday he is seeing a growth slowdown in Europe and China.The comments were seen as an indication that the Fed may pause its rates hikes sooner than had been anticipated.New York Fed President John Williams  will speak later on Monday and traders would be waiting to see if he echoes the same theme as his colleagues.Policymakers are widely expected to raise interest rates next month for what would be the fourth time in 2018 and currently have plans for three further rate hikes in 2019.In the bond market, U.S. Treasury prices edged lower, pushing yields higher across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield inching up to 3.09%.4. Brexit Turmoil PersistsUncertainty over a smooth Brexit deal remained at the forefront.British Prime Minister Theresa May will seek to win support from business leaders for her contentious draft European Union divorce deal on Monday as dissenters in her own party scrambled to trigger a leadership challenge.May will defend her plan, which sparked an exodus of senior ministers last week, in a speech to the CBI business lobby group's annual conference, saying Britain would embark on an intense week of Brexit negotiations to try to thrash out the details of its outline future relationship with the EU.""We now have an intense week of negotiations ahead of us in the run-up to the special European Council on Sunday,"" May will say, according to advance extracts.The EU is due to hold a summit to discuss the deal on Nov. 25.The pound inched up 0.2% to 1.2860 against the dollar (GBP/USD) and gained 0.2% against the euro to 0.8882 (EUR/GBP).5. Oil Climbs Amid OPEC Supply Cut HopesIn commodities, oil rose about 1% amid expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will cut production next month to tighten supply and prop up prices.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 51 cents, or roughly 0.9%, at $56.97 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures rose 21 cents, or 0.3%, to $66.97 per barrel.OPEC officials have been making increasingly frequent public statements that the cartel and its partners would start withholding crude in 2019 to support the market. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, wants the cartel to slash production by about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), according to reports last week.Despite that, market sentiment remains weak amid signs of surging U.S. oil production. Global oil prices have lost roughly a quarter of their value since early October in what has become one of the biggest declines since a price collapse in 2014, with surging supply and the specter of faltering demand scaring off investors."
377,"Nov 15, 2018 06:28PM ET",A slew of electric truck plans may deliver the goods for China's EV ambitions,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - Having just broken ground for a new factory in the southern Chinese province of Hunan, the head of electric car startup Singulato Motors has grand plans: build up to 50,000 electric vans per year and ride the crest of a wave for e-truck demand in China.For a growing number of automakers operating in the world's biggest vehicle market, it's time to invest in electric vans and trucks. They're convinced by increasingly stringent restrictions aimed at reining in pollution, generous subsidies as well as robust demand for light-duty trucks as e-commerce flourishes.""We think China's about to see an electric commercial vehicle revolution,"" Singulato co-founder Shen Haiyin told Reuters in an interview. ""In many ways, the EV future might arrive faster with commercial vehicles than passenger EVs."" Singulato, which is due to launch its first electric car by the middle of next year, hopes to open the e-truck plant by 2020 and quickly ramp up annual output to 50,000. Shen envisions two main models that would appeal to e-commerce and logistics firms: a small intra-city delivery van the size of the Ford Transit or the Toyota HiAce, and a delivery truck under 2 tonnes.Growing momentum for e-trucks could prove to be a tipping point for the electric vehicle, first in China and eventually worldwide - encouraging the mass adoption that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other EV makers are aiming to give rise to with passenger cars.""It's a new game,"" said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd and a former Chrysler executive. ""The advantages of electric vehicles become apparent when vehicles are deployed into transportation and logistics services fleets."" Impediments that come with electric vehicles, such as the high cost of the battery and cumbersome charging needs, could with a truck fleet be erased to make the total cost of operation cheaper than gasoline or diesel.Batteries could be designed smaller since routes would be predictable, charging stations and schedules could be deployed more strategically and as trucks are often operated around the clock, economies of scale could be achieved, Russo said.Foton, part of Beijing-based BAIC Group and China's biggest maker of light-duty trucks under 6 tonnes, is also looking at expanding further into electric delivery vans, people with knowledge of the matter said.In August, a group of Foton officials gathered in a small spartan office in low-rise building near Tokyo's posh Ginza district. Eager to develop a compelling mini delivery e-van, they had come to seek advice from a highly regarded engineer, now retired from a Japanese automaker.The officials, who believed that Japan's minicar technology could offer a good base for a low-cost van, wanted his input on how to design one that could be sold for as little as 50,000 yuan ($7,225), according to two people who were at the meeting.""That was a second visit since late last year,"" said one of the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""They're serious,"" he said.A representative for Foton declined to comment. Foton has some electric commercial vehicles on the market but volumes are still tiny with around 800 sold last year.BOXY AND PRACTICALWhile electric trucks may not grab the public imagination in the same way Tesla's electric vehicles have done, their advent has long been advocated by many auto experts.Skeptical of the merits of the industry's rush into long-range passenger cars, they believe battery electric technology, because of its heavy weight and the limits on driving ranges, has a more natural home in short-haul trucks. That's particularly so for intra-city delivery vans and trucks plying routes that are pre-determined or at least predictable.Last year, the number of electric light-duty commercial vehicles - both all-electric and plug-in hybrids - sold in China was roughly 200,000, about 6 percent of the market for trucks under 6 tonnes.Nissan Motor Co, one of the first global automakers in China to develop an e-truck line-up through its venture with Dongfeng Group, believes that demand for light-duty e-trucks will quadruple in four to five years. Its joint venture, Dongfeng Motor Co Ltd, is aiming to lift its electric commercial vehicle sales six times to 90,000 by 2022.Nissan's partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) is also on the case. Its new venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd plans to launch three electric delivery vans in two years, starting next year.Warren Buffet-backed BYD and Geely [GEELY.UL] also have some electric trucks and vans on the market, although volumes are still quite small.Growth in e-trucks fits hand in glove with efforts by Beijing and Chinese local authorities to promote electric vehicles - both to jump-start a domestic auto industry that lags global rivals in internal combustion engine technology and to combat smog - a constant source of public discontent.Subsidies, up to 100,000 yuan from the central government alone, are helping to propel the shift. Nissan's most popular electric commercial vehicle, the Dongfeng D94 van, is eligible for combined subsidies of up to about 80,000 yuan from the central government and regional authorities, knocking roughly a third off its purchase price.Nearly two dozen cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have put in place restrictions on fossil-fueled trucks coming into city centers. Beijing for instance last year banned heavier trucks from entering the city center between 6 a.m and 11 p.m. and next year will place further limits on diesel and some other commercial vehicles.""We're betting on the e-truck because pretty soon only e-truck and e-vans will be allowed to enter city-centers,"" a Nissan China executive said, declining to identified as he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. ""With the continued rise of e-commerce, we see a bright future in electric delivery vans.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""That's it. That's the double, mate. MercedesAMG are the world champs,"" Hamilton was told as he took the chequered flag at Interlagos after a race fraught with concerns about his tyres and engine.""It's been an incredible journey with them. This is what everyone worked for, for the whole year,"" said the ecstatic champion as the celebrations started with one race to go.""I've always told you how much of an honour it is to drive for them. Today was the best style that we could do it because we were struggling, we had problems to the end. We were a sitting duck at one stage.""Only the sport's oldest and most succesful team Ferrari have previously managed to win five championships in a row, taking six in succession during their golden Michael Schumacher era from 1999 to 2004.""It was a very difficult season, we had up and downs. Ferrari came back very strong and Red Bull at the end but that makes the championship victory even more enjoyable,"" said team boss Toto Wolff. Verstappen, winner in Mexico two weeks ago, joined Hamilton on the podium but the Dutchman knew he should have been on the top step.PUSHING AND SHOVINGThe collision was the talking point of the day, with arguments on both sides.Ocon was handed a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for causing it but that came as no consolation for Verstappen, whose colourful language over the radio was largely bleeped out for television viewers.When the Dutchman found Ocon, at the post-race scales, matters became more physical with the Red Bull driver caught on television confronting the young Frenchman and giving him a shove.""You do everything well, you go through the field, we had a great car and then by such an idiot you get taken out while he's being lapped. I have no words,"" said Verstappen.""You can easily say afterwards that I have much more to lose than him but I'm just trying to do my race. Suddenly, a backmarker is trying to race you and taking a stupid risk to dive inside. What can I do about it?""The penalty for me is that I lost the victory but hopefully in 15 years' time we can laugh about it.""Sauber's Ferrari-bound rookie Charles Leclerc was 'best of the rest', the Monegasque finishing seventh after running as high as fourth during the pitstops.Haas savoured a double points finish to close on fourth-placed  Renault  (PA:RENA), with Romain Grosjean eighth and Danish team mate Kevin Magnussen ninth.Ocon's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez took the final point for a team that had hoped for much more.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The move raises Renault's announced investment in France this year to 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion), the companies added.Under pressure from the French government, the carmaker's biggest shareholder, Renault boss Carlos Ghosn agreed this year to pursue a closer tie-up with Nissan in what is likely to be his last four-year stint as chief executive. Renault currently owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, which in turn holds a non-voting 15 percent stake in its French parent and 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors.Ghosn has previously said a full merger is possible only if France gives up its 15 percent Renault holding - a step the government has been reluctant to entertain without clearer safeguards on French jobs and other industrial interests.The investment will eventually boost Renault's sales to partners - one measure of its financial benefit from the alliance - which fell by 358 million euros in the last quarter, partly reflecting Europe's diesel sales decline.France was chosen for the vans investment because ""the Maubeuge and Sandouville factories offered the most attractive solution, thanks to their competitiveness"", Ghosn said.""Within the alliance, Renault Group's global expertise in light commercial vehicles generates synergies that benefit all of our customers,"" he added.The new Mitsubishi van will be exported from Sandouville to Australia and New Zealand, under the plans announced on Thursday. The new Kangoo and Nissan NV250 will bring 200 new jobs and 400 million euros of additional investment to Maubeuge, in addition to 50 million previously announced for the electric version.($1 = 0.8757 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

381,"Nov 06, 2018 03:43AM ET",Surprise rise in German orders eases growth concerns,nan,"By Michael NienaberBERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose unexpectedly in September, driven by bulk orders and higher demand from domestic and other euro zone clients, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting Europe's largest economy ended the third quarter on a solid footing.Orders edged up 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised increase of 2.5 percent in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. That beat market expectations for a fall of 0.6 percent.""The small increase is pushing growth concerns into the background,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger said. For the third quarter as a whole, industrial orders fell 1.0 percent on weak foreign demand, the Economy Ministry said. This suggests manufacturing hardly contributed to overall economic growth in the July-September period.""Bulk orders were the main driver behind the slight increase in September,"" DIHK economist Sophia Krietenbrink said.""Nevertheless, there is a clear downward trend for the first three quarters,"" she added. Krietenbrink said business sentiment was deteriorating due to international trade tensions, weaker global demand and higher energy and commodity prices.The Economy Ministry pointed to special factors in the automobile sector, where the introduction of new regulation has caused production delays.""The development of industrial orders in August and September suggests that bottlenecks in vehicle registration due to new testing rules for cars (WLTP) are slowly clearing up,"" the ministry said.The new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to halt deliveries of some models that had yet to be re-certified.The ministry said manufacturing was likely to propel growth in the fourth quarter as many companies are still enjoying an unusually high level of orders.The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data next week.Several economic institutes said last week the German economy probably shrunk in the third quarter after posting quarterly growth rates of 0.4 percent in the first and 0.5 percent in the second quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

382,"Nov 02, 2018 07:50AM ET","At Telematics crossroads, TomTom CEO plots next move",nan,"By Alexandria SageSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Digital mapmaking company TomTom (AS:TOM2) will consider whether to go it alone or pursue partnerships if it sells a fleet management business which may account for more than half its current value, its chief executive told Reuters.Dutch-based TomTom, which has a market capitalization of 1.75 billion euros ($2 billion), with no debt and 179 million euros in cash, hired  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in September to conduct a review of its ""Telematics"" division with an eye to possible sale.Working out a fair price for the division, which helps businesses to save money by using software to monitor and improve the performance of their car and truck fleets, might not be straightforward, Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said.Telematics, which had 43 million euros in sales in the third quarter, up 6 percent from a year ago, is ""a bit of a mystery"" for analysts, added Goddijn, one of the company founders.The division has grown quietly but quickly in the shadow of a company better known to consumers for making satnav devices -- a business in decline -- and to analysts for serving up the digital maps built into iPhone's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Maps app.With Telematics expected to post core earnings of 60-70 million euros this year, valuations of the business range hugely, from 700 million euros to 1.4 billion euros. Sell-side analysts disagree about what multiple of earnings the business, which seems likely to extend its steady but not spectacular growth, will fetch.Getting a good deal for Telematics would help to underpin the TomTom share price after recent volatility.""If you look at the sum of the parts and the valuation and market cap, there is something not quite right and that needs to be better explained,"" Goddijn said in an interview this week in San Francisco.TomTom, set up in 1991, helped to pioneer navigation devices mounted on dashboards but now competes with German-owned HERE and with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to sell digital maps integrated into the cars' own software and control panels.NEXT TURN?Goddijn declined to say what TomTom will do with proceeds if Telematics is sold, despite the dramatic change a disposal would have on the company's profile.TomTom shares are down 7 percent year to date after Google Maps entered its key market, supplying navigation and traffic software to carmakers. Google has so far poached several TomTom clients including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volvo.That's part of a broader pattern of carmakers and tech firms teaming up as they prepare for a long, expensive transition toward self-driving vehicles.This week alone it emerged that Ford and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), and Volvo and Baidu (O:BIDU) are in talks on partnerships to develop and commercialize self-driving car technology, in which maps will play an important role.""It's not clear what the right economic model is going to be going forward for delivering the next generation of mapping content to the vehicle: is it best to be independent? Is it best to team up? It will take time to figure that out,"" Goddijn said.He said he was confident TomTom's automotive software sales will continue to grow in the coming three years, but did not rule out a takeover or far-reaching partnership with a carmaker or larger technology firm.Goddijn and TomTom's three other founders hold a 44 percent stake in the Dutch company, which some investors fear means the company would never enter a deal that meant surrendering effective control.""There's always a big thing about founders and emotional attachments and what have you. I want to set the record straight,"" Goddijn said.""We will do whatever is right for the business and the people and the stakeholders and the customers like any other business, and we’ll look at how it will evolve.

Europe-China trade is also expected to benefit from increased U.S.-China tariffs and other barriers.The Trump administration in May withdrew Washington from an international agreement to curb Tehran’s nuclear activities, and imposed new sanctions against Iran. That triggered the mass withdrawal of European companies from carmakers to oil majors, in order to avoid crippling U.S. penalties reintroduced in stages on Aug. 6 and Nov. 4.European governments have pledged in response to establish new financing channels that shield companies from U.S. sanctions, but a viable program has yet to emerge. The comments by Lamy, who served as EU Trade Commissioner before heading the WTO, expanded on recommendations published in a policy paper http://institutdelors.eu/publications/leurope-face-aux-sanctions-americaines-quelle-souverainete/?lang=en last week by the Jacques Delors institute, a European think-tank.Europe could create its own extraterritorial mechanisms to sanction breaches of environmental, data protection, tax and anti-corruption laws, according to the paper co-authored by Lamy and four others including Louis Schweitzer, honorary chairman of carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA).Failing that, Brussels could use existing directives to halt the EU activities of foreign banks ""from a third country that imposes extraterritorial provisions on EU companies"", it said.""It cannot be ruled out that the United States will impose future sanctions on China that go beyond the current trade measures initiated by the American president, which could then be applied extraterritorially,"" the paper added.""Perhaps it would be wise to take decisions for the Iranian case by considering this wider economic and political context."""
384,"Oct 28, 2018 10:20AM ET",France will ask auto makers to fund new car trade-in payments,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will ask carmakers on Monday to help fund an expanded trade-in program to get older, polluting cars off the road with incentives for new ones, the French finance minister told daily Le Parisien on Sunday.The existing government-funded scrappage scheme, which mainly targets old diesel cars, is already oversubscribed.The widening of the incentive is partly funded by a hardening of the tax on polluting vehicles adopted on Tuesday, which should raise 40 million euros (35.5 million pounds) to reach a total of 610 million next year to finance contributions for the purchase of more environment-friendly cars.The minister's agenda says he will hold meetings with Environment Minister Francois de Rugy and carmakers, such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA, to ""discuss measures aimed at speeding up the vehicle fleet's ecological transition.""""With Francois de Rugy we will ask carmakers tomorrow to contribute to the conversion premium,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Parisien in an interview, adding that the incentive should be more efficient and reach more French people.The level of carmakers' contribution to the wider scheme would have to be discussed with them, he said.Newspaper Les Echos earlier this week said French carmakers were already discussing between them the implementation at their expense of a bonus for the conversion of old vehicles. The precise outlines remained under discussion.There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since leading German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has boosted investment in electric vehicles and incentives for green cars.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition partners agreed earlier this month on plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes.But carmakers had said the focus should instead be on encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at discounted prices.Volkswagen on Thursday said it will offer trade-in incentives and a bonus for scrapping older diesel vehicles in Germany.Separately, Le Maire dismissed calls to reduced taxes on fuel prices which have surged at French petrol stations after a spike in crude oil, saying this would contribute to climate change.France's 2019 budget includes an increase in diesel taxes of more than 6 cents per liter and those on gasoline by almost 3 cents, an increase that the government has tried to downplay, comparing it to soaring oil prices.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Downforce-wise you lose a lot of performance and then it’s more about mechanical grip and stuff... and I think our car is very good mechanically, anyway, also aerodynamically.""The championship situation could also play into Red Bull's hands, with leader Lewis Hamilton needing to score only five points to take his fifth title. The Briton will also take the title if Vettel fails to win on Sunday.A Verstappen victory would therefore be good for Hamilton, but the youngster expected Hamilton to be still focused on winning.""It will be close between them in qualifying and I think we will be a little bit behind but in the race we definitely have a chance,"" he said.""About Lewis, I think as a driver you always want to win so I don’t think that changes a lot.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

387,"Oct 24, 2018 04:40AM ET",Trade Woes Set Up Euro Economy for Disappointing Year-End,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Euro-area growth slowed to the weakest in more than two years at the start of the fourth quarter as manufacturers suffered from mounting concerns over global trade.The dismal reading for the Purchasing Managers’ Index comes a day before European Central Bank policy makers meet to review the risks facing the economy and their pledge to cap bond buying in December. Ebbing confidence could damp their optimism about momentum in the region.The composite PMI from IHS Markit dropped to 52.7 in October from 54.1 in September. The reading was below all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists, though it still indicates quarterly growth of 0.3 percent.The decline was led by manufacturing, where output growth was the weakest since December 2014. In Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, factory growth slowed sharply and the composite measure -- which includes services -- dropped to the lowest in more than three years. Phil Smith, an economist at IHS Markit, described the data as “unpleasant.”The market reaction was also clear, with the euro falling to the lowest in two months. It was down 0.5 percent to $1.1420 as of 10:32 a.m. Frankfurt time.“The survey will make for uncomfortable reading at the ECB,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at IHS Markit. “The headline PMI has fallen to a level which would historically be consistent with a bias toward loosening monetary policy.”Cutting ForecastsPart of the manufacturing weakness may reflect issues in the car industry, where production has been held up by new emissions tests, though some companies are also feeling the impact of emerging-market turmoil. In France,  Renault  (PA:RENA) this week lowered its market outlook for China.But Williamson said the slowdown is broadening and the threat of a trade war has “darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion.”Earlier this week, French IT firm Atos cuts its revenue guidance and said the global economic backdrop was becoming “more uncertain.” German manufacturer Leoni AG lowered its sales and earnings forecasts citing weaker Chinese demand and international trade conflicts.In the PMI, expectations of future growth slipped to the lowest level in almost four years and hit a near six-year low in manufacturing. As a result, companies slowed hiring.(Updates with chart, euro in fifth paragraph.)"

This would allow utilities to use electric cars as a backstop if demand rises.There will be 280 million electric vehicles by 2040, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency, compared with more than 3 million last year.""We strongly believe in an emission-free future,"" Guillaume Pelletreau, Vice President and Managing Director, Nissan Center Europe, said. ""Leaf batteries could make an important contribution to energy transition in Germany and a sustainable future.""The initiative was also supported by Daimler-backed The Mobility House, local utility Enervie and German transmission system operator Amprion, which is co-owned by RWE and infrastructure investors including Munich Re, Swiss Life and Talanx.Nissan has so far sold about 370,000 electric vehicles and, along with top shareholder  Renault  (PA:RENA), has been very active in exploring how car batteries can be integrated into the power system.While a mass uptake of EVs is expected to put a major strain on the power grid and require billions of euros in infrastructure investments, car batteries have already proven that they can become part of the network.Nissan is relying on the CHAdeMO charging standard, which competes with Tesla's supercharger system and the European-backed Combined Charging System.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

389,"Oct 23, 2018 05:00AM ET",Renault Quarterly Sales Decline on Emerging-Markets Plunge,nan,"(Bloomberg) --  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) reported a bigger drop in third-quarter sales than analysts expected, as turmoil in emerging markets from Turkey to Iran cut into business and currencies faltered in several key countries.The shares fell to the lowest in more than three years after the French carmaker said demand weakened in Turkey, Argentina and India, compounded by a pullout of Iran. Currency declines added to the carnage, including in Brazil and Russia. The company also cut its market outlook for China, where a slowing economy is dragging down car sales and Renault recently upped its presence.The results highlight Renault’s unique dependence on developing countries compared with other major carmakers. The company, based in Boulogne-Billancourt, counts Russia as its biggest market outside of France, and China is now fourth. That’s placed Renault in a tricky position as trade tension between the U.S. and China, as well as President Donald Trump’s activist foreign policy, rattle smaller economies. Renault had to stop doing business in Iran, and deliveries to Turkey halved in the three months to September.This quarter was “not an easy one,” Chief Financial Officer Clotilde Delbos told analysts during a conference call. Still, she said, the company is seeing improvement in Russia and Brazil, “which are offering us great opportunities.”While Renault only sold 72,100 vehicles in China last year out of a total of 3.8 million autos, it recently created a joint-venture with Jinbei and Huasong there to sell commercial vehicles. The company now sees the world’s largest automotive market growing by 2 percent this year, versus a previous forecast of 5 percent, it said Tuesday in a statement.Emission RulesThe carmaker also warned that new emission testing rules known as WLTP that entered into force last month added uncertainty on European car demand for the rest of the year. The new regulation is putting pressure on prices as dealers have been seeking to sell cars that didn’t comply with the rules.“The fourth quarter is still going to be impacted by WLTP,” Delbos said. “But I do not have any major concern for the underlying health, let’s put it that way, of countries like France, like Germany, and Spain.”Renault stuck to annual forecasts for operating return on sales to exceed 6 percent and to boost comparable revenue, which rose 4.4 percent since the start of the year.The shares were down 2.6 percent to 64.06 euros at 10:23 a.m. in Paris, after earlier falling to 62.27 euros, the lowest intraday since September 2015.Carmaker shares have buckled under weaker market conditions and trade tensions in recent months, prompting  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG to warn of lower profits.A slowdown in China, the engine room for carmaker growth for a number of years, is adding to concerns for the sector that’s already struggling with the costly shift to electric and self-driving cars. Purchases of passenger vehicles by dealerships plunged for a third straight month during September, as deepening trade tensions with the U.S. unsettle consumers. Car sales are barely up for the year, leaving the industry facing the prospect of a first contraction in sales since at least the 1990s.In Iran, where Renault sold almost 100,000 vehicles since the beginning of the year, deliveries were stopped as a result of U.S. sanctions, the company said. To compensate for that loss, the company is exploring new markets in Africa, including South Africa, Delbos said.Sector ConcernsRevenue at Renault fell 6 percent to 11.5 billion euros ($13.2 billion), compared with a forecast of 12.2 billion euros of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding a drag from currency impacts from emerging-market economies like Argentina and Brazil, revenue fell 1.4 percent.“Renault’s sales numbers were not too bad given where sentiment towards the space sits today,” Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with Evercore ISI, said in a note. “However, they are also unlikely to result in any positive sentiment shift either -- an inconclusive start to earnings season.”(Updates with CFO comments from fourth paragraph.)"
390,"Oct 22, 2018 05:40AM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/SEVEN DEADLY…The real possibility of the yuan weakening to the 7-per-dollar mark last seen in 2008, hangs over China, emerging markets and global equities. The thinking so far has been that the risk of capital outflows, along the lines of what happened in 2016, would dissuade Beijing from allowing such a slide in the currency. But more recently, weak benchmark yuan/dollar fixings, a drop in the trade-weighted yuan index to below 2017 lows, and a flurry of comments and measures from policymakers reveal both a sense of panic and determination to prop up the economy.With third-quarter economic growth slowing to crisis-era lows, no let-up in Washington's trade rhetoric and a stock market that's lost 28 percent since February, China has been forced to ease monetary conditions and is cajoling banks to lend to small firms. It has just announced tax cuts that could reach one percent of GDP next year.A weaker yuan would complement those efforts. Yet a 7-per-dollar yuan would erode faith in the China's stability and provoke more U.S. ire. And coming on top of rising U.S. yields, Brexit and Italian politics, it would add another layer of worry to world markets.  Lost in transmission: China's small firms get more loans on paper but not in reality –China central bank chief says plenty of room for monetary adjustments amid trade row -China's tax cuts next year expected to reach 1 pct of GDP China's policymakers pledge market support - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OyNcCL2/EUROPE'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE Stock market turmoil, conflict over a contentious Italian budget, high oil prices, sputtering economic growth -- not quite the backdrop a central bank wants to see three months before its it ends its stimulus program. But that is exactly what the European Central Bank faces when it meets on Thursday. For now, the heightened risks to the growth outlook are not expected to derail its plans to end QE by year-end, but the bank could downgrade the growth risk assessment in its policy statement.That would be a dovish signal and one likely to cheer euro zone bond markets which have been guided already to not expect a rise in the ECB's record low rates until well into 2019. No wonder then, that the gap between short-dated bond yields in the United States and Germany are at their widest in 30 years, while 10-year euro area bond yields (with the exception of Italy) have been largely insulated from the recent spike U.S. Treasury yields.

391,"Oct 21, 2018 08:13PM ET",Motor racing: Raikkonen puts Hamilton's fifth title on hold,nan,"By Alan BaldwinAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton was made to wait for his fifth Formula One world championship on Sunday after the Mercedes driver finished only third in a U.S. Grand Prix won by Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) veteran Kimi Raikkonen.The victory was the 21st of the 39-year-old Finn's career and first since the Australian Grand Prix of March 2013, a gap of 113 races dating back to when he was racing for now-defunct Lotus.Red Bull's Dutch youngster Max Verstappen took a surprise second after starting 18th in a thrilling finale with the top three cars running nose-to-tail and separated by just 2.1 seconds at the chequered flag.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, Hamilton's only title rival, spun down to 15th on the opening lap but fought back to finish fourth -- a result that means the championship remains mathematically open going into Mexico next weekend.Hamilton, on 346 points, has a lead of 70 over his four-times champion rival with a total of 75 remaining to be won from the last three races.That means even if Vettel wins in Mexico, the Briton need finish only seventh to be sure of the title but Sunday was still a missed opportunity for Mercedes, who got their tire strategy wrong.""I actually thought we would have been able to do better but this is the best we were able to do in the end,"" said Hamilton. ""We just have to keep working and keep pushing for the next race.""I'm not really quite sure how the strategy ended up like that,"" added the Briton, who had started on pole position but lost the lead to Raikkonen into the first corner at a sunny Circuit of the Americas.LATE CHARGEHamilton pitted early during a virtual safety car period but had to make two pitstops to his rivals' one, losing time on fading tires before being called in. A late charge over the final 19 laps from fourth was not enough.Team mate Valtteri Bottas helped by letting him through for third, but the Finn then lost out to Vettel as his tires wore down and finished fifth. Hamilton went wheel-to-wheel with Verstappen with two laps left but failed to make the move stick and ran wide at turn 18 after giving the Dutchman plenty of space.""Did you win the championship?"" enquired 2007 world champion Raikkonen, whose last previous win with Ferrari was in 2009, in the cool-down room.""No,"" replied Hamilton.The outcome had looked very different at the start, when Vettel, fifth on the grid, spun on the opening lap after making contact with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in the battle for fourth place.It was the second time in two races that the German had come off worse against a Red Bull -- in Japan he had started eighth, dropped to 19th after a collision with Verstappen and fought back to sixth -- and he seemed to have handed the title to Hamilton.Instead, he staged a solid recovery drive to delay the inevitable. ""I'm happy for Kimi, really. Tough weeks for the team and the tough times don't seem to be stopping for me. It should have been a better day,"" said Vettel.Ricciardo, who is leaving for  Renault  (PA:RENA) at the end of the season, made it easier for him by retiring with a power unit failure after eight laps while in fourth place.""He’s taken out his frustration in his room by putting his fist through the wall, which you can totally relate to,"" team boss Christian Horner told reporters later.AMATEUR DRIVERSRenault's Nico Hulkenberg finished sixth, ahead of Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz, with Force India's Esteban Ocon eighth before being disqualified for a fuel breach.So too was Kevin Magnussen, ninth across the line for the U.S.-owned Haas team.Their removal from the results lifted Force India's Mexican Sergio Perez to eighth, with Toro Rosso's Brendon Hartley ninth and Sauber's Marcus Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) 10th.McLaren's Fernando Alonso retired after an opening lap collision with Williams' Lance Stroll, who was handed a drive-through penalty.""I drive in another series with amateur drivers, theoretically, and there has never been a problem,"" said the angry Spaniard, who also races in the World Endurance Championship.

394,"Oct 19, 2018 07:20AM ET",Volkswagen a winner as EU set to favour wifi over 5G: draft,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to approve and set rules for the use of wifi in cars, giving Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) who have pursued this technology the edge over Daimler and others who invested in rival 5G networks.The EU executive is expected to announce draft legislation on the issue next month for feedback from EU countries and EU lawmakers before adopting it next year.The decision is a crucial one for both carmakers and telecoms operators and equipment makers as the market for internet connected cars is expected to be worth billions of euros a year.While connected cars have been available for some years in Europe, the Commission wants to speed up their deployment and encourage cooperation between manufacturers to make safer and more efficient cars via legislation.Such legal protection and regulatory-approved technical specifications would also reassure car buyers and auto insurance companies, advantages which cars equipped with a rival technology would not have.The latest draft of the proposed rules seen by Reuters paves the way for cars equipped with wifi called ITS-G5 to hit the roads in Europe while regulators will review the rules at the latest three years after its implementation to take into account any new technologies.This could mean that the alternative 5G standard called C-V2X could take months or even years to win approval. Supporters however expect a shorter timeframe.RIVAL CAMPSThe issue has pitted two powerful groups of carmakers, chipmakers and telecoms providers against each other. Connected cars are seen as lucrative targets for online retailers and advertisers.Volkswagen, Renault, NXP, Autotalks and Kapsch TrafficCom are pushing ITS-G5, which they say has been sufficiently tested and fully standardised in European government-funded projects.However, 5G backers include big names like Daimler, Ford, PSA Group, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Huawei [HWT.UL], Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Samsung (KS:005930). They say that C-V2X has wider application and is future-proof.Backers of C-V2X say it can hook up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, with a wider range of applications in areas such as entertainment, traffic data and general navigation where data speeds or signal failure are less of an issue.Fans of ITS-G5, which is primarily for connecting cars to other cars, say it is better for time-critical communications involved in crash avoidance and object navigation. The EU executive declined to comment on the draft. It said: ""Currently the Commission is looking into the best European framework to promote the right investments in this area and ensure interoperability between the existing systems and the development of new technologies.""In effect, the decision puts the region at loggerheads with the United States and China which see C-V2X, using cellular networks, as the way forward.Some EU countries such as Spain, Sweden, Finland and Norway had called for a postponement of the proposed rules because of the diverging views on the topic.Following intense lobbying, France, which supports the wifi-based technology, came up with a compromise clause which is now under discussion.Its proposal, seen by Reuters, would force the Commission to revise the rules in less than 12 months if a new technology is approved. The paper also calls for all involved parties to cooperate to ensure a level playing field between different technologies.Lobbying group and C-V2X supporter 5GAA said that is not enough.""A legislation confined to a wifi based communication would send a negative message about Europe's commitment to 5G, and is contrary to the objectives of the Commission's own 5G action plan, which aims to promote early deployment of 5G along major transport paths,"" 5GAA said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's DAX (GDAXI) index turned negative, weighed by losses in the trade-exposed auto sector, which fell 1.2 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it viewed the third quarter as a challenging time for the industry. Disappointing results from Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG) also weighed.""We still have a lot of uncertainty...

If we manage to steer through the reporting season quite okay, then the markets too may get a lift,"" he said. ASML (AS:ASML) shares rose 5.9 percent after the Dutch equipment supplier to computer chipmakers posted a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly earnings, easing worries over a slowdown in the semiconductor market. ING analysts called the results ""a very comforting update"". The company said demand for memory and logic chips remains healthy and it expects further growth in 2019. That helped to lift shares in other tech companies and sent their sectoral index (SX8P) up 1.8 percent.Among top gainers following results were also UK publisher  Pearson  (L:PSON) and paints maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO), both up around 3 percent, while drugs giant Roche (S:ROG) was flat after a modest sales beat in the third quarter.

Yoghurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO) also disappointed. Its shares fell 3.5 percent after quarterly sales growth slowed sharply, reflecting falling sales of its infant formula products in China and troubles from a consumer boycott in Morocco.In autos, shares in  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) fell between 2.3 and 1 percent.Overall, European third-quarter earnings are expected to rise 13.6 percent, slightly down from the 14 percent growth expected last week, according to Refinitiv IBES data, as analysts have been downgrading their forecasts.

That fed fears of critics who said a deal Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) made last month with  Renault  (PA:RENA), another TomTom customer, meant the company risked being relegated to third place in its main market, with lower margins.Shares extended early losses after TomTom chief executive Harold Goddijn, on a call with analysts after the company announced forecast-beating third-quarter earnings, attributed customer defections to user experience rather than purely price. ""I think it's on user experience, that's the key driver for [customers] making the switch,"" he said.TomTom shares were down 13.2 percent at 6.22 euros at 1435 GMT, while Amsterdam's benchmark AMX midcap index was up 1.5 percent.ING analysts said in a trading note that they believe the Swedish carmaker had switched to Google, rather than the current leading player in built-in mapping systems, HERE.""Now that Google is making inroads, the mapping business has become a three-player market with TomTom, HERE and Google, which is clearly less attractive for TomTom than the two-player market it was before,"" they said. A Volvo spokeswoman said it had not confirmed any new contract with Google, but repeated the company's statement from May that it intends to embed Google Maps in its next generation 'infotainment' systems.Earlier on Tuesday TomTom reported a rise in core earnings to 62.4 million euros ($72.2 million) from 35.5 million euros a year earlier.A company-compiled consensus had seen earnings for the quarter before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) at 41 million euros.Group sales were fractionally higher year-on-year at 220 million euros. While sales of the company's traditional satellite navigation devices continued to fall, that was offset by rising sales to carmakers and map licensing to customers including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Uber [UBER.UL]. The company raised its full-year revenue outlook to 850 million euros from 825 million euros. TomTom this month announced plans to sell its fleet management business, saying it would instead focus its energy on making digital maps used in highly automated driving.Goddijn said there was ""strong interest"" among buyers for the fleet subsidiary, which is valued at roughly 700 million euros.He declined comment on what the debt-free TomTom might do with proceeds.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The joint venture will start small with initial capital of 2 billion yen ($17.5 million). SoftBank will own just over half of the business, which will initially focus on Japan and eventually go global. ""SoftBank alone and automakers alone can't do everything,"" said Junichi Miyakawa, chief technology officer at SoftBank Corp who will be CEO of the new company. ""We want to work to help people with limited access to transportation.""The partnership will see Toyota and SoftBank work together to develop the automaker's multi-purpose mobility service based on its ""e-Palette"" concept announced earlier this year, in which Toyota plans to produce the hardware and software for convoys of shuttle bus-sized, self-driving multi-purpose vehicles used, for instance, as pay-per-use mobile restaurants and hotels. The joint company will be called MONET, short for mobility network, and will roll out an autonomous driving service using e-Palette by the second half of the 2020s, the companies said. SoftBank will provide technology to collect and analyze transportation data to ensure cars are efficiently dispatched when and where they're needed, they said.""Toyota is hoping to increase its revenues by combining its own data with the data and expertise which SoftBank has culled from its mobile phone operations,"" said Koji Endo, senior analyst at SBI Securities. ""The new company will enable SoftBank to widen its partner network, and it could be hoping to take a lead in developing platforms (for new transport services).""A slew of automotive technology-related deals and discussions have already resulted in myriad pairings between global automakers, ride-hailing companies and major tech firms.Honda Motor (T:7267) said on Wednesday it would invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co's (N:GM) Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, in which SoftBank is also an investor.On the same day,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) said they may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services.NUTS AND BOLTS The partnership between the two Japanese companies reflects SoftBank's growing influence in the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, which has been accelerated by its investments via the almost $100 billion Vision Fund. It is also a vote of confidence from SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has been critical of Japan for lagging overseas rivals, in Toyota's vision for the future of cars. ""He has an image of the future,"" Son told a media briefing, referring to Toyota President Akio Toyoda. ""Automobiles are becoming a cluster of semiconductors, not screws, bolts and nuts.""While both firms have been independently developing technologies for self-driving vehicles and car sharing, and each have investments in ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], Grab and Didi Chuxing, this is first time they have come together.Toyota Executive Vice-president Shigeki Tomoyama said the partnership came after SoftBank's widespread presence in the ride-hailing industry became apparent - it holds major stakes in the ride-hailing firms it had invested in and played a consolidating role in that industry. Toyoda joked about rumors that the two companies did not get along, and recalled rejecting a business proposition from Son 20 years ago, when SoftBank had yet to make its name as one of the world's largest technology investors.

That puts Cruise in a league with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo unit in terms of resources and aggressive plans to launch commercial services.Honda has also been in talks with Waymo about a possible collaboration for two years. While no deal has been announced, an agreement between the two to discuss integrating Waymo's self-driving technology into Honda vehicles still stands, a spokeswoman for the automaker told Reuters.Honda, which has lagged many of its rivals in developing self-driving vehicles, is paying $750 million upfront for the equity stake in GM's Cruise and will contribute another $2 billion over 12 years in development work and fees, the companies said on Wednesday.The deal calls for Honda to provide engineering expertise, and extends cooperation between the pair in a technology that has enormous costs and risk but no market-ready products.Other global automakers are forging similar alliances to share the uncertainty and huge price of developing technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance.Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and SoftBank said on Thursday they were teaming up to develop car services that rely on self-driving technology.In May, SoftBank said it would buy stakes in Cruise totaling 19.6 percent for $2.25 billion.Where SoftBank is primarily a financial partner, ""we view Honda as a strategic investor"", sharing in vehicle, systems and business development with GM, RBC analyst Joseph Spak wrote in an investor note.In a blog post early Wednesday, Cruise Chief Executive and co-founder Kyle Vogt joked: ""Honda is joining the party. They’re bringing chips, dip, and $2.75 billion.""Vogt told Reuters that Cruise and Honda would design a vehicle intended to be autonomous rather than the modified sedan with a steering wheel and driver controls that it is working on.""We're still shooting for 2019 to have the first version or first wave of vehicles that come out on our own platform. This is what comes after that,"" he said.2019 REMAINS THE GOALHonda's investment boosts the value of Cruise to $14.6 billion, about a third of GM's $48 billion market cap. GM acquired the San Francisco-based startup in March 2016 for a reported $1 billion.By comparison, analysts have pegged the value of Waymo as high as $175 billion.In a media briefing on Wednesday, GM President Dan Ammann said 2019 ""remains the goal"" for GM Cruise to launch a self-driving ride services fleet.He added: ""The longstanding relationship we have with Honda will allow us to move very quickly in ramping up our efforts.""GM shares closed up 2 percent on Wednesday. Honda shares were little changed on Thursday.In January, GM filed a petition seeking U.S. approval for a fully self-driving car, one without a steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal, to enter the automaker's first commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019.Ammann declined on Wednesday to provide a more specific timeline for the vehicle.GM has been ""very selective"" in its approach to investors in Cruise and ""we will evaluate other investment opportunities as they come along"", he said.Ammann later told analysts: ""We're moving as quickly as we can to get to the point where we can initially deploy the technology and then scale it ... This is an effort that requires very, very significant resources to pull off.""Ammann said Honda will contribute its engineering know-how and will help GM Cruise build a global ride services business.Honda executive Seiji Kuraishi said: ""This investment is based on a shared vision and their (GM's and Cruise's) superior technologies in this area.""GM Cruise has a test fleet of more than 100 self-driving versions of the Chevrolet Bolt, rebadged as Cruise AV.GM CEO Mary Barra said the automaker is still focused on testing self-driving vehicles in San Francisco before expanding to other markets.RUSH FOR TIE-UPSGM Cruise and Waymo are often described as leading the pack of technology and auto companies competing to create self-driving cars and integrate them into ride services fleets.Waymo has agreements with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] to buy and equip tens of thousands of vehicles with its self-driving systems.Other automakers are exploring similar tie-ups to help mitigate risk and cost, according to Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs, who said the GM-Honda deal ""demonstrates that global partnerships like these ... are necessary to take on these expensive ventures that likely will not return a profit in the near term.""BMW (DE:BMWG), which has a development partnership with suppliers  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Aptiv PLC (N:APTV) and Magna International (TO:MG), expects some rivals and ride services companies to join its consortium for developing self-driving cars as auto industry profits come under increasing pressure, board member Klaus Froehlich said on Tuesday.At the Paris Auto Show on Wednesday, the heads of  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) said the two companies may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services.The GM-Honda announcement extends a partnership that includes joint development of electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020. In June, Honda also said it would buy advanced batteries from GM in a move that could significantly reduce the cost of future electric vehicles at both automakers after 2020."

Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes cars, has said it could consider hardware retrofits but would concentrate on trade-in incentives of up to 5,000 euros ($5,755), Scheuer told a news conference.""We are talking about a significant billion (euro) contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,"" said Scheuer.Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown.""We are creating the framework to avoid driving bans but we expect the car industry to offer possible retrofits and trade-ins,"" German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said.""My impression is that the car industry has a big interest in restoring the image of diesel.""""END OF ERA""Environmental group Greenpeace said the German government had failed to provide a solution for the diesel crisis and accused the industry of exploiting the situation.""The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,"" it said.The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is Euro 6.France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) said earlier on Tuesday it was offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives of up to 10,000 euros to trade in their cars for newer ones.""We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,"" Renault Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight.""It’s the end of the game,"" he added.There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4 standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5 million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from the German KBA transport authority.Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather than a trade-in.PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Opel unit rejected hardware retrofits, arguing they were economically not sensible and the technology not fully developed.The German courts have paved the way for city driving bans to tackle levels of nitrogen oxide that exceed European safety levels.The city of Hamburg banned older diesels from two of its roads in May, and a ban in Frankfurt, the financial capital, is due to take effect next February.($1 = 0.8684 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

408,"Oct 02, 2018 07:30AM ET",Ghosn turns to Japanese to deflect Renault-Nissan succession question,nan,"By Joseph WhitePARIS (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, head of the world's largest automotive alliance by sales, gets a lot of questions about who could replace him, and at the Paris auto show on Tuesday he used a fresh way to postpone an answer.""I'm in nemawashi mode,"" Ghosn told reporters at a briefing at Renault's stand at the show, using a Japanese term for engaging a group of people to reach consensus on a course of action. Ghosn said the deliberations would take into account ""what kind of organization, legal structure ... we need to put in place to ensure the sustainability of the alliance.""Ghosn, 64, has said he plans to remain as  Renault  chief executive and CEO of the alliance until 2022. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, he said answers about succession and potential changes to the cross-shareholding structure of the three main partners should come by June 2020, the midpoint of his term.France's Renault SA (PA:RENA), and Japan's Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), are joined by cross shareholdings and shared activities such as purchasing and technology development. They operate separately in global markets, in certain cases as rivals. Together, the companies are on track to sell more than 11 million vehicles this year, Ghosn said.Ghosn was instrumental in forging the Renault-Nissan alliance two decades ago, taking a then-unconventional approach to engineering economies of scale without a full merger. His record gives him ""legitimacy in every one of these companies,"" he said. He is chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi.The future management and capital structure of the alliance has been a subject of increasing speculation among investors. Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Since 2016, Nissan has held a 34 percent controlling stake in its smaller Japanese rival, Mitsubishi. Complicating matters for Ghosn and the other shareholders is the French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault. Earlier this year, people familiar with the companies said Nissan was in talks to acquire the French government stake, but a deal never materialized. German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) also has a number of joint vehicle and technology partnerships with members of the alliance. Ghosn and Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche are scheduled to discuss their partnerships at a Paris auto show press conference on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

410,"Oct 01, 2018 12:51PM ET",Electric cars cast growing shadow on profits,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers. Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.""What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of  Peugeot , Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (DE:BMWG), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.""Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday.On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros.PRICED TO PUSHAfter declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2.Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.""Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.Volkswagen and Mercedes parent  Daimler , which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years.COST GAPElectric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.Mass-market electrics such as the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Zoe and Nissan (T:7201) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (O:TSLA) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify investment at all - it's all regulation.""Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), a major manufacturer of electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot even though the market doesn't exist.""SCALE EFFECTSCarmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen.Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,"" Salvat said.German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind.""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""($1 = 0.7675 pounds) Shortfall of planned European battery supply for electric vehicles (EV) https://tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOXGlobal electric-battery vehicle sales. https://tmsnrt.rs/2oDPjG4^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

411,"Sep 27, 2018 10:20AM ET",Motorcycle companies in India's 'Detroit' hit by strike over wages,nan,"By Sudarshan Varadhan and Aditi ShahNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers at motorbike companies including Yamaha Corp (T:7951) and  Eicher Motors  (NS:EICH) are on strike in the southern Indian city of Chennai, demanding better wages and a right to form unions to defend their interests.Employees said the companies had employed a large number of contract workers to get around rigid Indian labor laws that make it difficult to hire and fire full-time staff and have refused to bring them on company payrolls even after years of contract work.The unrest is the latest to hit the state of Tamil Nadu, dubbed the Detroit of South Asia because big automakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Hyundai (KS:011760), Ford (N:F), Nissan (T:7201) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have factories in the state.""Our main demands concern low wages, contract employees not being made permanent and workers being denied basic respect,"" said S Kannan, Kanchipuram district president at the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, one of the leaders involved in organizing the strike at Yamaha.Kannan said that talks to resolve the strike had made no progress.A spokesman at Yamaha, which sells in India as well as overseas, said that production is running below capacity.Yamaha has a 4 percent share of India's two-wheeler market. It sold about 793,000 motorcycles in the past financial year and exported about 252,000.Wages are low in India, making it an attractive manufacturing and export hub for companies, but workers feeling the effects of rising inflation have been agitating in recent years for higher pay.""The issue is not widespread. It is in pockets, but it is a cause of concern, especially since it is an industrial belt,"" said an executive at a global automaker.In May protests turned violent at metals conglomerate Vedanta's copper smelter about 400 miles from Chennai over alleged environmental violations that the company said underlined the risks global businesses face in India.The government has tried to overhaul labor laws, hoping to create millions of new jobs and boost economic growth by making it easier to hire and fire, but has faced resistance.Workers at Eicher Motors, which owns the Royal Enfield motorcycle company, are protesting one such scheme, the National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), said R Sampath, vice-president of the Royal Enfield Employees Union.""The scheme stops contract workers from becoming permanent employees, allows management to keep wages low and fire people with one-month's notice,"" said Sampath, adding that contract workers do not receive other employee benefits.Royal Enfield, which has about a 4 percent share of the two-wheeler market and sold more than 800,000 motorcycles in India over the past financial year, is ""hopeful of arriving at a mutually beneficial solution"", it said in a statement. ""We have forums that address matters related to the wellbeing of workmen and are working to understand the issue that compelled a few workmen to refrain from reporting for work today,"" the company said.Eicher Motors competes with U.S. motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) in India."
412,"Sep 27, 2018 06:50AM ET",TomTom plans fleet-management sale to focus on maps battle with Google,nan,"By Toby SterlingAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - TomTom is considering selling its fleet-management business to concentrate on competing head-to-head with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in car navigation software, it said on Thursday.Shares in the Dutch company jumped by 17 percent to 7.25 euros on the news, but that only recovered about half of the one-day loss suffered last week when Google announced a far-reaching supply deal with a group of carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and Mitsubishi.TomTom said it has begun a strategic review of its telematics division, which helps businesses to save money by using software to monitor and improve the performance of their car and truck fleets and has been valued by analysts at about 700 million euros ($820 million). Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said the threat posed by Google played no role in TomTom's decision and the company wants to concentrate on selling navigation, traffic and other software to carmakers.""I want to focus the united company behind that goal, give the company a clearer profile,"" he told Reuters. ""It's true that today it's a more bumpy ride, but that's what we like, that's what we're good at.""LOSING GROUND?Some analysts have said that TomTom, which is debt-free but barely profitable, will be relegated to third place in its main market. They say it will be left trailing behind both Google and market leader Here Technologies, which is owned by the three biggest German carmakers. ""That's not a scenario we're planning for,"" Goddijn said, adding that carmakers should be wary of becoming dependent on Google software.""I'm confident the car industry will get together and say what's going on here?. The car industry is notorious for not allowing single-source components into its development chain.""Goddijn said he could not comment on how TomTom would use proceeds from a sale of the telematics business, but a cash injection would clearly be welcome for a company that spends more than 100 million euros a year to maintain and develop its mapping technology.ING analysts, who rate TomTom shares a buy, said a sale of the telematics division could be a precursor to further strategic moves.""We believe the door is still wide open for a partnership of TomTom with an industry player in automotive,"" they said in a note, citing Toyota as a possible partner.TomTom's revenue from map licensing is expected to grow for at least the coming year, with deals made in 2016 with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and others offsetting a broader decline in group sales because of its declining satnav hardware business.TomTom also supplies maps for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Uber.($1 = 0.8540 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

414,"Sep 24, 2018 11:30AM ET","As U.S. sanctions near, Europe fails to protect Iran deal",nan,"By John Irish and Robin EmmottUNITED NATIONS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - At a meeting in Washington after Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May, a senior U.S. official told European diplomats that their efforts to save the deal by protecting EU investment in the Islamic republic were pointless.""You can't,"" the official said, and with just six weeks until the next wave of U.S. sanctions hits Iran on Nov. 4, European diplomats acknowledge he was right.The European Union has failed to design a workable legal shield for its companies in Iran to beat the global reach of the U.S. financial system and defy President Trump, the diplomats say. Instead, Europe is engaging with Russia and China to show that it is at least searching for ways to ensure Tehran gets some benefits from its oil sales so Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has a reason to keep to the accord, according to seven European officials and diplomats.Facing a collapsing economy at home, Rouhani is in a bind as he addresses the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, pressed by hardliners to abandon the 2015 deal as its economic benefits evaporate.EU-Iranian trade this year is running at 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) a month, but this is expected to fall as big European companies pull out and Iranian oil exports are choked off by U.S. sanctions.European heavyweights Peugeot,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Airbus are among companies that have pulled out of Iran since May, while Air France and British Airways have also now ended operations after falling traffic.Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk will stop shipping Iranian oil.The accord, signed in Vienna by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China, Russia and Iran, lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, designed to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear bomb.Trump says the deal, the biggest foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, failed to stop Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in wars in Yemen and Syria.Britain, France and Germany say abandoning the pact does not address U.S. security concerns and instead threatens stability in the Middle East. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.The U.S. Treasury is reimposing sanctions on Iran's energy, auto and financial sectors in two phases, starting this August.The EU has tried to neutralize the U.S. penalties with measures such as euro-denominated finance lines and a law that could make it an offense for EU citizens to comply with U.S. sanctions. But these have not reassured companies that they would be protected against U.S. fines or risks to their U.S.-based activities if they did business in Iran, diplomats said.""If you decide to do business with an enemy of the United States of America, you will not being doing it with the United States,"" said a U.S State Department official. ""You will not have access to the U.S. financial system.""Americans diplomats say the anger that EU diplomats showed in their May meetings with State Department officials in Washington has faded. The Europeans are beginning to grudgingly accept their failure to shield European investment in Iran from U.S. sanctions, the American envoys in Europe say.""When the sanctions really start to hurt at the end of the year, it will make it much harder because what we will have on the table won't be enough,"" said one senior European diplomat. COLD WAR REDUXThe European Commission's boldest idea is for European central banks to pay Iran directly for oil in euros and bypass the U.S. financial system. But it has so far proved too politically sensitive at both the European Central Bank and Germany's Bundesbank, two diplomats said. In Luxembourg, the European Investment Bank, the bloc's lending arm, rejected lending to EU companies in Iran for fear of jeopardizing its ability to raise money on U.S. markets.Now Berlin, Paris, London and Brussels are working on a barter system once used by Moscow during the Cold War to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands, using a so-called special purpose vehicle - a company set up to handle the business.Such a system could appeal to Asian countries that purchase Iranian oil, such as India, which had contacted Brussels about avoiding U.S. sanctions. But diplomats say its complexity is evidence that the European powers are cornered. ""It's very complicated and I think it would only work in a limited way,"" a senior European diplomat said on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.Another European diplomat echoed that, saying: ""By the end of the year, we hope to have some of these (proposals) in place and by then we'll have seen November 4 pass and only then we will see whether what we can do will have any impact."" In a sign of the obstacles, the European Union's focus has also shifted to the longer term to try to overcome a perception that European policy is held hostage by the U.S. treasury.Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed promoting the euro as a global currency to challenge the dollar, potentially allowing oil to be priced on world markets in euros. But economists said that China has sought a global role for its renminbi currency for years without success.""There should be no illusion that we are talking about slow, tectonic changes,"" said Nicolas Veron, an economist at Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel. EUROPEAN 'SWIFT'?The European Commission had also been in talks with Japan to avoid U.S. measures, but Tokyo looks set to stop importing Iranian crude by mid-October after the United States ruled out granting waivers from sanctions to any country.Meanwhile, the United States is pressing to cut Iran out of the Belgian-based SWIFT global payment network that facilitates the bulk of the world's cross-border money transactions, as it was in 2012 before the nuclear deal.Although the United States does not hold a majority on SWIFT's board of directors, the Trump administration could threaten to sanction bankers working at there, diplomats said.""If you threaten maximum pressure, then it implies no waivers, no softening of the position, no loopholes so it’s only a matter of time,"" said a senior French official.Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in August called for a SWIFT-style system independent of Washington, but officials say that is another longer-term, complex project to consider.Through what one Western official called ""strategic messaging"", Europe hopes that by showing Tehran that capitals are working intensively on measures to keep European investment flowing into Iran, the Islamic Republic will stick to the terms of the nuclear accord and avoid doing anything rash.""I think that the symbolism is the most important thing at this point,"" said Sanam Vakil, a senior associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based international think tank.Berlin, Paris and London ""don't have the political strength and time to be able to offer Iran anything serious or significant,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But there are broader effects, with the OECD saying this week that global growth may have hit a plateau.That warning came the same week that the U.S.-China trade war deepened, with Beijing saying it will retaliate against President Donald Trump’s order for more tariffs on imports from the Asian nation.Trade tensions are “a real and true concern for our business because we’re always thinking of long-term cycles,”  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) CEO for trucks Martin Daum said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. “We depend on long-term stability.”Automakers are Europe’s worst performing sector over the past six months, down more than 10 percent, versus a 2 percent gain for the Stoxx 600 Index.In China, car sales dropped for a third straight month in August, as slowing economic growth are threatening to end the vehicle market’s almost three-decade expansion.“The problem in China is the sentiment,” Klaus Rosenfeld, chief executive officer at a German industrial and autoparts supplier Schaeffler Group, said Thursday. “There is negative sentiment, and I think the trade war, the tariff discussion fuels this.”Trade tensions are hanging over the whole industry, from trucks to luxury sports vehicles, with  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE) CEO Louis Camilleri telling analysts on an earnings call this week that he hopes that “rationality would prevail,” because a “tariff war between Europe and U.S. would be quite dramatic.”And weaker demand for cars will have a fallout on other manufacturers. In Markit’s survey for France -- home to  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) -- it said “anecdotal evidence suggested that many manufacturers saw a reduction in demand from the automotive sector.”In September, the weakness in the euro-area PMI was all due to manufacturing, with the measure for services rising to a three-month high. Markit said the combined index points to a quarterly expansion of about 0.5 percent.But, according to Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson, weaker readings for backlogs and exports means “the risks to future growth appear tilted to the downside.” There’s also the turmoil in emerging markets, which is affecting sentiment more broadly.“While the U.S.-EU dispute has been contained, uncertainty stemming from the global unrest continues to weigh on European manufacturers,” said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING. “Large emerging trade partners are struggling with depreciated currencies, limiting European export potential.”"
417,"Sep 20, 2018 12:45PM ET",Peugeot urges France to revive incentives for hybrids,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumeSOCHAUX, France (Reuters) - PSA Group is pressing the French government to revive sales incentives on rechargeable hybrid vehicles as it rolls out plug-in versions of its larger models to meet tightening European emissions rules, the carmaker said on Thursday. Automakers are rushing to deploy electric cars and hybrids, which combine battery power with a combustion engine, to meet EU carbon dioxide limits and avoid hefty fines.""We’re asking for the reinstatement of incentives on plug-in hybrid vehicles,"" said Laurent Fabre, a governmental affairs executive for the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel vehicles. While PSA is well placed among carmakers to meet the goals, its pure-electric program will cover only the smallest cars - leaving its brands reliant on significant sales of rechargeable hybrids across the rest of their line-ups, from compacts such as the Peugeot 308 to the DS7 Crossback premium SUV. The collapse of fuel-efficient diesel sales has stiffened the challenge across the industry, causing CO2 emissions to begin rising again after years of improvement. While diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates than gasoline engines, their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases. France, by far PSA’s biggest market, currently offers a 6,000 euro ($7,000) subsidy on each electric car sold, but an earlier 1,000-euro plug-in hybrid incentive was scrapped last year. Financial support for low-emissions vehicle sales will be reviewed under draft 2019 budget proposals to be presented to ministers on Sept. 24. PSA’s French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) supports the call for the rechargeable hybrid incentive to be reinstated at 2,000 euros, Fabre said, adding the measure would cost taxpayers 40 million euros – based on expected sales of 20,000 vehicles.Plug-in hybrids, which avoid the range constraints of battery-only cars, offer the most reliable way to “kick-start the market” for electrified vehicles, Fabre said, adding the government was “attentive” to these considerations.A Renault spokeswoman said the carmaker had no immediate comment on the matter.Over the next two years PSA plans to launch eight new plug-in hybrid models, starting with the DS7 Crossback, and seven smaller pure-electric models.($1 = 0.8514 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

418,"Sep 19, 2018 06:55AM ET",TomTom says Google deal with carmakers could hit its orders: ANP,nan,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Digital mapping company TomTom will probably lose some business in future as a result of Google's deal with carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and Mitsubishi, TomTom's finance chief said on Wednesday.Carmakers opting for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps would have an impact on TomTom's order flow, CFO Taco Titulaer told Dutch news agency ANP, although that would not directly hit revenues immediately, as it takes time for orders to translate into sales. ""Our order inflow from automotive was worth around 400 million euros ($468 million) last year. Our revenues from automotive are around half that number this year,"" Titulaer said in an interview with ANP. Carmaking alliance Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced on Tuesday that they would use Google's Android operating system for dashboard entertainment and information systems in their vehicles, in a potential blow to TomTom, which supplies digital maps to Renault and other major car manufacturers.TomTom shares, which dived 24 percent on news of the deal on Tuesday, were down by a further 6.5 percent to 6.01 euros by 1015 GMT on Wednesday.""The announcement adds to the uncertainty of the long-term case for TomTom,"" ING analysts said in a note published on Wednesday. ""The key risk is that other clients could also move to Google in the future."" Titulaer would not give an indication of the impact of Google's deal on the future profitability of TomTom.The Dutch company, which made its name in the beginning of the 2000s with the introduction of popular personal navigation devices, is already facing shrinking sales as its market has faltered in recent years with the advent of smartphones.The company said in July that it expects sales to fall almost 10 percent this year to around 825 million euros, although it also forecast adjusted earnings would rise 15 percent to 0.30 euros per share this year, helped by cost cutting.($1 = 0.8551 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""As a result, double-digit percentage gains were registered in many EU countries.""The numbers published on Wednesday for the European Union and four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries reveal that France's Renault posted the steepest increase in regional sales, with a 56.4 percent gain. Its alliance partner Nissan's sales rose 46.3 percent.VW Group sales jumped 39.3 percent, while Fiat Chrysler registrations rose 38.9 percent, with sales by its Jeep brand leaping by 158 percent.Forecasters expect the market surge to be offset by a sales slowdown in the remaining months of the year, in which the August discounters are likely to come off worse.By contrast, Peugeot maker PSA Group and Japan's Toyota, which both had WTLP-compliant line-ups before the deadline, recorded August sales gains of 17-18 percent."
420,"Sep 18, 2018 08:23AM ET",Renault-Nissan adopts Android in coup for Google,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi carmaking alliance said on Tuesday it will adopt Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system, handing a victory to the U.S. tech giant as it pushes for a bigger share of the infotainment market. Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and Mitsubishi, with combined sales of 10.6 million vehicles last year, said future models will ""integrate Google applications and services"" including Maps and the voice-commanded Google Assistant.The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, leans more heavily on Big Tech than large or luxury rival carmakers have hitherto been willing to do. Many fear losing control of customer relationships, data and potentially significant future revenue from connected services.Some smaller manufacturers such as Volvo Cars [GEELY.UL] have decided to embed Android Auto in their vehicles. But the scale of the shift by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi may cause a broader rethink of costly standalone tech strategies.""Major carmakers earlier were reluctant to do business with Google, but this has now changed,"" said Jauke de Jong, a research analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam. ""More carmakers could follow suit and partner with Google.""Until now, carmakers have largely chosen Linux, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or QNX software to power infotainment. That yields clunkier platforms they can control, but which offer little scope to add new apps or functionality.CLOUT FOR KEYSThe news may spell trouble for certain existing auto-tech suppliers such as mapping specialist TomTom, which counts Renault among its customers. Shares in the Dutch group fell by more than quarter after the announcement.In return for handing Google the infotainment keys, the alliance will bring the full clout of Android's thousands of apps to its brands' lineups - which include a strong contingent of affordably priced, no-frills models for emerging markets.The partnership promises ""rich user experiences that are currently available only outside the vehicle or, to a limited extent, by connecting an Android device to supported vehicles,"" alliance development chief Hadi Zablit said. While many volume carmakers offer infotainment ""mirroring"" to pair with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones or Android smartphones, premium rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz are investing heavily in their own operating systems, vocal assistants and connected services.Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi said the new infotainment systems would also be integrated with remote vehicle diagnostics and over-the-air upgrade capabilities, offered via the alliance's own cloud-based service.After nearly two decades of partnership, Renault and Nissan are still integrating their own technologies, a process often fraught with tension. The choice of a third-party platform resolves questions of infotainment leadership neutrally.Renault owns a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn holds 15 percent of Renault and 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors.The first Android-equipped vehicles will launch in 2021, the alliance said, without disclosing any of the partnership's financial terms.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

421,"Sep 15, 2018 12:10PM ET",Hamilton storms to stunning pole in Singapore,nan,"By John O'BrienSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton tightened his grip on securing a fifth Formula One world title by coming from nowhere to claim a stunning pole position for the Singapore Grand Prix in his Mercedes on Saturday.The Briton, 30 points clear of closest rival Sebastian Vettel with seven rounds remaining, lapped the Marina Bay Street Circuit in 1:36.015 to claim a record-extending 79th pole position, 0.319 seconds ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.The Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) pairing of Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen had set the pace for most of the weekend but the German could manage only third place, more than half a second down, and will start alongside Mercedes's Valtteri Bottas.""That lap felt like magic. I don't really know where it came from,"" Hamilton said in an interview.""It was just perfectly to the limit. It felt like one of the best laps I can remember feeling,"" the Briton added, describing the 23-turn floodlit circuit as ""Monaco on steroids"".Hamilton's time was three-and-a-half seconds quicker than Vettel's pole position a year ago and should he make a clean start on a circuit where he has won three times before, the Briton is highly likely to extend his championship lead.Verstappen also sprang something of a surprise to finish just behind Hamilton, narrowly missing out on becoming the youngest ever pole-sitter in Formula One.The 20-year-old was delighted. ""Honestly, this feels like a victory. To be second is unbelievable,"" Verstappen said. ""We just have to make sure we have a clean start and then everything is possible.""TIRE GAMBLEVettel is also seeking a fifth world title and while he remains a huge threat in a very competitive car, the German was disappointed not to have been able to capitalize on the dominance Ferrari had over their rivals in practice.""For us it was a bit of a messy qualifying,"" he said. ""We had two laps (in the final qualifying session) and they were both not good enough.""Raikkonen ended in fifth place, almost eight tenths of a second behind Hamilton, the Finn lining up next to Daniel Ricciardo in the other Red Bull. Ricciardo was the only other driver to lap the 5.063 km track in lower than 1:37.000.Force India's Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon will start seventh and ninth respectively, while Romain Grosjean is eighth on the grid for Haas with Nico Hulkenberg rounding out the top 10 in his  Renault  (PA:RENA).Hamilton admitted that Mercedes had been too conservative in their tire choices for the race and after sneaking through the first phase of qualifying on the slower ultrasoft tires, the Briton was unstoppable with the high-grip hypersofts on his car.""I didn't have a wheelspin, I didn't have a snap anywhere, the car was just underneath me and I managed to maximize every corner... and I do feel like I got absolutely everything possible on that lap,"" Hamilton added. Ferrari also gambled in the second phase of qualifying by using the more durable ultrasofts, which they would start on in Sunday's race, but the team aborted the plan when it was fairly obvious they would not advance to Q3.""The race is a different story and things will not be the same tomorrow but we are, for sure, not happy with how it went today,"" a despondent Vettel said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

426,"Sep 06, 2018 10:40AM ET",Young drivers pose a triple headache for Mercedes F1 boss,nan,"By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - Formula One world champions Mercedes may have to rethink their junior program if young drivers like Frenchman Esteban Ocon are unable to find a race seat, according to team boss Toto Wolff.The sport's annual game of driver musical chairs is in full swing but Mercedes have a problem, with three of their highly-rated proteges still looking for a place and not enough available.Ocon, a 21-year-old rising star at Force India, Britain's Formula Two championship leader George Russell and Germany's Pascal Wehrlein are all drivers Mercedes want to see in Formula One but who have nothing guaranteed.""As it stands (we have) three really talented kids with the lack of opportunity,"" Wolff told reporters in Italy at the weekend.""And this has come to a point now where we need to decide what we want to do in the future.""Mercedes' problem is that most of the remaining vacancies are at teams who are either linked to rival manufacturers or, like Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso, have young driver programs of their own and promote from within.They have little interest in drivers that Mercedes want to place but keep on long-term contracts.Of the three Mercedes-powered teams, former champions Williams will need a replacement for Lance Stroll who looks sure to take Ocon's place at Force India -- a team now controlled by the Canadian's billionaire father.Williams are last in the championship and facing a big hit on sponsorship and prize money, however, and that means commercial considerations are likely to come into play.Mercedes could offer a discount on the engines to sweeten a deal but none of their juniors would bring the sort of funding that others might muster.Wehrlein, 23, has raced for now-defunct Manor and then Ferrari-powered Sauber but lost his seat at the end of the 2017 season. While Mercedes found him a seat in the DTM German Touring Car championship, they are pulling out of that series at the end of the year to focus on Formula E.Ocon was set to join  Renault  (PA:RENA), but Australian Daniel Ricciardo scuppered that move by deciding to leave Red Bull, and McLaren this week closed another door by taking 18-year-old Briton Lando Norris. Russell, 20, will leave Formula Two if he wins the championship.Wolff said funding a junior team was not an option for cost reasons and the current model of support was backfiring if young Mercedes drivers ended up being 'stigmatized' by other teams.""If we can’t find a solution for these guys, I question the junior program in the future,"" said Wolff, whose factory team has four-times world champion Lewis Hamilton and Finland's Valtteri Bottas confirmed for 2019.The Austrian suggested a solution would be for teams to field a third car specifically for youngsters for a maximum two years per driver.""The costs wouldn’t be huge, the grid would be packed and we would have fantastic shows of new kids on the block coming up and fighting hard with the Valtteris and Lewises of this world and maybe surprising us,"" he said.""But owning another team just to have a place for your young drivers doesn’t make sense.""The idea of three-car teams is not new and has been resisted in the past by smaller and poorer constructors who fear being further disadvantaged and squeezed out of the points paying positions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It's incredible the safety of the cars these days,"" said Ericsson in a video message on Twitter. ""I feel fine and hopefully we can be back tomorrow and fighting."" Vettel spun off at Parabolica later but without significant damage. He kept the engine running and returned to the pits before resuming.Heavy rain just before the morning practice saw neither of the title contenders do many laps, with Force India's Sergio Perez leading through the spray with a best effort of 1:34.000.That marked the first time this season that one of the Mercedes, Ferrari or Red Bull drivers had not led the practice timesheets.The Mexican, whose team were rescued from administration this month and given a new lease of life as a new mid-season entry owned by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, was eighth in the afternoon as normal service was resumed in dry conditions.Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who is using an upgraded  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine, was fifth and sixth but is set to take penalties that will send him towards the back of the field on Sunday.Dutch team mate Max Verstappen was fifth and faster in the afternoon with the older specification engine.McLaren reserve driver Lando Norris had his second Friday practice outing, after Belgium, in the morning but clocked the slowest time after running when the rain was heavy.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I'm, like, 'I don't know if you guys saw, but...""Ricciardo is joining  Renault  (PA:RENA) next season in a move that dropped like a bombshell in Formula One just before the August break.Before that, he had been linked in media speculation to glamour team Ferrari and champions Mercedes but neither expressed any interest in pairing him with their title contenders.Sebastian Vettel has a contract with Ferrari to the end of 2020 while fellow four times world champion Lewis Hamilton recently renewed his deal at Mercedes.""I feel like if the fans voted, things would probably be different,"" said the Australian.""I guess they (the Italian Ferrari fans) still want some of my Italian blood in one of their Italian cars. But they're cool. They're full on but in a friendly way.""Ricciardo, who said he arrived in Monza a day early just because he wanted pizza, started 16th in Monza last season due to engine penalties and finished fourth. He had qualified in third place.This time he will have more penalties with Red Bull eager to take up the latest Renault upgrades and wanting to avoid any grid drop at the next race in Singapore where they have a chance of winning.""Its likely I'll have another one at some point,"" said Ricciardo. ""If we could get from Singapore through without any penalties then that would be above target for now.""Renault's Nico Hulkenberg has a 10-place drop imposed after he caused a crash at last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, which means Ricciardo might not be right at the back on Sunday. Despite that, he was still hoping to make the podium.""The podium looks so good here. I'm hoping for some crazy race that gets me on the podium,"" he said.""I did Eau Rouge (at Spa) without a rear wing on lap one (after a collision) so I think we're just going to take the rear wing off (here),"" he joked.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

There were some concerns on Sunday, then Monday and Tuesday they checked everything properly and it seems OK,"" he told reporters on Thursday.""So hopefully we can run still with that engine,"" said the double world champion.Of more concern was a shortage of the latest specification parts, with Italy following immediately on from Belgium.""The full car -- not only the chassis -- the floor, the front wings, the things that we are limited on parts they are gone. It (the crash) was quite expensive,"" he said.""Probably we will run out of spare parts. We have just what we have on the car.

And then you have four days only to build a completely new car for Monza.""Alonso's Belgian team mate Stoffel Vandoorne replaced engine parts, with consequent penalties, at Spa while the Spaniard did not in the hope of a points finish.Instead, the crash ended his race at the first corner and he will still face engine changes and grid penalties down the road.""It's a double zero; one in Spa because of another guy, and another one that you will take the penalties. So quite a sad day,"" said the 37-year-old ahead of what will be his last Italian Grand Prix.Alonso, the only driver on the current grid to have won at Monza for Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), has announced his departure at the end of the season.He said the pain of the crash, which had left him with a sore wrist and back, had subsided.""The only painful day was Tuesday,"" he added. ""On Tuesday when I woke up I felt a little bit sore in the back. ""I'm still feeling some kind of heat (in the wrist), because I had the hands on the steering wheel when I touched Leclerc.

""Monza was a good one.""So I am very curious to see how it's going to go in Monza. Last year we were very much in control of the whole weekend and Ferrari had their worst weekend of the season, performance-wise. I'm not worried.""Red Bull will be looking more to Singapore, the race after, with Australian Daniel Ricciardo set to take a  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine upgrade that will incur engine penalties and leave him starting at the back.Dutch team mate Max Verstappen, third in Belgium, will be the main spoiler hoping to get amongst the Ferrari and Mercedes drivers to stir things up.Force India will also be hoping for another strong performance after Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon finished fifth and sixth at Spa in the team's first race under their new ownership. Lance Stroll, the 19-year-old Canadian whose father leads the consortium that now owns Force India, started on the front row for Williams last year but there is no chance of a repeat of that feat this time.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

433,"Aug 28, 2018 09:20AM ET",Exclusive: France restricts travel by diplomats to Iran,nan,"By John IrishPARIS (Reuters) - France has told its diplomats and foreign ministry officials to postpone indefinitely all non-essential travel to Iran, citing a foiled bomb plot and a hardening of Tehran's attitude towards France, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.Any hardening of relations with France could have wider implications for Iran. France has been one of the strongest advocates of salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May.Iran's economy has been hammered by the prospect of the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. European countries including France have pledged to try to soften the economic blow, but have been unable so far to persuade their firms to defy Washington and stay in Iran.French oil and gas major Total and its carmakers PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have led an exodus of European companies from Iran, fearful of the extra-territorial reach of Washington's sanctions.The memo cites a foiled plot to bomb a rally held by an exiled Iranian opposition group near Paris that was attended by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Tehran's more aggressive stance towards France. ""The behavior of the Iranian authorities suggests a hardening of their position vis-a-vis our country, as well as some of our allies,"" Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, the ministry's secretary general wrote in the notice dated Aug. 20.     ""Given the known security risks ... all departmental officers, whether from headquarters or (overseas) posts, are required to defer until further notice, except for urgent work, any travel plans in Iran,"" Gourdault-Montagne added.The instructions were also relayed to officials in government departments outside the foreign ministry to be passed on to staff who intended to travel to Iran, a separate memo obtained by Reuters showed. The French foreign ministry declined to comment on the memo or say whether embassy staff had been asked to repatriate their families. Iranian officials at the Embassy in Paris did not respond to a request for comment. France's latest travel advisory for its citizens, published on May 10, cautions against visitors entering Iran with electronic equipment such as drones and walkie-talkies and taking too many photographs.RELATIONS SOURThe memo underscores how confidence in the Tehran government has been eroded in Paris as relations between the two become increasingly strained, even as President Emmanuel Macron talks up preserving the nuclear accord.Iran has said it had nothing to do with the alleged plot to attack a National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) meeting on June 30. Germany has detained an Iranian diplomat based in Austria. Belgium, where the plot was uncovered, has sought the diplomat's extradition.French officials have not commented on the matter but diplomatic sources have said privately that if Iran's involvement were proven then it would be difficult for France not to react strongly.Since pulling out of the nuclear accord, Trump has expressed a readiness to negotiate a new deal while warning Tehran of dire consequences ""the like of which few throughout history have suffered before"" if it made threats against the United States.It was Macron who led efforts to persuade Trump to stick with the agreement, arguing it was the best means Western powers had to check Iran's nuclear activities.Rouhani on Monday urged the remaining signatories to the nuclear agreement to act to save the pact.Macron reiterated France's commitment to maintaining the accord, but Europe's leaders have appeared powerless to prevent the U.S. sanctions inflicting pain on Iran's economy.The ministry memo said any staffer who traveled to Iran for personal reasons would not be shielded by diplomatic immunity, even if holding a diplomatic passport. It made specific reference to tourism and language classes.Britain's foreign ministry said its advice on Iran to diplomats was the same as to the British public. It flags the risks of terrorist attacks and arbitrary detentions and advises against all travel to the frontiers with Iraq and Afghanistan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It should be accelerated,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said. ""Iran relies mainly on its own capabilities to overcome America's new sanctions,"" he told a news conference broadcast on state TV.European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal, which Trump said was ""deeply flawed"". Washington imposed new sanctions on Iran in August, targeting its trade in gold and other precious metals, purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry.The European powers, China and Russia say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with Iran. But the threat of the U.S. sanctions has prompted many major companies to pull out of Iran.Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said France's Total (PA:TOTF) has formally left a contract to develop Iran's South Pars Gas project. ""The process to replace (Total) with another company is underway,"" he was quoted as saying by state TV.Total, which signed the deal in 2017 with an initial investment of $1 billion, did not have any immediate comment.Iranian officials had earlier suggested that China’s state-owned CNPC could take over Total’s stake in the offshore project. CNPC, which already has a 30 percent stake in the deal, is an experienced onshore oil and gas producer, but is relatively new to offshore drilling. WARY INVESTORSMost of CNPC's experience lies in its subsidiary China Petroleum Offshore Engineering Company (CPOE), which has worked in shallow waters off north China.""Once Total quits, that will trigger CNPC to take over automatically, according to the contract,” a senior Chinese industry source with knowledge of the deal told Reuters.“But the question is not about if CNPC is going to take over as the operator, but if CNPC could deliver and advance the project without Total.”China also faces challenges supplying equipment such as large-scale compressors needed for developing the giant gas project, as leading manufacturers could be barred from supplying to Iran under U.S. sanctions.Carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are also among those to suspend or drop plans to invest in Iran along with Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE)Working to maintain financial channels with Tehran and facilitate Iran's oil exports, the European Union has taken steps to counter the renewed U.S. sanctions, including forbidding EU citizens from complying with them or related court rulings.Washington has said Iran’s only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept Trump’s offer to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal. Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected the offer.""We do not want to revisit that nuclear deal. We want the United States to implement that (2015) nuclear deal"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN on Sunday.The United States will impose tougher sanctions in November which will target Iran's oil sales and banking sector. Iran's rial currency has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions.Under the 2015 deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on the country's nuclear program.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Our goal is a global trade order with lower tariffs, less protectionism and open markets,"" Altmaier said.Turning to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the minister said Germany and its EU allies would continue to support companies doing business with Iran despite U.S. pressure.""We won't let Washington dictate us with whom we can do business and we therefore stick to the Vienna Nuclear Agreement so that Iran cannot build atomic weapons,"" Altmaier said.German companies should be allowed to continue to invest in Iran as much as they want and the German government is looking for ways together with its European allies to ensure that financial transactions could still take place, he added.Several European companies have suspended plans to invest in Iran in light of the U.S. sanctions, including oil major  Total  (PA:TOTF) as well as carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn).

444,"Aug 07, 2018 10:04AM ET",New Trump sanctions on Iran take effect despite pleas from allies,nan,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh and Peter GraffBEIRUT/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday that firms doing business with Tehran would be barred from the United States, as new U.S. sanctions against Iran took effect in spite of pleas from Washington's allies.Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program.Trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington's main European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.The European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of U.S. sanctions and persuade their firms not to pull out. But that has proven difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business.""These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Monday Iran's only chance of escaping sanctions would be to take up an offer to negotiate with Trump for a tougher deal.""They could take up the president's offer to negotiate with them, to give up their ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs fully and really verifiably,"" Bolton told Fox News.""If the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze, they should come and sit down. The pressure will not relent while the negotiations go on,"" said Bolton, one of the administration's main hawks on Iran.REMOVE THE KNIFEWashington accepts that Iran has complied with the terms of the 2015 deal reached under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, but says the agreement is flawed because it is not strenuous enough. Iran says it will continue to abide by the deal for now, if other countries can help protect it from the economic impact of Washington's decision to pull out.Tuesday's sanctions target Iran's purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and auto sector. Global oil prices rose on Tuesday on concern sanctions could cut world supply, although the toughest measures targeting Iran's oil exports do not take effect for four more months.Brent crude oil futures were up 75 cents to $74.50 per barrel at 1337 GMT and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 32 cents at $69.33 a barrel.""It is a reality check that this is happening and that Iran's oil exports will be hurt when the oil sanctions hit it in November,"" chief commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) Bjarne Schieldrop said.In a speech hours before the sanctions were due to take effect, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani rejected negotiations as long as Washington was no longer complying with the deal.""If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,"" Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.""We are always in favor of diplomacy and talks...But talks need honesty,"" Rouhani said.The nuclear deal is closely associated in Iran with Rouhani, a relative moderate who won two landslide elections on promises to open up the economy to the outside world.European countries fear that by abandoning the deal, Washington risks undermining Rouhani and strengthening the hand of his more hardline opponents, who have long argued that the West would never allow Iran to prosper.Britain, France, Germany and the EU as a bloc said in a joint statement on Monday: ""We deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S.""Since the sanctions were initially lifted two years ago, Iranian oil exports have risen. But many Iranians have yet to see major economic improvement, and the prospect that Washington would re-impose sanctions helped drive a collapse in the value of Iran's currency this year, raising the cost of imports.There have been protests in Iran this year against rising prices, and the security forces have responded firmly. Perhaps seeking to head off more unrest, Iran announced steps this week to make it easier to access foreign currency, and said it was prosecuting an ex-central bank official for economic crimes.""[Sanctions] will definitely make daily life harder for Iranians,"" said Saeed Leylaz, a Tehran-based economist and political analyst. ""But if the government has a serious plan they can control the situation.""Few American companies do much business in Iran, an enemy of the United States since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington's ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there.Among large European companies that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France's oil major Total and its big carmakers PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA).""We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions"", said German car and truck manufacturer Daimler.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That big decision will also affect the futures of struggling Belgian team mate Stoffel Vandoorne and up-and-coming British reserve Lando Norris.Toro Rosso expressed an interest in Norris when a replacement for Hartley was mooted earlier in the season but McLaren did not play ball.Whether that might change if there is no 2019 seat at Woking available remains to be seen.KNOCK-ON EFFECTRenault's surprise signing of Ricciardo, which came as almost everyone in Formula One assumed his staying at Red Bull was a done deal, also has a knock-on effect on the plans of Mercedes, Force India and Williams.Force India are in administration with their future uncertain.It had been widely assumed that the team's Mercedes-backed French driver Esteban Ocon was bound for Renault.The speculation was that Canadian Lance Stroll was in turn poised to switch from Williams, bringing also some sort of investment from his billionaire father.The vacancy at Williams could then have gone to another Mercedes protege and Formula Two leader George Russell, whose route now looks less certain -- unless Force India's Mexican driver Sergio Perez also moves.There could also be openings at U.S.-owned Haas, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean having an erratic and costly season, and at Sauber where Monegasque rookie Charles Leclerc is tipped to replace Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari (NYSE:RACE).The Finn could then become another player in the game of musical chairs.Once that is all decided only time will tell whether Ricciardo has made the right move, as four-times world champion Lewis Hamilton did at the end of 2012 when he left McLaren for as-yet unsuccessful Mercedes.Formula One has plenty to contemplate and speculate about as the August break starts and the 'silly season' shows no sign of abating.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Tamil Nadu government has since paid some money and now owes Nissan about 20 billion rupees in unpaid incentives, one of the sources said.According to the proposal the two sides are close to agreement on, the state would pay the automaker 3 billion rupees upfront once the deal was signed, with the remainder paid by the end of 2019 in 10 installments, the sources said.Nissan would drop the arbitration case against India once the settlement was agreed, the sources said.The proposal has been drawn up by state government officials and Nissan India executives and needs to be approved by Tamil Nadu's chief minister and the carmaker's executives in Japan before it is finalised, one of the sources said.M. C. Sampath, Tamil Nadu's industries minister, confirmed the state was in advanced talks with Nissan. ""A final decision on this matter will be taken soon, there is a conducive environment that prevails between the two parties now,"" he said, without commenting on the detail of the proposal.""Nissan continues to work with the government to resolve this matter,"" a company spokesman said in a statement, without commenting on the detail of the proposal. The Prime Minister's Office also did not respond to a request for comment.""DETROIT OF SOUTH ASIA""Nissan, which has less than a 2 percent share of India's passenger vehicle market, builds and sells the Micra hatchback, Sunny sedan and Terrano sport-utility vehicle in the country. It also sells budget cars under its Datsun brand. In 2008, when the Japanese carmaker and its French global alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) agreed to invest in a car plant in Chennai, the state government promised several incentives, including some tax refunds.Over seven years, Nissan and Renault spent 61 billion rupees setting up a plant with an annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles, which entitled them to receive the incentives in 2015, according to the legal notice.Several other automakers, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), have production hubs in Tamil Nadu, giving state capital Chennai the nickname the ""Detroit of South Asia"".The Nissan case, covered by a bilateral trade and investment agreement between New Delhi and Tokyo, is one of more than 20 international arbitration proceedings brought by investors against India, among the highest against any single nation.Companies including  Vodafone  Group (L:VOD),  Cairn Energy  (L:CNE) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) have initiated arbitration seeking to protect their investments against retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts.India last year canceled investment treaties with about 50 foreign governments, making it harder for investors to seek international arbitration for disputes, sources have told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

[nL4N1UO069]Perez told reporters at the weekend that he had acted to save the team, and 400 jobs, from the threat of being closed down in the face of a winding-up order scheduled for the London High Court last Wednesday.Fernley suggested that was not an entirely accurate representation of what had happened.""I know absolutely categorically that Vijay had some very sensible solutions to everything to be able to maintain the team going forward. This process obviously affected those,"" he said.""I don't have enough information to tell you,"" he added when asked whether he felt there had been an orchestrated coup to remove Mallya.""All I know is that from our point of view it was an unexpected move. And Vijay certainly wasn't expecting it,"" said Fernley.INTERESTED SPECTATORSThe Briton said the winding-up order had been brought by the British tax authorities but was not as critical as had been made out.""The winding-up order that was due to be heard, HMRC were dismissing that because all the money had been paid,"" he said, while acknowledging that it would only have been a deferral with another creditor ready to step in.Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said there were five interested parties who could now take over the team but it would be for the administrators to decide which was the best long-term prospect.""We as Mercedes are interested spectators of the process,"" he told reporters.""We would like to understand what the funding strategy going forward from a potential new buyer is, how it could affect the collaboration between the two teams. We aren't there yet.""As well as providing the engines to the team, Perez's French team mate Esteban Ocon is also backed by the German manufacturer. He is tipped for a move to  Renault  (PA:RENA) while Perez's future remains uncertain.Force India's problems are well-documented, with Mallya having assets frozen in India and fighting an attempt to extradite him from Britain to face charges of fraud, which he denies. A group of Indian banks are seeking to recover more than $1 billion of loans granted to his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines.Mallya has decried a ""political witchhunt"" and has said he is seeking to sell assets worth about 139 billion Indian rupees ($2.02 billion) to repay creditors.($1 = 68.6550 Indian rupees)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I'm really happy, going into the break, particularly with back-to-back wins.""I think that boost will last a long time for our team and it’s encouraging for everyone so I’m excited for the break,"" added the Briton.Vettel took the chequered flag 17.1 seconds behind, after surviving a late collision with Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas who also banged bodywork with Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo.Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), mourning the death of former chairman Sergio Marchionne, had Kimi Raikkonen finish third to complete a podium of champions on a dry and sweltering afternoon at the Hungaroring outside Budapest.The victory was Hamilton's record sixth in Hungary and 67th of his career.In a race effectively decided by Saturday's wet qualifying, when Mercedes locked out the front row of the grid against expectation, Hamilton was never challenged.""We came here knowing Ferrari would be really quick this weekend so to come out with these points, we'll definitely take it as a bonus,"" said Hamilton in a pitlane interview after embracing team members.""I'm really happy with how strong it's come in the last couple of races. We've got to come strong in the next half,"" added the 33-year-old, who won in Germany from 14th place on the grid a weekend earlier.Tyre strategies were also crucial at a relatively slow and twisty circuit where overtaking is always difficult, with track temperatures hovering around 50 degrees Celsius.Vettel started on the softs and went for a longer first stint than Mercedes, worried by Ferrari's quick getaways, who opted for ultrasofts that were quicker at the start but faded more rapidly.Lining up in fourth place on the grid, Vettel grabbed third from Raikkonen immediately but could not find a way past Bottas who slotted in behind Hamilton as a defense against the red threat.""We were out of position. I think we could have gone with Lewis today with the race pace,"" said Vettel.""P2 is not really what we wanted this weekend but I think it was the maximum today.""ANGRY VERSTAPPEN Raikkonen, without water during the race after Ferrari forgot to connect the bottle, made two stops and agreed third - his fifth successive podium finish - was the best he could have hoped for in the circumstances.""We caught up with Bottas after the first stop but there was no chance to overtake. So our option was to stop again and try again. At least we got one place back but far from ideal,"" said the Finn.""I think we had pretty good speed today. But what can you do? Sometimes it's like that, but you take the points and go on to the next one.""Ricciardo, starting 12th, finished fourth but his Dutch team mate Max Verstappen retired early on with a  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine failure that infuriated both driver and team boss Christian Horner.""We pay multi-millions of pounds for these engines and for first class, or state-of-the-art, product and you can see it's quite clearly some way below that,"" said Horner.Bottas ended up fifth, and was handed a 10 second post-race penalty for the Ricciardo collision, with French driver Pierre Gasly sixth for Toro Rosso.Kevin Magnussen was a lapped seventh for Haas, lifting the U.S.-owned team to fifth and ahead of Force India, with double world champion Fernando Alonso eighth for McLaren on his 37th birthday.Carlos Sainz took two points for Renault in ninth and Romain Grosjean made sure of another for Haas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I suppose no surprise really,"" he added.""I'm not going to get drawn into saying too much. We pay multi-millions of pounds for these engines and for first class, or state-of-the-art, product and you can see it's quite clearly some way below that.""Horner said he would let Renault F1 managing director Cyril Abiteboul ""come up with the excuses afterwards.""Red Bull are ditching Renault at the end of the season and switching to Honda from 2019.Renault powered the former champions to drivers' and constructor's titles for four years in a row between 2010 and 2013 but the relationship frayed in the current V6 turbo hybrid era. Red Bull had fancied their chances in Hungary before the weekend but rain in qualifying dented their hopes, with 20-year-old Verstappen starting seventh and Australian Daniel Ricciardo back in 12th.Ricciardo, race winner in Monaco, took grid penalties in Germany last weekend -- starting at the rear of the field -- to give himself the best chance in Hungary but retired from that race due to a power unit problem.It subsequently emerged that the Australian had been unable to take all the new components Red Bull had wanted because Renault made only three of the six items available. The normal strategy would have been to change everything.""Engine failure can happen at any time, even with a new engine, unfortunately, it can happen, as happened in the past,"" Abiteboul told motorsport.com after that race at Hockenheim.Verstappen, the youngest ever race winner in Formula One history, has an army of Dutch fans with thousands traveling to Budapest to cheer him on.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Citic Dicastal aims to produce 6 million units annually, most of which will be exported, the ministry said.Investment incentives in industrial free zones and proximity to Europe as well as African markets are luring car component makers to invest in Morocco. French car makers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  PSA (PA:PEUP) set up factories in Tangier and Kenitra respectively.The government plans to bring the local sourcing rate of cars made in Morocco to 80 percent by 2020.""Through this project, Dicastal expands its international investments and contributes to Morocco's industrial development and Moroccan-Chinese trade,"" Chairman of Citic Dicastal Xu Zuo said at the signing ceremony.Last April, South Korea's Hands Corp (KS:143210) began building an aluminum wheel plant in Tangier at a total cost of 4.33 billion dirhams ($472 million), with an annual production capacity of 8 million units.The automotive sector was the country's largest industrial exporting sector last year, with exports worth 70 billion dirhams. Up to June of this year, the sector led Morocco's exports with a rise of 19.1 percent to 35.973 billion dirhams compared to the same period a year earlier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I didn't make any mistakes.""It was the 66th win of his F1 career, and Mercedes' 80th, and minutes after the finish, the skies opened with an array of thunder and lightning and a torrential downpour that would have stopped any race. ""Miracles do happen, mate,"" Hamilton's race engineer Pete Bonnington told him over the radio after a slow-burner that turned into one of the great comebacks of the Briton's already stellar career.Hamilton, who threw himself across the pitlane wall into the arms of his mechanics and also got a bear-hug from delighted Mercedes-Benz boss Dieter Zetsche, seemed about as stunned as anyone.""I really feel that the rain has come down and just washed away any negativity and its a glorious day,"" Hamilton said, his voice wobbling. ""It couldn't have been a better day for me and one that I will always remember."" FERRARI NIGHTMARE Beaten by Vettel in his home British Grand Prix at Silverstone two weeks ago, where he went from pole to the back of the field and up to second, he had turned the tables completely.""Love conquers all,"" declared Hamilton, who had reacted defiantly on Instagram to the booing and hostility from a partisan crowd after his car broke down in Saturday's qualifying.""It's obviously very, very difficult from that position and highly unlikely but you've always got to believe,"" added the four-times champion, who said a long prayer before the race started.""I really manifested my dream today.""For Vettel, it was simply a nightmare -- the chance to make big gains slipping through his hands in an instant. He now has 171 points to Hamilton's 188.He pummeled the steering wheel angrily after the car crumpled against the tyre wall, the lap 52 incident bringing out the safety car.""I had it in my hands -- small mistake, big disappointment,"" said the German.""It was just one of those moments. It was my mistake so apologies to the team. They did everything right.""Hamilton, who was already up to fifth after 14 laps, had made his first set of soft tyres last for 42 laps but pitted before the rain came and went to ultrasofts.He still had to defend from an attacking Bottas, with the two going wheel to wheel when the safety car came in before they received orders to hold position. It was the Finn's fifth second place in 11 races.Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) had also earlier applied team orders of their own, telling Raikkonen to move over for Vettel when the German found himself behind the Finn after the pitstops. Max Verstappen was fourth for Red Bull, but his Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo retired with an engine failure after rising from the back of the field to sixth.German driver Nico Hulkenberg was fifth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), with Romain Grosjean sixth for Haas ahead of Mexican Sergio Perez and Frenchman Esteban Ocon for Force India in seventh and eighth positions.Sweden's Marcus Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) put Sauber in the points with ninth and New Zealander Brendon Hartley was 10th for Toro Rosso -- only his second scoring finish.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We as a team are trying to find the problem and have both cars in the same condition and performance,"" he said.""He’s OK and will be very close in performance as soon as the car is delivering the normal performance. You just need to see the results before Silverstone or last year in terms of qualifying.""I think it’s difficult to beat me,"" added the Spaniard with a smile. ""If you see previous team mates they were a lot further than Stoffel. In 2014 it was six or seven tenths to Kimi (Raikkonen) in every race. It’s less than that now.""Alonso and Raikkonen were team mates at Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), when the Finn was around half a second slower than the Spaniard in 2014 and was out-qualified in 16 of 19 races. Vandoorne's average is around 0.3 of a second.The Belgian's place at McLaren next season remains uncertain, with British reserve Lando Norris being groomed for promotion but Spaniard Carlos Sainz has also been linked to the team.Sainz is currently on loan from Red Bull to Renault, whose engines power McLaren.The word in the Hockenheim paddock was that Mercedes-backed Frenchman Esteban Ocon is heading for Renault from Force India with Sainz moving on to McLaren as replacement either for Vandoorne or Alonso, if the Spaniard decides to leave.McLaren principal Zak Brown said having two Spanish drivers could have commercial benefits.""For sponsors, what's interesting is having the two best drivers available, whatever country they are from. Carlos Sainz is a very good race driver,"" he told reporters.Vandoorne said the team had seen some differences on the data between his car and Alonso's.""It’s just a lack of general grip.

454,"Jul 20, 2018 12:00PM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/CHINESE BURNThe world is increasingly uneasy about Beijing's next moves to support its economy and temper damage from higher U.S. tariffs. The yuan is at a one year-low -- state-run banks finally stepped in to its support but clearly, authorities are prepared to tolerate a weaker currency which helps exporters.It could prove tricky, however, to keep conditions supportive while preventing big capital outflows that put the skids on the yuan. Sharp yuan depreciation poses problems for Chinese firms with dollar debt and hurt overall confidence in markets. Also, too much currency weakening will draw the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump who has already complained about the yuan ""dropping like a rock"".Benchmark rate cuts are therefore unlikely. Instead, policymakers are tinkering with liquidity, including initiatives such as incentivising commercial banks to lend to small business. And after cutting banks' reserve ratios in March and June, they may cut again, potentially in September.The rest of emerging Asia is also concerned -- a lurch lower by the yuan will mean currencies from the Philippines to India, already at multi-year lows, will have to play catch up.China boosts liquidity, set for more policy easing as trade war threatens economyChina to use 'counter-cyclical' measures to curb FX volatilityChina sets yuan midpoint at weakest in a year2/LET'S TWIST AGAINThe ECB gathers on Thursday and after the excitement generated at its last meeting by its pledge to keep interest rates unchanged ""at least through the summer"" of 2019, this will be of great interest to those looking for further guidance.Some ECB policymakers apparently still want a June 2019 rate rise, while others see trade tensions as a reason to stay loose for longer. But given that ECB President Mario Draghi made it clear the bank had left language ""intentionally vague"", he is unlikely to be any more forthcoming on the timing.But there are other issues to quiz him on. One is on how the central bank plans to deploy redemptions from its outstanding bond holdings once its asset purchase scheme expires at the end of 2018. Reports suggest it will use reinvestments to buy long-dated bonds, thus magnifying the stimulus effect.Yield curves have already flattened in anticipation, giving borrowers the opportunity to issue more long-dated bonds and lock in low borrowing costs for decades to come. Belgium plans to sell 50-year bonds next week and others could follow.What of the economy? There are signs momentum is stabilising after a sudden slowdown earlier this year. Flash euro zone PMI data due on Tuesday should give some indication of how the economy is coping with global trade conflicts, Italian politics and messy Brexit negotiations.ECB policymakers split on meaning of `through summer', and on timing of rate hikeECB mulls small ""Twist"" to keep borrowing costs low -sourcesEuro members consider more super-long borrowing as ECB mulls bond 'twist'3/ENEMY AT THE RATESThe central banks of Turkey, Chile, Nigeria, Hungary, Argentina, Colombia and Russia all meet to set interest rates; the leaders of the BRIC nations meet in Johannesburg; and G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Buenos Aires. In short, it's a big week for emerging markets. As it seems to be every week right now, with the strength of the dollar, rising U.S. interest rates and escalating trade war tensions tightening the squeeze. Emerging stocks, bonds and currencies are falling and investors are pulling cash out of EM funds.EM central banks are in a bind. Do they cut rates to support growth and domestic asset prices, which would fuel inflationary pressures? Or do they raise rates to track the Fed, fight inflation and support their currencies even though that could choke growth? We'll find out next week on which side of that fence many of them sit, while the commentary out of Buenos Aires and Johannesburg could also be market-moving.*WRAPUP 1-China markets gyrate as yuan hits one-year lows*Emerging market volatility fuelling currency trading boom4/SCINTILLATING STUFFEconomists polled by Reuters reckon U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) expanded a scintillating 4 percent in the April-June quarter, or double the first quarter's output. The data is due on Friday. <USGDPA=ECI>.One of the main drivers of the robust expansion was, possibly, a rush by U.S. exporters to get their products to markets before tariffs and counter-tariffs kicked in and full-fledged trade war broke out.U.S. farmers probably stuffed the export channel (think soybeans to China) before the tariffs. But while that probably contributed to overall growth, economists warn the spike higher in GDP, either from net exports or increased business spending (see defense, or oil drilling) may not last. So even if Q2 growth turns out to be a barn-burner, it is likely to back off in the second half of the year as tariffs bite harder and both imports and exports ease.Not a flagging U.S. economy then, but one that might sag from here.U.S., euro zone growth readings to tell story of divergence Manufacturing, mining power U.S. industrial production5/POOR DRIVING CONDITIONSSecond quarter results stream in next week from big European carmakers Peugeot, Fiat, Daimler and  Renault  (PA:RENA). Shares in the sector, under immense pressure from the threat of higher U.S. import levies, are down almost 10 percent this year, and the results could give the selloff extra mileage should companies downgrade earnings outlooks.Autos are likely to be high on the agenda for trade talks between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and U.S. President Donald Trump next Wednesday too, after the industry blasted tariff plans in a U.S. Department of Commerce hearing.But many investors are simply looking for some clarity.

The VeChain Foundation participated in a closed funding round for the project, thus becoming both a technical and a financial backer. The Cahrenheit project aims to provide a decentralized searchable store of information for clients and enterprises, to achieve the free flow of information in the car industry.“I am extremely excited to be working with Cahrenheit to further develop VeChain’s already strong presence within the automotive industry though its partnership with BMW and  Renault  (PA:RENA),” said the founder and CEO of VeChain, Sunny Lu.However, the recent successful new blockchain launch and the release of a mobile wallet did little to stem the sudden drop in VEN prices. Just as VEN rose against the market in past months, recently, the coin lost its backers. Despite the strong community, when it comes to trading, volumes have dwindled.Some see the price of VEN as going through a freefall, possibly dropping much lower before any signs of recovery. VEN continued to slide ahead of the weekend, falling to as low as $1.61 on Friday in a continued unraveling in the past week. The prices below $2 caused panic and expanded the selling.!veChain!One possible explanation for the slide in VeChain prices was that after July 1, the requirement to hold onto 6,000 VEN to qualify for X Node Status was removed. So, owners of X Node status were satisfied that their node status was secured, and went on to trade their assets.The question remains how many X Node holders would buy back the VEN coins in order to start staking them and receive rewards.The other reason for the selling is that the token swap had a rather long deadline, and the new blockchain, launched on July 1, is not handling transactions or giving rewards. Users have observed that there are no new tokens to run on that network. Analyst Jackson Rockwood further mentioned in his recent blog that those who expected immediate staking and rewards were disappointed, leading to selling.Until recently, the VEN market price was supported precisely because a large section of the token supply was locked away. Still, VEN is seen as one of the potentially growing projects, which could lead to a price increase in the longer run.Neither the author nor the publication takes any responsibility or liability for any investments, profits or losses you may incur as a result of this information.

456,"Jul 19, 2018 10:01AM ET",France to bolster anti-takeover measures amid foreign investment boom,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Michel RosePARIS (Reuters) - France wants to tighten takeover rules to protect companies deemed strategic as it walks a fine line between preserving a surge in investments and preventing its technology falling into the hands of foreign powers like China and the United States.In a wide-ranging business bill to be debated in the autumn, President Emmanuel Macron's government is proposing to widen the scope for state intervention and substantially increase the use of ""golden shares"" to protect national interests.Under the proposals, the finance minister could impose fines on investors who fail to seek prior approval to buy stakes in French companies deemed of strategic importance. These could be as high as 10 percent of the targeted company's annual revenues, according to a draft seen by Reuters.The minister could also suspend investors' voting rights or appoint a special trustee as part of the protective measures.The move comes after several national champions such as train-maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) changed flags in recent years under deals that many political heavyweights deemed unfair or detrimental to the state. General Electric 's (N:GE) acquisition of Alstom's power division - whose turbines equip all of France's nuclear reactors -  Technip  (PA:FTI)'s merger with U.S.-based FMC Technologies (N:FTI) and Chinese investors' increasing influence in Peugeot-Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Accor  (PA:ACCP) are other recent examples.They triggered intense national discussion over the means the government had to fend off such buyouts and led to parliamentary inquiries that questioned the absence of a U.S.-style legislative apparatus. In the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, has far-reaching powers to intervene and block foreign takeovers.While Macron is a former investment banker and advocate of free trade, he has shown willingness to head off foreign acquisitions when national interests may be at stake -- he temporarily nationalized French shipyard STX in July 2017 to prevent it falling into foreign hands, although he later approved its acquisition by Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT).He has pushed for the creation of European corporate champions, but has been criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.  ""This is a doctrine which, because it believes in free trade, knows that free trade cannot tolerate naivety,"" said Stanislas Guerini, a member of the president's majority in parliament and part of Macron's inner circle.BOOMING FOREIGN INVESTMENTSThe proposed anti-takeover legislation, which would increase powers given in a 2014 decree, is expected to be widely backed by a parliamentary majority and approved when it comes to a vote towards the end of 2018 or early 2019, Guerini said. Macron's party holds an outright majority in parliament.A boom in foreign investment since Macron came to office has fuelled the sense of urgency. Direct investments by both the United States and China jumped by more than 25 percent in 2017, according to trade agency Business France.Assets to be covered by the special powers will be identified in detail at a later stage by decree. But the government has already indicated that the scope would be extended to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space technology and data storage.Golden shares, which give special voting rights and the ability to block potential takeovers, could be distributed to the companies in France's state-shareholding portfolio if national interests are considered at risk.Firms in which France's state investment bank Bpifrance holds more than 5 percent would also be included, meaning companies ranging from carmakers PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France-KLM (PA:AIF) and energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) would fall under its umbrella.Lawyers interviewed by Reuters praised the ""golden share"" tool as it allows debt-ridden France to sell part of its national jewels to generate cash while retaining influence.""The full range is now comprehensive and efficient. It allows (the state) to cover all types of situations,"" said Pascal Bine, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Investors have been more ambivalent. ""It's very protectionist,"" said Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a shareholder advisory firm. ""But the French government has not made an excessive use of its control prerogatives (in recent cases).""Colette Neuville, head of an interest group representing minority shareholders, said: ""I am less opposed to this kind of thing than I was a few years ago.""The draft legislation stipulates that the list of companies that qualify for the ""golden share"" protection could not be extended after the law's adoption.EUROPEAN TRENDFrance is not alone in seeking to tighten rules on takeover by overseas buyers in Europe.Germany, which was spooked by the acquisition of robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) by China's Midea (SZ:000333), became the first European Union country to tighten its rules last year and is now looking at lowering the threshold at which it can intervene.Its new regulations allow its government to block moves that present a risk of critical technology being lost abroad.Italy passed a law last year to protect companies from hostile takeovers after French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) sharply increased its holding in broadcasting firm  Mediaset  (MI:MS) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).European Union leaders agreed last year to consider screening investments by state-owned Chinese firms, and France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments.A draft EU law that would limit the ability of non-EU firms to acquire companies and technology in the bloc remains under discussion."

This year, however, things are speeding up, according to an analysis by NKB Group, a blockchain investment bank.“Initially, it dazzled anarchists with the idea of a world without institutions. Then it baited investors with the rocket climb of cryptocurrency prices. Now it’s the large organizations that seek to utilize blockchain in what they do. 2018 is the year of enterprise proofs-of-concept,” the company wrote.The majority of the 500-richest companies in the world have already shown interest in the technology and are either running pilot projects or have already started using blockchains to move their data.“Most Fortune 500 companies seem to be testing blockchain in some shape or form. Next year, we should see the first major real-world adoptions. Financial services are the likely pioneers of widespread commercial use, as they began prototyping first and seem to have the greatest expertise and requirement,” NKB Group concluded.We can see financial companies and banks like Unicredit (MI:CRDI), UBS,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), and even the Bank of Scotland starting their own trials for cross-border payment processing and other administrative functions. Even central banks like the Bank of England are looking into ways in which blockchain technology could improve transaction settlement. In fact, this year’s exciting pilots may get our foot in the door of some innovative solutions that could change the way we do finance in 2019.In the retail industry, we see all sorts of companies from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) testing blockchain solutions primarily focused on supply chain management.NKB Group also found companies in the telecommunications, logistics, airline, and automotive industries piloting their own proofs of concept. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) already use this technology to store telemetry and service history data for their vehicles, the company noted."

Data published on Monday also showed that ""German exports rebounded in May, providing more evidence of a strengthening of the economy in the second quarter"", ING wrote. In Britain, some investors took the view that the resignation of Brexit minister David Davis could actually help deliver a softer way out of the European Union.

""I will not give up, believe me, I will not give up.""My team did an amazing job this weekend, we got so much support. Interesting tactics I would say from their side (Ferrari), but we'll do what we can to fight them.""Raikkonen held his hand up and admitted he had made a mistake.""At the third corner I locked the wheel so I ended up hitting Lewis on the rear corner. He spun, my bad,"" said the 2007 world champion.""It was my mistake. I deserved it,"" he added of the penalty. ""I took the 10 seconds and kept fighting.""Bottas was fourth with Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo fifth and Nico Hulkenberg sixth for  Renault  (PA:RENA).

(T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) is not an option as the carmakers look to strengthen their partnership while retaining their autonomy, alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn said on Friday. ""Anybody who will ask Nissan and Mitsubishi to become wholly owned subsidiaries of Renault has zero chance of getting a result,"" Ghosn told shareholders of Mitsubishi Motors at a meeting. He also serves as chief executive of France's Renault. The alliance was the world's top-selling passenger vehicle maker in 2017, but as the global auto industry consolidates, it is looking to strengthen its position before the 64-year-old Ghosn, its main architect, retires in the coming years after overseeing the partnership for nearly 20 years.Reuters reported in March that the carmakers were discussing a deeper tie-up, which could see the French government, a major shareholder in Renault, give up influence at Renault and the French carmaker relinquish control over Nissan.The three automakers have a unique partnership designed to leverage their combined scale to save on costs including R&D, parts procurement and production to better compete with rivals Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).They are also interlinked by their shareholding structure. Renault holds 43.4 percent of shares in Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Mitsubishi Motors joined the alliance in 2016 after Nissan took a 34 percent controlling stake in the smaller automaker. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa has said the alliance is not discussing a ""full merger"".Ghosn said that while the focus of the alliance was to sell more cars and increase profitability by reducing unnecessary duplication of processes, he wanted each of the three automakers to maintain their independence, which differentiated the group from Toyota and Volkswagen.""We need to work together ... to find a system by which what we have today, which is working very well, can continue in the future no matter who is leading the alliance,"" he said.""We need to prove that this is sustainable five years down the road, 10 years down the road, 15 years down the road.""In a Figaro interview published last week, Ghosn was upbeat about the prospect of securing a new deal for the alliance despite its extreme political sensitivity in France and Japan, saying a plan would need to be announced ""well before"" the end of his four-year term at the helm of Renault in 2022.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

French ""say on pay"" votes have become binding since the last rejection.This time Ghosn may squeak through with the backing of influential proxy advisor ISS, which recommended in a May 22 report that shareholders back a 2017 package that ""does not raise any significant concern"". Early investor soundings suggest razor-thin majority support at the June 15 meeting.However, Paris-based Proxinvest, another advisory firm, recommended a ""no"" vote on grounds that Ghosn's additional 9.2 million euros in Nissan pay was poorly disclosed and bonuses too high. ""The pay structure remains defective"", it said.A Renault spokesman declined to comment.A surprise rejection could cancel Ghosn's 1.45 million euro variable pay and affect 4.6 million euros in long-term performance shares, despite record Renault earnings last year. That would deal a significant blow to the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance's main architect just as he explores politically sensitive tie-up options.Renault currently owns 43.4 percent of Japanese affiliate Nissan, which in turn holds 34 percent of Mitsubishi and 15 percent of Renault but no voting rights in its French parent.MULTIPLE ROLESBesides heading Renault, Ghosn serves as chairman of all three carmakers and is described as CEO of their expanding alliance, piloted by a Dutch-registered management company with no direct shareholder oversight or independent administrators - a sore point for some investors.Government backing will likely be enough to secure Ghosn's renewal despite negative voting recommendations from ISS and Proxinvest, which both oppose the combining of chairman and CEO roles.In a letter urging Renault shareholders to approve Ghosn's new term, lead independent director Philippe Lagayette and two other longstanding board members cited his ""track record of high performance"" and increased operational delegation to Thierry Bollore, recently promoted to chief operating officer.And with the pay vote looking tight, the carmaking alliance brought forward its annual synergies disclosure - usually made in July - to announce 5.7 billion euros in performance savings for 2017, a 14 percent year-on-year gain.""Deeper convergence and increased synergies will cement the sustainability of the alliance for the long term,"" Ghosn said in the companies' statement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The industry sees a 40 percent rise in total sales volumes, and we are going to be much above the market trend,"" said Kargar.""We're talking about big growth in the region,"" he said, declining to give detailed regional sales targets.He expects overall industry sales to climb to 12.1 million units in 2022 from 8.8 million in 2017.Kargar, who joined Nissan last year from automaking partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) where he led sales and marketing for the same region, added that he expected to double market share in Saudi Arabia to 14 percent in 2022, from 7 percent last year when roughly 800,000 vehicles were sold in the country.Kargar said Nissan is also betting on more Nissan-branded sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and cheaper Datsun-branded cars to shore up sales in India, where it is struggling to expand and is far behind market leader  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI). It has focused on selling more SUVs in India, where SUV sales are fast climbing, fueled by rising consumer spending power.It also expects to raise its market share in South Africa to ""more than 15 percent"" by 2022, from 10 percent in 2017, Kargar said, by selling fewer pick-up trucks and more passenger cars.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

State Minister Jayakumar also said there was no question of engaging with London-listed Vedanta on reopening the copper smelter, and added that the shutdown would not have an impact on investment in the state.""Our stand is clear: the smelter will remain shut. An isolated incident like this is not going to hit investments in the state, as we have good infrastructure and provide attractive tax incentives,"" Jayakumar said.Tamil Nadu, home to more than 70 million people, is one of India's most industrialized states, sometimes called the ""Detroit of Asia"". Companies including BMW, Daimler, Hyundai, Ford, Nissan and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have factories in the state.Vedanta told Reuters in a statement last month that the smelter shutdown would impact ""prospective investor sentiments for investment in the state"", and would lead to a rise in local copper prices.The company is preparing an appeal against the state government's order to permanently shut the plant, sources have said, which could lead to a long-drawn out legal battle.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

IndyCar team owner Michael Andretti was also in the McLaren pits on Saturday.Brown said plans were progressing and he expected to make an announcement in coming months on whether McLaren would have a team in place for the 2019 IndyCar season.""We're seriously considering IndyCar, we have been doing due diligence for quite some time,"" Brown told reporters following Saturday qualifying.""As stated before if we are going to get into other forms of motorsport we need to do it in a way that doesn't compromise our Formula One activities or we won't consider it.""It needs to be commercially viable, something we feel we can be competitive in and fits our brand. ""It has to tick all those boxes.""We are not done with our due diligence yet but it is looking favorable so we'll take a decision in order to be prepared for 2019 some time in the coming months.""Double world champion Alonso competed in the Indianapolis 500 last year in an effort connected to Andretti Motorsport, leading the race before an engine failure ended his involvement.The Spaniard, now 36, has made winning the 'Triple Crown of Motorsport' a target and is competing in the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race in France next weekend with Toyota.If he wins that, his focus will turn Stateside again.The Triple crown is Indianapolis, Le Mans and, as far as Alonso is concerned, the Monaco Grand Prix, although it was originally held up as the F1 world championship. The debate is academic for Alonso, who has won both of the F1 elements anyway and is entering his 300th Grand Prix this weekend -- also the 50th anniversary of McLaren's first F1 win.McLaren won Indianapolis in 1974 and 1976 with Johnny Rutherford.""The Triple Crown is an attractive target because it is so difficult to achieve. These are the three biggest races in the world of motorsport,"" Alonso told Sky Sports television.""I don't want to just be a good driver, I want to be a complete driver and hopefully the best driver in the world.""It has been five years since the Spaniard's last F1 win with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) after taking both his titles with  Renault  (PA:RENA), and the prospects of a return to the top of the podium remain distant.While Alonso wants to be recognized as an all around driver, he has insisted at every opportunity that he is not done with the glamour series despite McLaren's struggles.McLaren and Alonso continue to have talks about a new contract and Brown hopes the Spaniard will remain with the team, though he refused to speculate whether that would be with Formula One, IndyCar or both.""He's been doing Formula One a long time and I think he is enjoying driving as much as he ever has,"" said Brown. ""I think he is driving better than he ever has.""He is a bit frustrated with Formula One being more of constructors championship than a drivers championship.""But he loves Formula One, loves world endurance so hopefully we will keep Fernando in the McLaren environment in some way shape or form.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But Volkswagen's new boss Herbert Diess said last month that spinning off Diesel & Turbo, Renk or motorcycle brand Ducati was a possibility as the group's top management reviews options for ""non-core"" assets.""When taking over MAN, (former chairman) Ferdinand Piech and I promised the workforce of Renk and Diesel & Turbo that we will not sell these divisions. The executive board also gave its word,"" works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in an interview.Diess has pledged to speed up Volkswagen's drive to become more efficient in the wake of its 2015 diesel emissions scandal, as it seeks to fund a costly shift to electric and self-driving cars. Plans include preparing the group's trucks division for a separate listing. ""We will discuss how we can further develop the engineering operations,"" Osterloh said. ""The business must not stand still. We also agree with Dr. Diess on this.""The works council controls half of the 20-seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, which decides on investment, plant closures and executive appointments, and can usually also count on the support of representatives from the group's home region of Lower Saxony. Separately, Osterloh said the group's core VW brand was making good progress with cost cuts agreed in its ""future pact"" between management and labour, with 93 percent of planned full-year savings already identified.""The numbers show that we will achieve the planned efficiency gains from the future pact of slightly more than 2 billion euros for this year,"" said Osterloh, who sits on Volkswagen's supervisory board. Designed mainly to make cuts to high-cost operations in Germany, the future pact aims to make 3.7 billion euros in annual savings by 2020 and up to 23,000 job cuts without forced layoffs by 2025.The plan helped boost profitability at the VW brand last year, though margins continue to lag rivals including  Renault  (PA:RENA), PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203).Osterloh expects Diess, a proven cost-cutter, to increase synergies between the group's main car brands VW, Seat and Skoda. At VW, synergies should get a particular boost in 2019/2020 when the first electric models roll off a new MEB modular platform and the redesigned top-selling Golf hits dealerships, he said. Osterloh also said further steps would be needed to boost output at Skoda to help it keep up with booming demand, even though some production is being shifted to Germany to relieve its stretched Czech factories.Asked whether a decision in April to move some production of sport-utility vehicles to a VW plant in Osnabrueck had solved the bottlenecks at Skoda, Osterloh said: ""For the moment, yes, but certainly not in a lasting way.""""We will check overall utilisation across the group. Then we will look at the regions where demand is coming from and will take a decision,"" he said, pointing to the group's budget round in November.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I would be somewhat surprised at that one.""Drivers are allowed three power units per season but only two MGU-Ks, two energy stores and two control units without incurring a 10 place penalty for the subsequent race.Ricciardo, who was third in Montreal last year behind the Mercedes pair of Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, was already on his second MGU-K after a failure in Bahrain.Renault, whose engines are branded Tag Heuer in the Red Bull, are bringing an upgrade to Canada but Newey said it would not be a massive step up.""It's about one percent (more power), which is a tenth of a second so it's worth having but it's not a make or break,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Accenture denied its software was unfair to motorists and said its focus was on increasing clients' efficiency.""Solutions of this type, which enable companies to assess and manage their products, are commonplace across industries. They help companies analyze spare part visibility and availability,"" it said in a statement.Boutboul is claiming 33 million euros from Accenture over what he says is damage to his reputation because Accenture broke European competition rules. He says it did this by using non-public information taken from Renault to help configure the pricing systems it set up for PSA and potentially other manufacturers. His lawsuit did not specify the exact information.Boutboul's lawyer said Boutboul could not comment on the details of an ongoing legal action. Accenture said it rejected his claims.Renault, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Peugeot said their pricing strategies for spare parts were legal, did not take advantage of car owners and were focused on efficiency and ensuring availability for motorists.Peugeot said in a statement its replacement parts strategy ""consists in offering ranges of spare parts that meet the needs of all customers, regardless of their budget, at the highest level of reliability and safety."" Renault said it ""strives to provide its customers with a wide variety of quality spare parts, the price of which is calculated based on parameters that Renault considers fair and equitable"".   JLR said it used Partneo to ""deliver consistency in pricing across our spare parts range to ensure that we are appropriately priced against our competition"".France's competition regulator said it had examined the software and did not see a reason to open a full anti-trust investigation, without explaining its thinking.Renault said it was unaware of any of its non-public pricing information being shared with other carmakers. PSA said it rejected Boutboul's accusations, but did not answer detailed questions about how its software was configured.Accenture said its pricing software, called Partneo ""does not share confidential or sensitive data between clients"".    ""PERCEIVED VALUE METHODOLOGY""In the past two decades, pricing software has become widely used.Aaron Roth, Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, said using software to try and identify the highest prices people were willing to pay was merely an extension of long-established practice among manufacturers and retailers.""Already, prices for products are set trying to maximize profits,"" he said.In a 2013 presentation to BMW, Accenture claimed its software had, on average, allowed clients to increase parts prices by 15 percent.But the recommended increases varied widely from product to product. Accenture recommended in presentations seen by Reuters to six clients, including PSA, Honda and Volvo, that prices of many replacement parts should be doubled.An October 2013 presentation to carmaker Volvo said that the software had led to ""yearly gains achieved"" at seven car and truck makers of a combined $415 million a year.Volvo said it did not use Partneo but declined to comment on the presentation. PSA declined to comment on whether or how much it increased prices. Honda did not respond to a request for comment.Accenture said in its presentations that Partneo relies on a ""perceived value pricing methodology"".While manufacturers often seek a specific margin on parts, the software attempts to identify those parts for which consumers would be happy to pay above the typical mark-up.It selected these based on a product appearing to a car buyer to be more valuable or expensive to produce, client presentations show.Accenture noted in a 2009 presentation to France's PSA that customer perceptions of the intrinsic value of a part are often based on factors like size, weight, and material of an item like a shiny brand badge or a cog.In one presentation to Mitsubishi, it suggested the Japanese carmaker lift the price of a silvery model badge from 14.42 euros to 87.49 euros, an increase of 507 percent. Mitsubishi declined to comment on whether it used the software or increased its prices.The car parts business has long been highly profitable, industry analysts say.While manufacturers struggle to make a profit margin of more than 10 percent when selling a vehicle, ""spare parts gross margin can go up to 90 percent,"" Accenture said in a presentation for BMW's South African arm in 2013.BMW said it decided not to use Partneo but declined to elaborate further.   PRICING SUPERVISIONAlthough the market for new cars is highly transparent and competitive, the market for spare parts is less liquid and transparent, partly because some components can be protected by trademarks or patents, analysts say.Car manufacturers have long been accused by insurers and motoring groups from Australia to the United States of charging too much for spare parts.Partneo mainly focuses on increasing parts prices based on their appearance but it also has a feature that tries to avoid potential insurer reaction to price increases of certain items.The software categorizes components as those ""with or without 3rd party pricing supervision"" -- prices monitored by specialist publications or insurers -- according to three client presentations seen by Reuters.For example, in France, Securite Reparation Automobile (SRA), a group backed by insurers, measures car parts inflation and publishes this in the hope it will help exert downward pressure on parts inflation.According to Boutboul's complaint, Partneo avoided hiking prices of the specific parts whose price is closely followed by SRA. Accenture declined to comment on whether the software still operated in this way.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

487,"May 30, 2018 01:40PM ET",Motor racing: Aerodynamics head De Beer leaves struggling Williams,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Williams replaced head of aerodynamics Dirk De Beer on Wednesday after a troubled start to the Formula One season that has left the former champions languishing in last place with only four points from six races.The team, who have the same engines as championship leaders Mercedes, said in a statement the South African had stepped down with immediate effect.Dave Wheater has been handed De Beer's title, while chief engineer Doug McKiernan assumes responsibility over the aerodynamic and design direction of the car.De Beer's departure followed that of chief designer Ed Wood, who left earlier in May for personal reasons.This year's FW41 car has disappointed in the hands of Canadian teenager Lance Stroll and Russian rookie Sergey Sirotkin.The car had been presented in February with technical head Paddy Lowe saying the team had ""pursued a very different aerodynamic concept which has allowed us some significant progress in aerodynamic performance"".However Williams failed to score a point until Stroll finished eighth in Azerbaijan at the end of April, and that remains the only race in which they have scored.Stroll finished two laps down and last of those classified in Monaco at the weekend, while Sirotkin was one place ahead of the Canadian in 16th.De Beer joined from Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) last year and was previously at Sauber,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Lotus.McKiernan joined from McLaren, where he was head of aerodynamics, earlier this year.Williams were the only team other than Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull to have a driver on the podium last year, with Stroll third in Azerbaijan, but have not won a race since 2012.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Our problem has always been on Saturdays... if we can improve our Saturdays, then our races will be competitive. ""If we could just get a little bit more at the end of Q3 (the final phase of qualifying) on peak power, there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to give Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Mercedes regularly a hard time.""Ricciardo started on pole position in Monaco on Sunday, the team's first in two years, and won despite having a power unit problem from lap 28.Verstappen set the fastest race lap, the fourth time in six grands prix that Red Bull have done that. ""The FIA understand the situation we're in and there's no hard and fast deadline,"" said Horner of the engine decision. Renault have previously said they would need to know by the end of May because of the long lead times involved in manufacturing.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

489,"May 28, 2018 10:11AM ET",Germany grills Daimler boss over extent of Vito van emissions fix,nan,"By Edward TaylorBERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Transport Ministry quizzed  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche on Monday over how many Mercedes-Benz vans and cars need to be fixed after a regulator said it had found illegal software in one of its models.The luxury carmaker was summoned to a closed-door meeting to answer questions about software devices found in Mercedes-Benz vans by Germany's KBA motor vehicle authority.Daimler was last week ordered by KBA to recall Vito vans fitted with 1.6 liter diesel engines because it said they breached emissions rules. Daimler has said it will appeal against KBA's decision to classify the software as illegal and contest its findings in court if necessary, although it said it was cooperating fully.German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said Daimler had been given until June 15 to come up with a solution to the Vito delivery van's emissions issues following ""an in-depth exchange about highly complex technical questions"".""At a further meeting in 14 days, concrete results will be on the table,"" Scheuer added in a statement.Asked how the meeting went, Zetsche told Reuters: ""It was a good discussion. We will see each other again in 14 days.""Global carmakers are facing a regulatory clamp-down since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted to deliberately cheating diesel emissions tests in 2015.Regulators are now focusing on narrowing the gap between pollution levels ""on the road"" when compared to exhaust emissions measured during testing.Germany's Transport Ministry said the Vito had been equipped with a software device which manipulated the an emissions filtering system which relies on injecting a urea-based liquid to help neutralize nitrogen oxide emissions in exhaust fumes.CRIMINAL INQUIRYSome Mercedes-Benz models, including the Vito, use diesel engines supplied by Daimler's partner  Renault  (PA:RENA). French prosecutors opened a probe into Renault in January 2017 after the country's consumer watchdog DGCCRF found engine software deactivated anti-pollution functions.Daimler has previously said Mercedes vehicles being scrutinized by KBA were fitted with a Renault supplied OM622 engine, which had been used in around 1,000 Mercedes-Benz Vito tourer models in Germany. Under European rules, carmakers rather than suppliers are responsible for the legality of road certification of each model they sell, even if engines and software were supplied by third party. Daimler and Robert Bosch, which supplies engine management systems, are both being investigated by criminal prosecutors in Stuttgart. Asked whether French prosecutors were being briefed as part of the Mercedes probe, the Stuttgart prosecutor's office said only that it was in touch with foreign authorities.Renault declined to comment.Daimler said on Monday that no diesel engines supplied by Renault were used in Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the United States, where the discovery of illegal software devices carries far higher penalties than in Europe.European rules on using software to manage exhaust emissions filtering systems are more lax than in the United States, allowing carmakers greater leeway to switch off exhaust filtering systems if ""engine damage"" can be reduced as a result. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, without citing sources, said regulators are probing around 40,000 Mercedes-Benz Vito vans and 80,000 C-Class models for possible software that allowed them to emit excess pollution without detection.European carmakers had invested heavily in diesel engines, which produce less carbon dioxide but more of other pollutants blamed for causing respiratory disease than petrol engines.However, German cities are now entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets to bring air pollution levels in line with European Union rules.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Verstappen, 20, is on a lucrative long-term contract but has had a season full of mistakes and crashes. Horner hoped a new deal with Ricciardo could be reached ""in the next couple of months"" but recognized much would depend on what engine Red Bull had next season.The former champions use  Renault  (PA:RENA) power units but have been linked to Honda, now with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso.Honda's engines have improved considerably after three dismal years with McLaren, and France's Pierre Gasly finished seventh for Toro Rosso on Sunday.Mercedes say they are not looking beyond their immediate ""family"" at present, with Finland's Valtteri Bottas performing well as Hamilton's team mate, and Ferrari could retain veteran Kimi Raikkonen.While Ricciardo would be popular, as a driver of Italian extraction with a reputation for thrilling overtakes, Ferrari also see Sauber's 20-year-old Charles Leclerc as a longer-term option.Whatever the reality, Ricciardo is putting himself front, side and center in the shop window, knowing that any interest adds to his bargaining power.""We’ll see what the others think. I can’t pay myself but for sure I feel I’ve done a really good job in the first six races,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The DIHK, Germany's main chambers of commerce group, described the latest move as a ""provocation"".BMW (DE:BMWG) shares fell 1.7 percent and Daimler (DE:DAIGn) shares slid 2.8 percent, while Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) dropped 2.5 percent.  Renault  (PA:RENA), exposed to the U.S. market via its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan (T:7201), fell 1.7 percent.The sell-off does not reflect the full gravity of the threat, analysts pointed out, because the outcome of the trade review is uncertain and still months away.""Donald Trump is obviously not thinking about how to prevent a trade war,"" said Thomas Altmann at Frankfurt asset manager QC Partners. ""Import duties on cars would be a nightmare for the German auto industry and would lead to a massive sales impact.""BMW said it was ""committed to free trade worldwide"", adding that barrier-free access to markets was a key driver of ""growth, welfare and employment throughout the global economy"".Spartanburg, South Carolina is home to BMW's biggest global plant, shipping 70 percent of its output overseas to make the German carmaker the leading U.S. vehicle exporter by value.Mercedes maker Daimler said it was ""monitoring the situation carefully"", while Audi and Porsche parent Volkswagen did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.If the review ultimately led to new tariffs the disruption to the car industry and its supply chains would be global, and keenly felt by the Germans.Announcing the probe, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross cited ""evidence that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry"". EU passenger car imports from the United States were worth 6.2 billion euros ($7.3 billion)last year, while the bloc's U.S. exports topped 37 billion euros, according to Brussels-based industry association ACEA.BMW and Mercedes have expanded production capacity in the United States. But along with VW and Audi they have also invested billions in Mexico factories to supply the U.S. market.German automakers assembled 804,000 cars in U.S. plants last year but exported another 657,000 to North America from Germany, according to the VDA industry association.The U.S. production figure represents a 29 percent increase over three years, the association emphasized, while German exports were down 25 percent. However, German brands increased Mexico production by 46 percent in 2017, mostly for the U.S.""The German auto industry is watching current developments closely and with concern,"" the VDA said, adding that its carmakers and suppliers employed 116,500 U.S. workers.China, which has just reduced its own car import tariffs, was at pains on Thursday to welcome German firms and investments, with Premier Li Keqiang talking up relations after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Volvo Cars, the Geely-owned (HK:0175) automaker currently preparing its stock-exchange debut, could also be hit hard. While the Swedish brand is currently opening a U.S. factory to build S60 sedans, it will remain reliant on imports of its Chinese-built XC90 flagship SUV for years under current plans.""Volvo believes strongly in the benefits of investing and contributing to the main markets in which it seeks to sell cars, and we are investing and creating thousands of jobs in South Carolina,"" it said, declining to share import projections.""We'll always adapt to the realities of the market,"" Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in Detroit earlier this year, when asked about the threat of U.S. tariffs.

That could lead to tariffs of up to 25 percent on the same ""national security"" grounds used to impose U.S. steel and aluminum duties in March. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday the investigation was still in its early stages but that other countries' high, artificial barriers, such as tariffs and other interventions, have skewed the marketplace. ""Now it's very difficult to get back to a reciprocal arrangement,"" Ross said in an interview on CNBC, a day after announcing the probe, which could lead to new U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles.The probe, launched under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, will look at whether vehicle and parts imports are threatening the industry's health and ability to research and develop advanced technologies, Ross said on Wednesday.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it strongly opposes the move. ""If this proposal is carried out, it would deal a staggering blow to the very industry it purports to protect and would threaten to ignite a global trade war,"" chamber President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Donohue said in a statement. He urged the government to reverse course.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the U.S. move was based on flimsy logic and clearly linked to talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA partner Canada is the largest exporter of auto products to the United States. Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industries and Commerce dismissed as farfetched the national security justification for a probe. ""We almost have to take this as a provocation,"" DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said.Together German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen AG control more than 90 percent of the North American premium auto market. Tariffs would hit Germany particularly hard and shave 0.16 percent off the economic output of Europe's largest economy, the influential Ifo think tank said. ""No other country has higher absolute losses to fear than Germany,"" said Gabriel Felbermayr, foreign trade expert at Ifo.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the European Union should be united in its response to the threat of U.S. tariffs. The probe comes ahead of midterm elections in the United States in November that will determine whether Republican President Donald Trump's party retains control of Congress. It is seen as part of Trump's ""America First"" promise to win back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors.United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said he supports Trump's trade policies and his efforts to protect American workers from competition from low-wage countries. But that did not mean the UAW was ready to support Republicans running for Congress in the midterms. ""The Republican Congress and Senate, they have totally ignored the needs of working men and women in this country,"" Williams said.U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said possible auto tariffs are ""deeply misguided,"" and urged the administration ""to remain focused on addressing China's trade practices."" Pointing to a mixed bag of effects on U.S. producers after the metals tariffs, analysts were cautious about predicting major gains for U.S. companies and workers from the process.""Measures like this are ultimately about protecting American manufacturing jobs in states that voted for Trump rather than national security,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston said in a note.""We don't see these tariffs (if proposed) lasting forever and we think (they) will ultimately cost American jobs.""Shares of General Motors Co (N:GM) rose 1.5 percent and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) was up 1.7 percent in early afternoon trading.In Europe, BMW (DE:BMWG) and Daimler (DE:DAIGn) shares dropped as much as 3.5 percent during the session, while Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) closed down 2.5 percent. Together the three automakers control more than 90 percent of the North American premium auto market. Renault  SA (PA:RENA), exposed to the U.S. market via its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, fell as much as 2.1 percent. Europe's auto sector index (SXAP) lost 2 percent and was on track for its worst day in 10 months.Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), which count the United States as a key market. The probe sparked a broad sell-off in automakers' shares across the region. [MKTS/GLOB]Toyota dropped 3 percent and Honda slid 3.4 percent.Toyota, which has 10 U.S. plants and 1,500 U.S. dealers, said in a statement that any tariffs ""could hurt American jobs"" and raise costs for consumers.The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they will monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests.In addition to tariffs, Commerce Secretary Ross cited other non-tariff barriers such as standards, licensing and ""all kinds of other games.""""The stupidity is that we let ourselves get into this box of extremely low rates,"" he told CNBC. The United States imported 8.3 million vehicles in 2017 worth $192 billion, including 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics.At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion.(This refiled version restores dropped word ""of"" in first paragraph)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It's a good feeling.""Hamilton's win followed on from the lucky victory that fell into his lap in Azerbaijan two weekends ago, but Sunday had nothing to do with chance and all to do with the champions being back to their best.He now has 95 points to Vettel's 78 after five rounds of the 21-race championship. Mercedes regained the lead in the constructors' standings and are now 27 points clear of Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) who had 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen retire from the race.Australian Daniel Ricciardo was fifth for Red Bull, ahead of Denmark's Kevin Magnussen for Haas and Spaniards Carlos Sainz ( Renault  (PA:RENA)) and Fernando Alonso (eighth for McLaren).Sainz's points lifted Renault ahead of McLaren and into fourth place by a single point.Mexican Sergio Perez was ninth for Force India and Monegasque rookie Charles Leclerc took the final point for Sauber. While Hamilton pulled away cleanly at the start, and Vettel passed Bottas into the first corner for second place, there was carnage behind as Romain Grosjean spun his Haas in a cloud of smoke.The Frenchman then collected the Renault of Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly's Toro Rosso in a major smash, fortunately without injury, that brought out the safety car for the first six laps.Stewards gave him two penalty points and imposed a three-place grid drop for the next race in Monaco. When racing resumed Vettel was first of the leading group to pit but the Mercedes pair stayed out on what turned out to be a one-stop strategy, with Hamilton immediately smashing the lap record.When Vettel made his second stop during a late virtual safety car period, after Esteban Ocon parked up his Force India by the side of the track, it backfired and he lost places instead of gaining anything.""We couldn't make the tires last,"" said Vettel. ""I think it was the right thing to do.""Even in the end, with the fresher set, I wasn't able to attack,"" he added. Verstappen, whose season has been littered with collisions, also nearly wrecked his race when he hit the rear of Canadian Lance Stroll's Williams and lost a front wing end-plate.""Feels nice to be on the podium and nice to have a good clean race,"" said Verstappen.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The answer is no,"" Le Maire told reporters.""Do we accept that the United States is the economic gendarme of the planet? The answer is no.""Do we accept the vassalization of Europe in commercial matters? The answer is no.""Both he and Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz had spoken to their U.S. counterpart Steven Mnuchin, urging him to consider exemptions or delays for companies already present in the country.Le Maire said he was seeking concrete exemptions for countries already present in Iran, including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Total, Sanofi (PA:SASY), Danone and Peugeot. Scholz had also asked for concrete measures to help German companies, Handelsblatt newspaper reported.The 2015 agreement between major powers and Iran set limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Europeans fear a collapse of the deal could intensify conflicts in the Middle East.Germany, France and Britain want talks to be held in a broader format to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its regional military activities, including in Syria and Yemen.""The extent to which we can keep this deal alive ... is something we need to discuss with Iran,"" said Merkel, who earlier spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the issue.Divisions in Iran over how it should respond to the U.S. pullout were illustrated as senior cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran University on Friday that European nations could not be trusted.President Hassan Rouhani had said on Tuesday that Tehran would remain in the deal, provided its benefits stayed in force with its remaining signatories.Iran's foreign minister will travel to Moscow on May 14 and meet his Russian counterpart, Russia's RIA news agency said, citing a Russian foreign ministry official.""DAMAGE LIMITATION""Iran said it had asked Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) to announce whether it would go ahead with a plane deal with Tehran following the U.S. pullout.That appears unlikely after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday that licenses for the planemaker and rival  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to sell passenger jets to Iran would be revoked.Le Maire said Paris would seek to strengthen Europe's ability to block sanctions and provide investment finance to companies. He called for the creation of a body to monitor the implementation of EU sanctions rules.Some fear Europe's room for maneuver is limited. ""The Europeans are in the weaker position because they are not united,"" said Peter Beyer, Germany's commissioner for transatlantic relations. Trump's strength was that he did not need unity, Beyer added.French exports to Iran doubled to 1.5 billion euros ($1.79 billion) last year, driven by sales of aircraft and automobile parts, according to customs data.Exports of German goods to Iran rose by around 400 million euros to 3 billion euros. Around 120 German firms have operations with their own staff in Iran, including  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), and some 10,000 German companies trade with Iran.""We are ready to talk to all the companies concerned about what we can do to minimize the negative consequences,"" Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio. ""That means, it is concretely about damage limitation"".The U.S. ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, said firms should question the morality of doing business with Iran.""Germany, France and Britain, the 'EU3', say themselves that Iran poses a threat. Do they want to do business with a threat?"" Bild newspaper quoted him as saying.Altmaier said Germany wanted to avoid ""a spiral of escalation"" in transatlantic trade relations.Merkel said at a church event in the western German city of Muenster: ""It is in our interest to have a strong transatlantic relationship"".But she also said: ""If everybody does what they like, then this is bad news for the world."""

But the severity of Washington's stance has raised doubts about their viability.Le Maire said he had asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for temporary or permanent exemptions for French companies, citing carmaker PSA, drug giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) and food group Danone among those affected - in addition to Renault and oil major Total.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also toughened the government's tone in an interview with Le Parisien.""We're telling the Americans that it's their business what sanctions they impose, but we consider the extraterritoriality of these measures unacceptable,"" Le Drian said.

Japan's biggest automaker expects operating profit to ease to 2.3 trillion yen ($21.02 billion) in the year to March 2019, slightly higher than a median forecast for 2.19 trillion yen from 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Toyota's forecast is based on the assumption that the yen will trade around 105 yen to the U.S. dollar in the current financial year, compared with 111 yen in the year just ended. A stronger local currency can dent profits repatriated from overseas and raise the cost of finished products and parts when they are shipped between countries.A hit to earnings will make it harder for Toyota, the world's most profitable automaker to continue investing in new technologies and products at a time when global automakers are competing fiercely to develop self-driving cars, electric vehicles, and connected technologies. It posted an operating profit of 2.4 trillion yen in the year just ended, outpacing rivals Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) for the fifth straight year. This resulted in an operating margin of 8.2 percent, roughly level with Daimler's 8.15 percent and trailing Indian maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's 11.3 percent, the highest among major global automakers.The automaker is targeting total group sales of 10.5 million vehicles globally in the year to March, slightly more than 10.44 million vehicles last year. In the year to December 2017, Toyota was the world's No. 3 maker of passenger cars, following the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance (T:7201) (PA:RENA) (T:7211) and Volkswagen. It expects sales in North America, its biggest market, toease slightly to 2.8 million units, while sales in Asia are seen rising to 1.67 million units from 1.54 million last year.

511,"May 03, 2018 12:20PM ET",Corporate Europe senses relief as euro falls from peak,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - The recent recovery in the dollar has raised hopes that currency turbulence for European corporates will now subside, after first quarter earnings took a hit from the stronger euro.Chemical groups Bayer (DE:BAYGn) on Thursday became the latest euro zone company affected by the strong euro, cutting its guidance and saying sales will likely fall in 2018. Belgian peer  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) and healthcare firm Fresenius (DE:FREG) also blamed adverse forex markets for their poor updates. ""You're definitely seeing the impact of the currency headwinds in the first quarter results, and also the European economies have slowed relative to last year,"" said Will Hamlyn, investment analyst at Manulife Asset Management.The euro has been on a steady rising path since mid 2017, reaching a more than three-year high against the dollar in February and capping gains for European stock markets. While that was seen as a sign of health of Europe's economic recovery and signaled growing foreign investor appetite for the region's equities, it curbed the value of overseas earnings and hurt competitiveness.(Citi Economic Surprise Indicator: https://reut.rs/2rens0X) Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) estimates that every rise in the euro reduces European earnings growth by five percent. Exporting heavyweights  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Continental (DE:CONG) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have all reported last month hits to their results from the strong euro.In April however the single currency has fallen rapidly to a four-month low against the dollar, with the greenback buoyed by the U.S. Treasury yields topping three percent and expectations the Federal Reserve will further raise interest rates.That in turn helped euro zone stocks rise 4.4 percent in April, outperforming Wall Street for the second straight month, and shrug off slower earnings growth and weeks of disappointing data that signaled slowing economic growth.""For the moment we've seen the headwind peak and that may stabilize this quarter,"" said Pierre Bose, head of European strategy, International Wealth Management at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Wealth Management.""We've already seen a very significant amount of the euro's appreciation take effect on earnings so at this point in time what matters most is just how much more hawkish people become on the ECB,"" he added.(Euro boom hurts exporters: https://reut.rs/2rihADY)Bose however said markets appeared to underestimate the speed at which the European Central Bank would tighten policy, saying the euro would eventually strengthen again.German companies listed in the broad HDAX (GDAXHI) index, whose U.S. dollar sales exposure is estimated by DZ Bank at 28 percent of total turnover, also rose 4 percent last month. The U.S benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) instead gained just 0.3 percent. In a note this week, Deutsche Bank strategists said they would lift their 2018 European earnings growth forecast to seven percent from 4.5 percent should the euro fade back to end-2017 levels. Manulife's Hamlyn agreed that a further fall in the euro could be welcome news for European companies, although the initial impact of the April decline was likely to be limited.""It needs to come back down to 1.15 really to create relief for a lot of these companies,"" he said. The last time the euro traded at that level against the dollar was in July 2017. On Thursday the euro rose off four-month lows as the dollar's recent rally came to a halt after the U.S. Federal Reserve did little to alter market expectations for further interest rate rises this year. Even though the euro remained more than four percent below the peak hit in February, that dampened investor appetite for European stocks on Thursday, highlighting how sensitive shares in the continent are to currency swings. But for Gerhard Schwarz, Head of Equity & Cross Asset Strategy at Baader Bank in Munich, the currency outlook for corporate Europe looked favorable, even though overall earnings growth was set to slow compared to 2017 due the slowing economic growth.""There is a good chance the euro would weaken again,"" he said, saying the currency could reach $1.12-1.15 during the second half of the year, likely bolstering corporate earnings, although any lift could be delayed by hedging policies. ""The euro has certainly has been profiting from expectations the ECB will tighten policy following the Fed's path but this, I think, will be subdued and take place much later that consensus expects,"" he added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The use cases will range from autonomous payments to supply chain. MOBI, which was launched on Wednesday, currently includes about 30 companies, with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Bosch, and Blockchain at Berkeley acting as founding members.The group seeks to accelerate blockchain adoption and ensure safer, greener, and more affordable mobility. According to MOBI’s website, the use cases the group will focus on include the following:Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital assets investment group BKCM, commented on the initiative in a note to investors:“This is a tectonic shift in the tech landscape that has the potential to disrupt the growth plans of legacy tech into the auto.”He stressed that the most significant part of such projects is data.“MOBI is doing the end around and making that data self-sovereign and giving the consumer the control over their data property rights,” he added.MOBI is led by Chris Ballinger, who previously worked as CFO and head of mobility services at the Toyota Research Institute.The IOTA Foundation, the entity behind the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain project, has also joined the working group.“We are proud to be a member of the MOBI and partnering with other leading global companies to drive industry standards that unlock the potential of DLT [distributed ledger technology] for the mobility sector,” IOTA’s co-founders Dominik Schiener and David Sønstebø were quoted as saying in a blog announcement.In February 2018, Bosch announced plans to test IOTA for a driverless car project.This is not the first occasion that DLT, as blockchain is also referred to, has flirted with the auto market. At the end of February, German luxury car maker Porsche and blockchain startup XAIN were testing the technology for various vehicle features. XAIN is now part of MOBI as well.In March, Mercedes-Benz brand owner Daimler launched its own cryptocurrency called MobiCOIN, planning it as a reward for those dedicated to eco-driving. Despite the similarities in spelling, MobiCOIN has nothing to do with the MOBI working group.The full list of the MOBI members runs as follows: Accenture, Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Services USA, Beyond Protocol Inc, BigchainDB, Blockchain at Berkeley, BMW, Bosch, Chronicled, ConsenSys Systems, Context Labs, Crypto Valley Association, Dashride, Deon Digital AG, Digital Twin Labs, DOVU, Fetch.ai, FOAM, Ford, General Motors, Hyperledger, IBM, the IOTA Foundation, Luxoft, MotionWerk, NuCypher, Oaken Innovations, Ocean Protocol, Outlier Ventures, Renault, Ride Austin, Shareing, Shift, Spherical Analytics, the Trusted IoT Alliance, VeChain, Xain, and ZF Friedrichshafen AG.MOBI’s CEO praised the technology: “Blockchain and related trust-enhancing technologies are poised to redefine the automotive industry and how consumers purchase, insure and use vehicles.”The new working group is apparently built on top of the Blockchain Mobility Consortium, which was formed in 2017."

514,"May 01, 2018 02:10PM ET","Police teargas anarchists at Paris May Day rally, arrest over 200 people",nan,"By Antoine Boddaert and Lucien LibertPARIS (Reuters) - French police arrested over 200 people and used water cannon and teargas on Tuesday against masked protesters who smashed shop windows and hurled petrol bombs, hijacking a planned peaceful May Day rally by labor unions.The clashes came against a backdrop of union discontent with President Emmanuel Macron over his plans to stimulate France's economy and spur jobs growth by loosening labor regulations.Riot police in Paris had warned on Monday of possible clashes with far-left anarchist groups, known as Black Blocs, after a call on social media to make Tuesday a ""Revolutionary Day"".Authorities said around 1,200 masked and hooded protesters garbed in black turned up on the sidelines of the annual May Day demonstration by labor unions.More than 200 anarchists were arrested and four people, including a police officer, were lightly wounded in the ensuing disturbances, Paris police chief Michel Delpuech told a news conference.Protesters smashed windows of businesses, including a  Renault  (PA:RENA) garage and McDonalds restaurant near the Austerlitz train station in eastern Paris. They also ransacked shops, torched cars and scrawled anti-capitalist graffiti on walls before eventually being dispersed by police.Interior Minister Gerard Collomb condemned the violence and said everything was being done to apprehend the culprits.Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticized the protesters for covering their faces. ""When you have sincere convictions, you demonstrate with your face unmasked,"" he said. ""Those who wear hoods are the enemies of democracy."" The protesters chanted anti-fascist slogans, waved old Soviet flags and anti-government banners and threw firecrackers. Some started to erect barricades.David Le Bars, a police union official, told BFM TV that security services had opted to let the protesters smash things rather than engage them to avoid casualties on either side that could exacerbate tensions.""They came to hit capitalist symbols and burn cops. When you come with Molotov cocktails, it's to burn cops,"" he said, pointing to clashes on May 1 last year that saw one police officer seriously burnt.DISCONTENT Under a union campaign to foil Macron's economic reforms, railway staff have begun three months of nationwide rolling strikes against a planned overhaul of state-run railway SNCF. Discontent over Macron's policies has spread beyond the railways and the May Day protests were intended to send a message of defiance to the former investment banker, who is currently on a trip to Australia.Earlier on Tuesday Macron reiterated that he would not back down on his reform agenda.Unions put the number of peaceful protesters at Tuesday's main May Day rally in Paris at about 55,000, though police put it at around 20,000. The numbers were relatively small compared to other recent demonstrations.Police said the Black Blocs had mixed into a second rally of 14,500 people set up alongside the official union movement.Opposition conservative and far-right politicians accused Macron's government of being insufficiently prepared for the violent protests and criticized it for not cracking down more heavily on anarchists.Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, said he believed far-right groups were responsible for the violence.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

515,"May 01, 2018 02:10AM ET",Euro's boom spells corporate gloom for region's exporters,nan,"By Alasdair Pal and Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - A strong euro has helped U.S. companies extend their sales outperformance over Europe to multi-year highs in the first quarter, according to Reuters data - though experts expect the trend to begin to reverse later this year.Renewed confidence in the European economy and persistent weakness in the dollar have driven the euro up 16 percent against the U.S. currency from the first quarter last year to the end of March 2018.That means euro zone companies reporting first-quarter earnings for 2018 have seen dollar revenues shrink by roughly a sixth in a year. Some 74 percent of companies on the U.S. S&P 500 that have reported in first quarter have beaten analysts' estimates for sales, compared with just 22 percent on Europe's Stoxx 600, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.The spread between the two is the highest since I/B/E/S/ began collating comparable data in the first quarter of 2011.(Graphic: Euro boom hurts continent's exporters - https://reut.rs/2JGfoNp)Exporting heavyweights  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Continental (DE:CONG) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have all reported hits to their results from the strong euro in the last week.Euro zone exporters suffer from a strong currency as they make large chunks of their sales and revenues in foreign currencies, which are then worth less when translated back into euros.The rising euro also results in higher costs and a pressure to raise prices, potentially making exporters less competitive.Daimler (DE:DAIGn) said the strong euro would dampen revenue growth this year, while Sanofi said a stronger euro had a negative effect of 8.3 percent on sales in the first quarter. [nL8N1S40Z4]Euro zone industrials, and consumer cyclicals, sectors dominated by exporters, have been delivering weaker than expected first-quarter revenues, Reuters data shows, with some of the biggest negative earnings surprises.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said currency effects were to blame for a disconnect between earnings growth beats and stocks' performance. ""We believe this has been a direct consequence of investors' concerns about FX downgrades causing further downside risks to earnings,"" they said. Some of the region's biggest drinks makers all said the strong euro would crimp profits. Heineken  (AS:HEIN) said the strong euro would wipe 200 million euros ($247 million) off operating profit this year based on current exchange rates. In mid-February, it had put the figure at 190 million euros. [nL8N1RV1JR] Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) also increased its estimate of the euro's negative impact, to 200 million from its previous estimate of 180 million, and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) said foreign exchange movements would knock 17 to 18 million euros off full-year operating profit. [nL8N1RV1PM] [nL8N1RW0TB]Overall each 10 percent move higher in the euro takes around 6 percent off earnings per share (EPS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said, and 70 percent of the time the euro has strengthened, euro area equities have underperformed in local terms. The strong euro is also part of the rationale for some brokers recommending investors shift from the more cyclical parts of the market to defensives, as cyclical sectors are both more exposed to global growth and to the negative currency effect.The worst could be over for Euro zone exporters, however.The biggest upward surge in the euro was in the second quarter last year when French President Emmanuel Macron was elected, and Q2 earnings will thus be compared with a higher euro base a year ago.In addition, the euro has fallen from its mid-February peak, suggesting the pressure could ease.Analysts at JP Morgan said while the U.S. is strongly outperforming Europe in terms of sales delivery in the first quarter, ""the worst of the Euro headwind happened in Q1, and in the second half positive sales surprises should shift from the U.S. to (the) Euro area."" Some investors were reluctant to make any bets on a reversal of the currency effect, however, arguing the euro alone could not be responsible for the extent of Europe's underperformance of the United States.""For us it's neither here nor there. Even net of any currency effects European markets have been a bit disappointing in the last year or so,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo, last year's winner in Baku and also in China two weekends ago, smashed into the back of team mate Max Verstappen in a lap 40 collision that ended the race for both of them.""It was quite an emotional race. Valtteri did an exceptional job and deserved to win, Sebastian also did a great job so it feels a bit odd to be up here,"" commented Hamilton on the podium. ""Definitely an untidy race for me.""The Briton had started on the front row for the first time since he took pole in the Australian season-opener but never looked like winning until Lady Luck removed both Vettel and Bottas from the equation.""It was such a crazy race, such an exciting race...to come out with a win, I feel incredibly grateful,"" said Hamilton, who went to commiserate with Bottas afterwards.ON A CLOUDSpaniard Carlos Sainz was fifth for  Renault  (PA:RENA) with Monegasque rookie Charles Leclerc sixth for Sauber, his first points in Formula One.""It felt like a win, I'm on a cloud now, it has been an amazing race,"" said Leclerc.New Zealander Brendon Hartley was also celebrating his first point after taking 10th for Toro Rosso.McLaren, who had their worst qualifying of the season on Saturday, ended up with a double points finish -- Fernando Alonso seventh and Stoffel Vandoorne ninth.Canadian teenager Lance Stroll, third in Baku last year, finished eighth to give struggling former champions Williams their first points of the year. Only 13 cars finished the race.While Vettel made a clean getaway, there was immediate carnage behind and the safety car was swiftly deployed.Raikkonen and Force India's Esteban Ocon collided, ending the Frenchman's race and sending a shower of debris across the track.Williams's Russian rookie Sergey Sirotkin ran into the back of Perez, who nudged Renault's Nico Hulkenberg into Alonso -- the Spaniard limping back to the pits on two tyres and rims.Hulkenberg then hit the wall on lap 11 while in fifth place, retiring, after he and Sainz had battled the Red Bulls.RAGING BULLSRicciardo and Verstappen could have collided several times before they eventually did, Ricciardo running into Verstappen while trying to pass at the first corner.Retired triple world champion Niki Lauda told reporters the blame lay 70 percent with Verstappen, whose season has been full of collisions, but Red Bull principal Christian Horner said they shared it equally.""They are both in the doghouse. They will apologise to all of the staff before Barcelona,"" he said. Stewards later reprimanded both drivers.The ensuing safety car played into Bottas's hands as the Finn had yet to pit. While it was out, with marshals cleaning up debris, Romain Grosjean crashed his Haas while warming his tyres.That kept the safety car out for even longer and when racing resumed Vettel passed Bottas but then ran wide as Hamilton and Raikkonen swept through.As Bottas headed for victory, he ran over a piece of debris that had been left behind and the race took yet another unexpected twist.""I'm absolutely heartbroken.

Anything can happen here and safety cars are very likely,"" said Vettel, who had struggled to break into the top 10 on Friday but led Saturday's final session.""The good point is that our car was really good this afternoon so it should be in a good place tomorrow,"" added the four times world champion after his 53rd career pole.""Yesterday I struggled a bit with confidence, with trust in the car and rhythm but today, when it clicks, it just keeps coming and it was really enjoyable.""Hamilton, also a four times champion but yet to win a race this season, lost time in the final sector and said it had been hard to keep the car straight in the crosswinds.Second on the grid was still his best start position since pole in the Australian season-opener, with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) sweeping the front row at the last two.""That was close. We did the best job we could,"" said Hamilton.""They were the quickest all weekend and they've obviously got a phenomenal car this year. But I'm really happy with the job the team did to get us from where we were yesterday to where we are today,"" said Hamilton.""We're in the mix. I will try to give Sebastian a hard time tomorrow.""RAIKKONEN ERRORRed Bull's 20-year-old Dutchman Max Verstappen starts fifth alongside Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who had looked like he could join Vettel on the front row for the third race in a row, and possibly beat him, but made a big mistake on his last lap.""It's a pity for Kimi because until the last corner he could have been on pole,"" said Ferrari principal Maurizio Arrivabene.The Force India pair of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Perez, who tangled in Baku last year in a clash that cost the team a likely podium, will line up together on the fourth row.Nico Hulkenberg qualified ninth for  Renault  (PA:RENA) but the tall German will collect a five place drop for an unscheduled gearbox change, lifting his Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz to that position instead.Canadian Lance Stroll, third in Baku last year, will start 10th for Williams -- the only team yet to score a point this season.There was early drama when the Toro Rosso cars of Frenchman Pierre Gasly and New Zealander Brendon Hartley nearly collided.Hartley was going slow due to a puncture, with Gasly swerving dramatically to avoid a huge collision and then driving down an escape road.""That is unacceptable,"" exclaimed the startled Frenchman over the team radio.""I was trying to get out of the way of Gasly, but I went the wrong way, sorry guys.

And it can happen, let’s be honest. So we need to plan accordingly.""Abiteboul said the team were treating Sainz as if he were staying, however.""We already actually started to work on next year’s car, we had a meeting this week with him to talk about the plan for next year, the objectives and also... the early concept of the 2019 car,"" he said.""It’s a clear sign we are not thinking that, in the back of our mind, he may not be with us. It may happen, but we don’t want to compromise short-term or middle-term performance by starting to mitigate the way we are working with him.""Sainz, who joined Renault late last season to replace Britain's under-performing Jolyon Palmer, has been out-qualified by team mate Nico Hulkenberg 3-0 this season and has only three points to the German's 22.Abiteboul recognized the youngster was ""a bit behind"" but said Renault remained fully supportive.""It would be completely inappropriate to start making judgments only after three races, way too early,"" he said. ""But it does say something about the quality of his team mate and that’s great, that’s only positive.""For the rest, we will see. We have a bit of time to specifically think about Carlos. Having said that, we will not delay the thinking process about the alternative in case it cannot work out with him.""It's my responsibility to make sure that we have a competitive lineup next year and to present the options to the board of Renault in the coming weeks and months and we will do that.""RICCIARDO DECISIONRed Bull have yet to decide whether to continue with Renault engines next season or switch to Honda.Abiteboul said that was unlikely to be the key factor in making up Ricciardo's mind, however, because power unit performance was converging.""The four engine manufacturers (Mercedes, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Renault and Honda) are very close from one another, particularly in race conditions,"" he added.""There is still a gap in qualifying, we know that, we are working around that on a number of areas. There will be some stuff coming hopefully later this season, I’m pretty sure that Honda are working on the same plan.""In my opinion, the gap (next year) will not be bigger from the gap we used to have from the previous set of regulations.""Red Bull must tell Renault what they are doing by the end of May, meaning Ricciardo will know the situation before he has to commit.The Australian, winner for Red Bull in China two weeks ago and in Azerbaijan last year, has spoken of his interest in joining Mercedes as team mate to four times world champion Lewis Hamilton.He has also been linked in the media to Ferrari but says he has so far talked only to his current team.Red Bull won four titles in a row with Renault V8 engines between 2010-13 but have been at loggerheads with the French manufacturer in the V6 turbo hybrid era and there is no 'wiggle room'.""Our engine will not be available for very long,"" said Abiteboul. ""We need to start making orders these days for next year. We have a number of long lead-time items in the engine... and we need to start now.""We are very clear with Red Bull that it cannot go past what's written in the regulations.

I will give everything. I will die in the car. I won’t hold back,"" he told Reuters ahead of Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix. ""I would put my life on (the line). Absolutely.""When you put your helmet on and you’re in the race, I find that’s just everything there is in the world,"" he continued. ""I love my family, and there’s so many things in life I enjoy, but when I’m in the car there’s nothing else that means anything.""For me, when I get in the car, the essential of life is Formula One.""Magnussen is one of those, like Ferrari's 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen -- whose admiration for the racers of yesteryear is undisguised.He is no lover of the 'halo' head protection device surrounding cockpits and made mandatory this season, as much for what it stands for as any aesthetic reasons.If the Dane is appreciative of the governing body for all their efforts to improve road safety for regular drivers, and he is, he also feels the track should be more about risk-taking and bravery than it is at present.

And now that’s not really a factor any more.""FRESH ENTHUSIASMMagnussen, whose father Jan raced in Formula One in the 1990s, has had a roller-coaster ride since his debut with McLaren in 2014.His second place in that year's Australian season-opener remains McLaren's highest placing since 2012, but he sat out 2015 before joining  Renault  (PA:RENA) in 2016 just when all hope seemed gone.That adventure lasted a season, with Renault signing Nico Hulkenberg and leaving the Dane battling Britain's Jolyon Palmer for the remaining seat. Magnussen jumped first and joined Haas.In Hungary last year he and Hulkenberg clashed, with the Dane forcing the German off.When Hulkenberg approached Magnussen afterwards to compliment him sarcastically on being ""once again the most unsporting driver"", the Dane's reply was not fit for a family audience.""I race hard,"" said Magnussen, when asked about that incident. ""In a situation like this with a midfield team, you’re not guaranteed to score points. And sometimes you have nothing to lose.""You might get a penalty, you might lose your front wing but there’s nothing to lose if you’re 11th. Go for it. Sometimes you have to be a lot more aggressive when you’re fighting out there.""If you are fighting for the championship, you have to play the long game. You have to change your approach. If I was fighting for the championship, you wouldn’t see me racing the same way.""This season, Magnussen is enjoying a continuity and security he has not had before. He feels appreciated and at one with his team. ""I really enjoy racing again, I don’t feel that kind of negative pressure, I don’t have that kind of bad feeling that I had, especially at McLaren,"" he said. ""I feel so much happier when I go to tracks and to the races. I’m really looking forward to it, like when I was a kid and I couldn’t sleep for a week before the race because I was so excited.""You went to the track with such a big energy and fighting spirit, that joy. And I’ve got that back now. I haven’t had that (feeling) in Formula One before.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

522,"Apr 27, 2018 04:45AM ET",French first-quarter growth slowdown tests ECB optimism,nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - French economic growth slowed slightly more than expected at the start of the year, official data showed on Friday, a day after the European Central Bank played down concerns of softness in the broader euro zone economy.The INSEE statistics agency said in a first estimate that the euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months - the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2016.That marked a slowdown from 0.7 percent growth recorded in the final three months of last year and was slightly below economists' average forecast for 0.4 percent in a Reuters poll.Slower business investment and exports in the face of a stronger euro were the main drags on the economy in the first quarter, a breakdown of the data showed.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the growth slowdown came as no surprise after the exceptionally strong end to 2017.""I think growth is solid in Europe and sustainable but we all know their are some clouds on the horizon,"" he said on the sidelines of a meeting with EU counterparts in Bulgaria, citing the risk of a trade war and interest rate increases.The European Central Bank sought to calm concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy on Thursday with sources telling Reuters policymakers were keen not to upset investors' expectations that its stimulus program would end this year.French inflation data offered ECB central bankers some relief on Friday, showing consumer prices rose the most in five and a half years in April to 1.8 percent, just below the ECB's 2.0 percent target. Weak inflation had been the main justification for the ECB's 2.55 trillion-euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus program.SOFT PATCHCapital Economics economist Jessica Hinds said that the slowdown was likely to prove a blip, forecasting the French economy would grow 2.3 percent this year and next after expanding 2.0 percent in 2017.""Granted, the activity surveys have softened since the start of the year. But they are still consistent with quarterly GDP growth of about 0.6 percent,"" Hinds said in a research note.""And investment is set to grow at a decent pace thanks to President (Emmanuel) Macron’s pro-business approach. Meanwhile, the continued improvement in the French labor market points to solid growth in consumer spending,"" she added.Consumer spending growth, traditionally the main motor of the French economy, grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter despite exceptionally cold temperatures boosting energy consumption in February.Meanwhile businesses slowed investment growth to 0.5 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous three months while overall production of goods and services slowed to only 0.3 percent from 0.9 percent.Manufacturing production fell particularly sharply, down 1.1 percent as companies such as carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and pharmaceutical group Sanofi (PA:SASY) said the euro's strength had hit their sales.As a result, exports swung from a sharp increase in the fourth quarter to a slight decrease in the first three months of 2018. Since imports were flat, foreign trade had no impact on overall growth, INSEE said.($1 = 0.8286 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Reuters confirmed the details independently.Goss was one of three top engineers at the team, along with aerodynamics head Peter Prodromou and chief engineering officer Matt Morris.McLaren said the review ""addresses a broad range of factors across the organization.""More details will be given in due course. Until that time there will be no further comment,"" they added.The once-dominant former champions have not won a race since 2012 and finished ninth overall of 10 teams last season, the last of a failed three-year partnership with Honda.During that time it was a widely-held belief at Woking that the team had one of the best chassis in the sport and was being held back by their under-performing and unreliable Japanese engine.McLaren switched to  Renault  (PA:RENA) power at the end of last year, the same engines that powered Red Bull to three wins in 2017, with Spain's double world champion Fernando Alonso not alone in having high expectations.The aim was to challenge Red Bull and return to the top three. While currently fourth in the championship, they are only three points ahead of Renault's factory team and 27 behind Red Bull, who triumphed in China two weeks ago with Australian Daniel Ricciardo.To rub salt in the wounds, Honda's engine has shown notable improvement with new partners Toro Rosso.French rookie Pierre Gasly finished in fourth place for the Red Bull-owned team in Bahrain this month, a better result than anything McLaren achieved in their three years with Honda.Although Alonso has scored more points in three races (22) than in all of last year (17), McLaren's best result so far in 2018 is a fifth place.Alonso, still regarded as one of the sport's fastest drivers, has also yet to qualify in the top 10 this season.McLaren announced a management shake-up earlier in April with Zak Brown appointed chief executive with overall responsibility for the team.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

525,"Apr 19, 2018 01:10PM ET",Peugeot boss faces toughest adversary yet in IG Metall,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Ilona WissenbachPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - PSA Group (PA:PEUP) boss Carlos Tavares, whose career has seen him thrash out margin-boosting labor deals for two carmakers in several countries, is now taking on Germany's IG Metall union, which has been the undoing of many a cost cutter.Under Tavares, a former  Renault  (PA:RENA) executive, the  Peugeot  maker is demanding pay curbs and other concessions from workers at Opel, the loss-making German carmaker it bought from General Motors (N:GM) last year, in return for new investment.The standoff could quickly take a political turn, amid reports PSA is also looking to shed thousands of jobs. Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened publicly on Wednesday, saying PSA must honor commitments made prior to the acquisition - when Tavares told German leaders there were no plans for plant closures or compulsory layoffs.""We expect above all that the company sticks to everything it promised in connection with the takeover,"" Merkel said at a summit of German state premiers, adding her government was seeking talks with PSA management.Western carmakers typically use plants in low-cost countries as benchmarks, warning higher-wage workers that failure to narrow the productivity gap could endanger their jobs.Pressure on manufacturing costs has increased with investment demands for connected, autonomous and electrified car development. GM is now employing similar tactics to seek concessions from its South Korean workforce.The U.S. carmaker failed to end Opel losses over two decades, hemmed in by German ""codetermination"" laws granting workers board seats and by IG Metall - which has thwarted or altered the plans of companies ranging from Volkswagen to Tesla.BLUFF CALLEDTensions have mounted at Opel since German workers called Tavares' bluff last week, by rejecting demands they waive the 4.3 percent pay increase negotiated by IG Metall nationwide.In response, PSA put investment plans on hold for the Eisenach plant in central Germany, tabling no new proposals. Unions fear the group may now begin planning to wind the plant down, triggering an all-out confrontation.Eisenach, which will lose Opel Corsa subcompact production after the model is updated next year, would have built the new Grandland SUV under the paused investment, sources have said.That plan would sustain only about half of the plant's workforce of 1,800, union representative Wolfgang Schaefer-Klug said after a works council meeting on Thursday.Opel could also cut 2,700-3,700 of the 7,700 jobs at its Ruesselsheim research center under scenarios discussed at the meeting, business magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported.PSA human resources chief Xavier Chereau had warned of ""consequences"" if IG Metall rebuffed management proposals, after other unions in Spain and Britain agreed concessions, according to a union source with knowledge of the talks.""We told him IG Metall is not like other unions,"" he said.FRENCH SQUEEZEIn Europe, French carmakers have led the squeeze on labor, extracting pay freezes and working time flexibility as investment recovered from the last major financial crisis.Renault, with Tavares as second-in-command, struck a deal with Spanish workers in November 2012. That in turn helped cajole French unions into signing a similar pact three months later. PSA, under then CEO Philippe Varin, followed suit.Such deals are part of the reason why PSA and Renault now regularly post automotive operating profit margins above 6 percent, compared with their 2-3 percent pre-crisis norms. By contrast, Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) namesake volume brand raised its margin to 4.1 percent last year from 1.8 percent.Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall lost 179 million euros ($221 million) for a negative 2.5 percent margin in the last five months of 2017, after PSA took control.The French carmaker has said it discovered the full extent of Opel's problems only once it had closed the acquisition - and months after giving assurances that no closures were necessary.""IG Metall wants to apply the same methods it always has, which cost Opel 20 years of losses and 50,000 jobs,"" said a source close to the French carmaker.The French group referred Reuters questions to Opel, which said it remained hopeful that ""codetermination-based dialogue"" would achieve a deal.""We want to pave the way for a sustainable future by unleashing investments based on the right level of competitiveness,"" a company spokesman said, adding it aimed to avoid ""forced redundancies"".IG Metall has a history of humbling foreign managers.Tesla (O:TSLA) became enmeshed in a German labor dispute soon after its 2016 acquisition of robotics specialist Grohmann, before eventually granting a 30 percent wage hike.In one of its earlier failed attempts to halt Opel losses, GM negotiated the closure of its Bochum plant, north of Cologne - but only at the price of job guarantees for remaining workers of the kind Tavares is now seeking to unpick.NO GUARANTEESStaying competitive offers the ""only guarantee"" of future sustainability for PSA workers and sites, the PSA boss is fond of saying.The group is so far refusing to renew the multi-year job and plant guarantees that typically accompany new production investments, according to sources on both sides of the talks, who asked not to be named. Current guarantees on jobs begin expiring this year, while Opel's plants are covered until 2020.""New guarantees are not on the table,"" said one. Management is now insisting the unions come back with proposed cuts to Christmas and holiday bonuses and other supplementary pay, to offset the basic wage increase they refused to suspend.Any PSA concessions on Eisenach would have likely repercussions for Opel's Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern plants and the rest of its 19,000 German workforce. It could also undermine labor agreement across the broader group.""We too have been through tough times and made considerable sacrifices for a competitiveness deal,"" said Franck Don, a French official with PSA's centrist CFTC union.""French workers wouldn't understand it if their Opel peers were not asked to make the same concessions they had to make. It would definitely create tensions in France.""During investor pitches, however, Tavares has placed heavy emphasis on Opel's German identity as a source of export growth potential - a stance that could be undermined by major cuts. IG Metall is confident he will give ground, rather than face prolonged German strikes that could further damage Opel's standing and performance, one union official said.""The brand can't afford to take any more scratches.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

At present taller drivers are at a weight disadvantage.MORE OVERTAKINGThe FIA said discussions would continue about aerodynamics, with the aim of taking a decision by the end of April once research carried out by the governing body with help from the teams had been concluded.Formula One's commercial rights holders Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA) want to see increased overtaking with more teams having a chance of winning races.The FIA also presented its proposed engine regulations for 2021, with current deals expiring at the end of 2020, and beyond.They were for a 1.6 liter V6 turbo hybrid engine, as is currently used, but without the MGU-H exhaust energy recovery system.The governing body said it would meet current and potential power unit manufacturers to discuss the proposals in more detail and hoped to reach an agreement by the end of May.Formula One currently has four engine providers -- champions Mercedes, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Honda -- but others such as Aston Martin have expressed an interest in coming in if the rules are right for them.Ferrari have warned, however, that they could walk away if they don't like what is on offer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I had no pace.""Vettel, who won the first two races of the season for Ferrari, saw his lead over Hamilton slashed from 17 points to nine.The German's race unravelled spectacularly, a collision with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen dropping him down the order, after the pre-race favorite had initially made a good start from pole and held the early lead.Verstappen had a 10 seconds penalty applied post-race for causing the collision, dropping the Dutch youngster from fourth to fifth. Vettel was also passed by the McLaren of Fernando Alonso two laps from the end.MINOR MIRACLERicciardo's mechanics had performed a minor miracle to change a blown engine after practice on Saturday, getting him out just in time during the first phase of qualifying.""Putting ourselves 24 hours ago, I thought we might be starting at the back of the grid,"" said the Australian. ""Today is the real reward for that work.""Sunday’s win was Ricciardo’s first since a chaotic Azerbaijan Grand Prix last June and it also broke Mercedes’ Shanghai stranglehold, with the champions having won the last six races there.Mercedes are yet to win this year, the first time since the turbo hybrid era started in 2014 that they have been beaten for three races in a row.Ricciardo and Verstappen were not early contenders but the deployment of the safety car on the 32nd of 56 laps, after the Toro Rosso pair Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley collided and left debris on track, swung the race Red Bull’s way.Bottas was in the lead at that stage ahead of Vettel, having overhauled the German during the pitstops, while Verstappen was fourth and Ricciardo sixth.Red Bull pulled both their cars into the pits, ‘double-stacking’ them and bolting a set of fresh soft tyres on each.The advantage of fresh tyres allowed Verstappen and Ricciardo to scythe through the field.""The safety car was so unlucky for us,"" exclaimed Bottas over the radio.Verstappen botched his chances of victory, and a possible one-two for Red Bull, with scrappy attempts to overtake the main title contenders.The Dutchman ran wide and dropped back behind Ricciardo when trying to pass Hamilton and later spun his Red Bull and Vettel’s Ferrari while attempting to pass the German for third -- an error he owned up to afterwards.Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg finished sixth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), ahead of Alonso whose aggressive overtaking move on Vettel was ‘noted’ by stewards.Spaniard Carlos Sainz was ninth for Renault with Kevin Magnussen rounding out the top 10 for Haas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Really enjoyed that one.""Raikkonen locked out the front row for Ferrari for the second time in succession.The Finn had led the timesheets as the drivers embarked on their final flying laps and appeared set to clinch pole position after going fastest in the opening two sectors.Vettel, who put in an error-strewn first attempt, then pulled out just enough through the final corners to deny the 38-year-old what would have been his first pole since last year’s Monaco Grand Prix.""It was okay but not good enough,"" said Raikkonen after the session. ""It wasn’t exactly what I wanted, but we’ll go tomorrow and see what we can do.""Bottas's time was more than half a second slower than Vettel's.Vettel has a 17-point lead over Hamilton after winning the opening two races of the season.The Briton, second in Australia and third in Bahrain, had gone into the weekend determined to claw back at least some of his deficit to the German at a track that Mercedes have dominated in recent years.The 33-year-old, like Vettel a four-times champion, has taken an unprecedented five wins in Shanghai but recognized that his chances of a sixth had taken a knock.""I don't know if we can challenge, we're half a second behind today,"" he said, hoping that expected warmer conditions on Sunday would help at a circuit where overtaking is easier than most.Red Bull’s Max Verstappen qualified fifth ahead of team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who made it out on track just in time, with the former champions working furiously to change his engine after it blew in the final practice session.Nico Hulkenberg was seventh for  Renault  (PA:RENA) ahead of Force India’s Sergio Perez.Carlos Sainz in the other Renault was ninth with Romain Grosjean rounding out the top 10 for Haas.There was more misery for former champions Williams, the only team yet to score a point after two races, who failed to make it through the first phase and had Canadian Lance Stroll 18th and Sergey Sirotkin 16th.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Finn duly picked up the baton to set the third quickest time but was 0.743 seconds off Vettel's pace.Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fourth.It was far from a trouble-free session for the former champions, with Australian Daniel Ricciardo sidelined by an blown power unit.Ricciardo ground to a halt a little over halfway through the session with the Tag Heuer-badged  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine in the back of his car belching smoke and fire.Kevin Magnussen was sixth for Haas, with the American outfit once again marking themselves out as the best-of-the-rest, ahead of Force India pair Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon.Carlos Sainz was ninth for Renault with Sergey Sirotkin an encouraging 10th for former champions Williams, who are enduring their worst start to a season since 2013 and are the only one of the 10 teams yet to score a point.Vettel, winner of the opening two races in Australia and Bahrain, currently leads Hamilton in the overall standings by 17 points.But the Briton, like Vettel a four-times champion, has won in Shanghai an unprecedented five times and is determined to claw back at least some of that deficit on Sunday.His Mercedes team have also started each of the last six Chinese Grands Prix from pole.Vettel will, however, go into qualifying later on Saturday as favorite to break the German marque's stranglehold and hand Ferrari only their second pole in China.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The 30-year-old last started from the front at last year's Mexican Grand Prix.""That was quite intense,"" said a relieved-looking Vettel, who ran wide over the kerbs at the final corner on his first run in the final qualifying phase.""First run in Q3, I was very happy and then I tossed it away in the last corner. Really happy that I got the second run and got it clean. ""I stayed away from that kerb in the last corner. The car was excellent all weekend so far.""Raikkonen gave Ferrari their first front-row lockout since last July's Hungarian Grand Prix. The Finn had looked a good bet for his first pole position since last year's Monaco Grand Prix after setting the pace on Friday's opening day of running and Saturday's final practice.He was on provisional pole as drivers embarked on their final runs but ran into traffic on his final flier.""Far from ideal in the last run with the traffic but what can I do?"" said the 2007 world champion.""Tomorrow is the main thing, that is the time when we get the points.""MIXED FORTUNESDaniel Ricciardo was fifth for Red Bull while his team mate Max Verstappen crashed in the opening part of qualifying, losing the car under acceleration out of the tight second corner.The Dutchman had already set a time good enough to progress to the second part of qualifying, however, and will start 15th.Frenchman Pierre Gasly was sixth in the Honda-powered Toro Rosso and Kevin Magnussen was seventh for Haas.Haas, who turned heads with their speed in the Australian season opener, could not quite repeat their dream qualifying result from Melbourne with Magnussen's team mate Romain Grosjean failing to make it past the opening 18 minutes of qualifying.Nico Hulkenberg was eighth for  Renault  (PA:RENA) ahead of Force India's Esteban Ocon and team mate Carlos Sainz.McLaren endured a disappointing qualifying with neither Fernando Alonso nor Stoffel Vandoorne making it through to the final top-10.Vettel snatched an opportunistic win for Ferrari in Melbourne two weeks ago, despite Mercedes clearly having the faster car.He heads into Sunday's race on course to become the first driver since Michael Schumacher in 2004 to open the season with consecutive wins for Ferrari.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

543,"Apr 07, 2018 10:01AM ET",Ferrari's Raikkonen tops the timesheets in final Bahrain GP practice,nan,"By Abhishek TakleMANAMA (Reuters) - Kimi Raikkonen set a scorching pace in Saturday’s final practice session to keep Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) at the top of the timesheets in the build-up to qualifying for Sunday's Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix.The Finn, who also ended opening day of practice quickest, lapped the 5.4-km Sakhir race track in a time of one minute 29.868 seconds, not far off his Friday benchmark.That put him a whopping 0.525 seconds clear of second-placed Max Verstappen, with his Red Bull team mate Daniel Ricciardo a further 0.059 seconds adrift in third.Raikkonen was the only driver to lap in the 1:29 bracket.Lewis Hamilton, who went into the weekend favorite for victory after having seen it snatched away by an ill-timed virtual safety car two weeks ago at the season-opener in Melbourne, was only fourth fastest, 0.823 seconds off Raikkonen’s best.His hopes of chalking up a third Bahrain win on Sunday have already taken a hit, with the Briton set to drop five places on the grid for an unscheduled gearbox change on his Mercedes.Sixth is the highest the four-times champion can start Sunday’s race -- which has never been won from lower than fourth on the grid -- even if he sets the quickest time in qualifying.Hamilton, nevertheless, remains on course to equal Raikkonen’s record of 27 consecutive finishes in the points on Sunday. Sebastian Vettel, winner in Australia and last year in Bahrain, was fifth quickest ahead of last year’s pole-sitter Valtteri Bottas who was sixth for Mercedes.Vettel caused a minor drama during the session when some of the bodywork fitted to his Ferrari’s sidepod worked loose and began flapping about, forcing the German four-time champion to pit for repairs.Nico Hulkenberg and Carlos Sainz put  Renault  (PA:RENA) best-of-the-rest with the seventh and eighth quickest times.Frenchman Pierre Gasly was ninth in his Honda-powered Toro Rosso with Fernando Alonso, a three-times winner in Bahrain, rounding out the top 10 in his McLaren.Ferrari can take encouragement from Raikkonen’s pace, with the Finn looking a strong bet for his first pole position since last year’s Monaco Grand Prix.The order at the front could change come qualifying, however, with the session taking place in much cooler track temperatures under the floodlights, compared to final practice, which was held in hot and sunny conditions.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Vettel snatched an opportunistic win from Hamilton in Formula One’s season opener in Australia two weeks ago, taking advantage of a timely virtual safety car to pit and stay ahead of the Briton who had led from pole.Hamilton's Mercedes was clearly fastest in Melbourne and the four-times champion arrived in Bahrain as favorite to make up the lost ground.His best effort on Friday was 0.655 seconds slower than Raikkonen, however, with at least some of that down to the 33-year-old running into traffic on his flying lap.Hamilton remains on course, though, to equal Raikkonen’s record of 27 consecutive finishes in the points.""It's been a normal Friday, we've got through all our program. It looks very close between all the teams and we definitely have got some work to do to try and see if we can eke out to be ahead of the others,"" said Hamilton.Max Verstappen ended the day fifth fastest ahead of Red Bull team mate Daniel Ricciardo. The former champions had book-ended the timesheets in the afternoon, with Ricciardo fastest and Verstappen at the bottom having failed to set a time after being sidelined by an electrical issue.The Dutchman got out and helped marshals push the car back to the pitlane.Nico Hulkenberg was seventh fastest in the  Renault  (PA:RENA) ahead of Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly while McLaren pair Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne rounded out the top 10.Friday’s two 90-minute sessions were relatively uneventful although Bottas, on a slow lap, almost collided with Ricciardo who was going quickly.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Toro Rosso had looked quick and reliable in pre-season testing in Spain, raising hopes that the Honda engine would be more competitive in their new start with the Red Bull-owned Italian team.Honda's performance is also being closely monitored by former world champions Red Bull racing, who have yet to decide what engines to use after 2018 and are currently using  Renault  (PA:RENA) units with Tag Heuer branding.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

547,"Apr 04, 2018 07:57AM ET","In boost for Britain, Peugeot to build new van at Vauxhall plant",nan,"By Costas PitasLUTON, England (Reuters) - Peugeot-maker PSA (PA:PEUP) has unveiled plans to raise output at its British Vauxhall van plant, in a pre-Brexit show of confidence that will raise pressure on sister brand Opel's German workforce to offer concessions in labor talks.PSA, which last year acquired Opel/Vauxhall from General Motors (N:GM), will build  Peugeot  and Citroen models as well as the next Vauxhall Vivaro van in Luton, north of London. Production will rise to 100,000 vehicles from 60,000 in 2017.The French group, which is locked in labor talks with Opel's German workers, said the Luton investment was helped by ""responsible social dialogue with the Unite union guaranteeing production flexibility"", as well as UK government support.The union said 350-400 jobs would be created as a result of the investment, which PSA said would amount to about 100 million euros ($123 million). Around 1,400 people are currently employed at the site, which is Britain's only van plant.The announcement is a boost to Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of talks to decide Britain's long-term trading relationship with the European Union, although PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares underscored the need for free trade.""I take on board the assurances that the UK government have provided us on seeking tariff-free and frictionless trade with the EU going forward,"" he said at the plant on Wednesday.""There is still work to do to ensure frictionless trade.""The Vivaro, which currently shares underpinnings with  Renault 's (PA:RENA) Trafic van, will in future be assembled on PSA's EMP2 vehicle platform.That will allow production of the Peugeot Expert and Citroen Jumpy to be introduced in Luton, the group said, confirming an earlier Reuters report.After rescuing PSA from near-bankruptcy in 2013, Tavares is negotiating new union deals for Opel/Vauxhall as he pursues an ambitious restructuring plan designed to restore the division's profitability by 2020.Raising pressure on Germany's IG Metall union, the division's German CEO Michael Lohscheller underlined that new deals had now been struck with workers in Britain, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Poland, allowing investment in their sites.The latest UK investment safeguards the Luton plant's future for ""many years to come"", Lohscheller said on Wednesday.PSA said it needed to boost van output to meet growing demand but could wait until 2020 to decide on future car production at its Ellesmere Port factory in northwest England, where the run of its current Astra Sports model does not end until the next decade.The British government is contributing 9 million pounds to the van investment as part of its push to support the UK automotive industry, which employs over 800,000 people and generates revenue of 77.5 billion pounds ($110 billion)."
548,"Apr 04, 2018 05:11AM ET",Motor racing: Hamilton chasing maximum points and another record,nan,"By Abhishek Takle(Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton will be out to secure maximum points, and equal a Formula One record, in Bahrain on Sunday after victory was plucked from his grasp in the Australian season-opener.Mercedes' four times world champion has scored in his last 26 races, one short of Kimi Raikkonen’s unprecedented run of 27 with Lotus in 2012-13, and stood on the podium in 19 of them.The 33-year-old Briton, who last drew a blank when he retired with a blown engine while leading the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix, will also be looking to make a statement as he moves on from Melbourne.Hamilton was on his way to a comfortable win from pole position at Albert Park when an ill-timed virtual safety car and a computer bug threw Mercedes’ strategy predictions off and handed victory to Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) rival Sebastian Vettel instead.""It feels like a dark cloud but it’s not,"" he told reporters after finishing second. ""We have a great car, we are still the world champions and with a couple of adjustments we can win the next race.""Hamilton has taken two of Mercedes's three wins from the last four years in Bahrain but Vettel and Ferrari broke the stranglehold last year when Bahrain followed China as third round of the season.Mercedes are expecting another thriller under the floodlights.""We saw in Melbourne that the Ferraris in particular were very quick, so I expect it to be a close battle,"" commented team boss Toto Wolff.The circuit’s four long straights could allow Ferrari to edge closer but Vettel -- set to start his 200th race -- may need another dose of luck to celebrate an unprecedented fourth win in Bahrain.Ferrari will also have to watch out for Red Bull, whose Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo set the fastest lap in Melbourne and piled the pressure on Raikkonen in his bid for a home podium.""The track is one that I’ve always done well on,” said Ricciardo, whose lowest finish in Bahrain since he stepped up to Red Bull in 2014 is sixth. ""So let’s hope it continues to be good to me.""Sunday will also set the stage for another hard-fought midfield battle.McLaren, who have Bahrain’s Mumtalakat Holding Company as major shareholders, will hope to win that one after ending their first race with new engine partners  Renault  (PA:RENA) solidly in the points.But they will have to overcome a Haas team whose Ferrari-powered car drew intense scrutiny after they stunned rivals with their pace in the opener.The U.S.-owned team will be hoping to put behind them the disappointment of having both drivers retire in Melbourne after botched pitstops while on course for a best-ever result.Off the track, the big story will be a presentation to teams by commercial rights holder Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA) and governing FIA of how they see the future unfolding after current agreements expire at the end of 2020.New engine regulations are a key part of that, with the focus also on Ferrari after the Italian team threatened to walk away from Formula One if they do not like what is being proposed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The hardest thing is getting used to pitstops and strategy because neither George or I have done any of that before. But in terms of just driving the car, it comes quite naturally and quite quickly.""I think we’ll be up there...I don’t see any reason why we can’t win.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose 1.6 to 3.3 percent. Cyclical industrials, autos, and banking stocks drove the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.2 percent. The index was still set for its worst quarter in two years, however, suffering a 5 percent decline. Starting with a stellar rally in global equities in January, this quarter developed into a challenging one for stock markets with investors navigating a sharp spike in volatility, rumbling trade tensions and anxiety over the tech sector.In Europe, slowing macroeconomic indicators have been taken as a ""sell"" signal for the region's equities, which had enjoyed a lift most of last year as a narrative of stronger economic growth took hold. ""Support from attractive valuations and fading FX headwinds is not enough to override the signal from relative macro surprises,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) equity analysts, reaffirming their underweight position on European equities versus the U.S.M&A news was the main driver on Thursday.Besides Renault,  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) was also a top gainer, up 2.3 percent after a report that Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984), which has been in deal talks with the reinsurance firm, is looking to buy a 25 percent stake. [L8N1RB1CB]Meanwhile services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) sank 15 percent after cutting its full-year sales and profit margin outlook, reporting a weaker than expected second quarter.""Given management guidance, we see potential for consensus EBIT downgrades of over 10 percent and material share price pressures, near term,"" said UBS analysts.Peers  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) and  Compass Group  (L:CPG) also declined 2.2 to 2.4 percent, making the travel and leisure sector (SXTP) the worst-performing. While cyclicals were ruling the roost on Thursday, defensive sectors have enjoyed something of a revival in recent weeks as investors rushed to the areas of the market traditionally seen as safer, with stable earnings and high dividends.""Should concerns about a trade war escalate, defensive stocks would likely outperform ... We would be wary of cyclicals, in particular international ones,"" wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.Positioning on cyclicals is elevated,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts found. Both European and global funds have increased their cyclicals exposure to near the highest levels in the last decade, adding especially to financials, tech and industrials.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That compared with sales of over 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighboring India, which has a population of 1.3 billion.""There's a big population and the level of (car ownership) is low. It's a good-sized market which is growing,"" said Peyman Kargar, a senior vice president at Nissan who heads operations in Africa, the Middle East and India, adding that the country's annual sales were likely to grow to 300,000 by 2022.The Ghandhara Nissan plant, which has an annual capacity of 6,000 vehicles, would produce ""several (Datsun) models based on the same platform to optimize the investment"", Kargar said, declining to name specific models.In neighboring India, Nissan markets its Datsun Go series of compact hatchbacks and people-carriers, while it launched its new Cross compact crossover sport utility vehicle (SUV) in Indonesia earlier this year.It will contribute technical assistance in the upgrade, while the automaker will also assess and assist local components makers in supplying parts. Kargar said he hoped local parts would initially comprise around 20 percent of vehicles, increasing afterwards. Comprising 6 percent of global sales, Africa, the Middle East and India is a growth area for Nissan, and Kargar said he expected to double the region's contribution to overall sales by 2022.Nissan's bet on Datsun to succeed in Pakistan comes as increasing sales of the entry-level brand has been a bright spot in India, a highly competitive market where the automaker's market share has eased to around 1.6 percent due to sluggish demand for its marquee Sunny sedan and its SUVs. In the 11 months to February, Nissan posted an 8 percent fall in overall Indian vehicle sales.($1 = 115.3800 Pakistani rupees)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The regional STOXX 600 benchmark (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent to its lowest level since February 2017, having earlier gained as much as 0.6 percent following reports the United States and China had quietly started negotiations to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets. ""Exemptions on steel/aluminium tariffs have already been granted for other important trade partners, which suggests the U.S. president is using this approach more for negotiating leverage rather than any real intention to start a global trade war"", said Accendo Markets head of research Mike van Dulken. He noted that China's response so far was ""measured"" and ""nuanced"".European equity markets however slipped into negative territory as the euro gained further strength. Traders said sentiment was also dented by growing diplomatic tensions between Western countries and Russia.""Despite a bright opening in the U.S. with Wall Street seeing early gains of over 1.5 percent, increased geopolitical tensions with Russia ensured that volatility was alive and kicking,"" said Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index. The United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain that they have blamed on Moscow.A sales trader at a European brokerage however said he did not see how these tensions could have any big impact on global economic growth.Stocks exposed to Russia were mixed.

""It must have been a software bug in the system that caused us to get it wrong. We are digging deep now to understand where we had a problem.""STILL BEMUSEDHamilton, who cockily spoke of ""wiping the smile off"" Vettel's face with his pole lap on Saturday, battled to keep positive.""Even now I don't understand what's happened,"" the 33-year-old told reporters. ""I did everything I believe I was supposed to do.""After the pit-lane setback, Hamilton drove hard to reel in Vettel and battled back after taking a slide at a corner that blew out the lead to nearly three seconds.But he finally waved the white flag in the closing laps to preserve the car for future races.Twice world champion Fernando Alonso finished fifth for McLaren in the team's first race with  Renault  (PA:RENA) power, equalling their best result in three dreary years with previous engine suppliers Honda.Red Bull's Dutch wunderkind Max Verstappen finished sixth after suffering a full 360-degree spin on the 10th lap that put him out of the running.Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas finished eighth after starting 15th, having taken a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change after a heavy crash during qualifying. A weekend that begun brightly for Haas with a strong qualifying turned sour during the race when Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen ground to a halt in quick succession before the halfway mark.The team was fined 10,000 euros ($12,000) by stewards after it emerged they had failed to secure wheels properly on both cars during botched tyre-changes when pitted.They were among five cars that failed to finish the eventful opener, including Williams' Russian debutant Sergey Sirotkin who blamed a rogue plastic sandwich bag for destroying the car's brakes.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

IMPROVED HAASThe Briton's brilliance was not matched by team mate Valtteri Bottas, who crashed early in the final shootout.The Finn, who had complained of balance problems during Q1, spun out at turn two and smashed hard into a barrier, leaving his wrecked car and debris scattered all over the track.The red flag was waved as the television broadcast showed Mercedes boss Toto Wolff bowing his head in disappointment back in the team garage.Bottas, who will start in 10th, passed a medical check but it remains unclear how much of his car is salvageable.Haas confirmed themselves as the big improvers after positive winter testing, with drivers Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean locking down the third row.Renault's Nico Hulkenberg took a spin into the gravel in Q2 but scraped through to the final session and will start seventh, his team mate Carlos Sainz two places behind.McLaren's hopes of a quick return to the top four with their new  Renault  (PA:RENA) engines proved overly ambitious, with twice champion Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne shut out of the final session.Force India, fourth in the constructors' championship for the last two years, also have work to do after being knocked out during Q2.The championship's debutant drivers had an underwhelming session, with Sauber's Charles Leclerc and Williams' driver Sergey Sirotkin eliminated early.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

560,"Mar 23, 2018 04:13AM ET",Nissan says aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2022,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) announced plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles (EVs) annually by 2022 and said it would focus its lower-emissions lineup on all-battery and gasoline-hybrid EVs rather than costlier technologies including plug-in hybrids.Nissan and its rivals are planning to crank up development and production of electric cars in response to tightening emissions regulations around the world, even as demand for such vehicles remains limited due to their high cost and limited charging infrastructure.The Japanese automaker said on Friday it would develop eight new all-battery EVs over the next four years, including four models for China, where it is planning to expand. Its luxury Infiniti brand would begin carrying new electric models from 2021, it added.Through 2022, vehicles powered by its ""e-power"" gasoline-hybrid technology would likely comprise the majority of Nissan's electric line-up through 2022, it said. Such vehicles use gasoline to power the car's motor, requiring a much smaller battery than EVs and therefore are less expensive to produce. ""The heart of our strategy in terms of electrification is battery EVs and e-Power technology,"" Nissan Chief Planning Officer Philippe Klein told reporters at a briefing. He did not disclose Nissan's planned investment in developing the new EVs.Nissan and its automaking partners, France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), together plan to launch 17 electric models as part of their strategy to achieve annual vehicle sales totaling 14 million units by 2022, compared with 10.6 million units in 2017.Klein added that road tests for the automaker's self-driving vehicle followed the ""highest safety levels possible"", and that Nissan had no plans to stop testing its technology, following a fatal accident involving a self-driving car operated by Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] in the United States earlier this week.Global automakers and technology companies are facing mounting pressure to prove that their automated driving functions under development are safe to use on public roads in light of the accident.Nissan and mobile gaming operator DeNA Co (T:2432) earlier this month held public field tests of their Easy Ride self-driving taxi service in Yokohama. They plan to offer the service beginning in Japan in the early 2020s.The automaker is also planning to equip 20 of its models, mostly in developed markets, with automated driving functions including self-driving capabilities on city roads by 2022. As part of their mid-term strategy through 2022, Nissan and its automaking partners Renault and Mitsubishi Motors plan to launch a total of 40 vehicles with autonomous drive (AD) technology and become an operator of self-driving, ride-hailing services.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The striking papaya orange and blue MCL33 is the team's first to be powered by Renault, whose engines took Red Bull to three race wins last season.TOP FOUR TARGETSince crossing to McLaren, Alonso has been stuck on 97 podium finishes, his last with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2014.He was bullish about his chances of reaching the milestone 100th podium during the coming season and felt the team should also have big ambitions in the constructors' championship.""I think so.

Yes it does,"" team boss Toto Wolff told reporters.""We’ve seen that with the successes from Ferrari in the years 2000 and Red Bull a couple of years ago...""I think the most healthy situation for Formula One is a very competitive environment where multiple teams are able to win, the championship goes down to the wire...these are clearly the ingredients it needs.""That could also happen, if predictions of a tight three-way tussle at the top come true, and Hamilton for one would welcome the challenge.MAX ATTACKExactly who stands where will likely remain unclear until well after Melbourne, which is not always the best guide to long-term form.

Malaysia has gone.Off track, Liberty and the governing FIA face tricky talks about the future direction of the sport, and what kind of engine to use from 2021, with Ferrari threatening to walk away if they do not like what is on offer.And then there is the 'halo', the head protection device that has changed the look of the cars and makes its race debut with drivers already largely accustomed to it.By the time the championship is won, it may be less of a talking point than Fangio.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But this season could see movement.The Mexican, who scored points in 17 of last season's 20 races, has been linked to Ferrari in the past even if others may now be ahead of him in the queue to replace 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen.The driver market is braced for a big shake-up, with 38-year-old Raikkonen out of contract at year end along with Finland's Valtteri Bottas at champions Mercedes and Australian Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull.Ricciardo will set the ball rolling if he moves, with Renault's young Spaniard Carlos Sainz only on loan from Red Bull pending the Australian's decision.VERY INTENSEPerez, who took two second places and a third with Sauber in 2012 and has taken more podiums (four) with Force India than any driver, will look to impress but faces a stiff challenge from 21-year-old team mate Esteban Ocon.The two clashed last year, missing out on a podium in Azerbaijan after a collision that led Force India to impose rules of engagement. Relations are now much better.""I think we definitely had very intense moments in the team and thankfully everything changed for the good of the team, for the benefit of us,"" said Perez.""Now we work well together, in the last races, and I really hope that trend continues. We have to work together, we have to be united to push the team forward and hopefully battle each other for good positions.""The Mexican said everything felt more natural going into his eighth season. ""You are more patient, you know what you need from yourself, how you have to prepare yourself, but every year you learn every single weekend. I learnt so much last year,"" he said.

I think there should be no worries that this will continue. I don’t want it to happen.""The two -- equally determined and well-matched on the track with plenty of ambition -- will still form one of the more competitive pairings in the sport and there is always the possibility for friction.Asked this month whether the fourth-ranked team would be reminding them of their responsibilities this season, chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer did not hesitate:""Yes. Daily, if not hourly,"" he replied.""We’re going to start off the season as we left it last year,"" continued the American. ""The last few races they were allowed to compete against each other.""One of the phases of team building is the conflict stage. And then when you get past the conflict stage, you work better together. I think that’s the stage they’re at now.""CHANGE OF ATTITUDEOcon said he and 28-year-old Perez, now the only Latin American driver on the starting grid after Brazilian Felipe Massa's retirement, actually got on well enough.""We would probably never go on holidays together, but we have no problem,"" declared the Frenchman, who is of Spanish extraction.""There is a great atmosphere in the team, everyone’s working closely and I work closely with him as well so there are no issues.""Perez said last year that Ocon needed to change his attitude and he felt that had happened.""Esteban is one of the best drivers out there in terms of his capacity. What he did last year with not a lot of experience was quite impressive,"" the Mexican told Reuters.""Everyone realized and spoke very highly about him, and that’s good.""I could see that towards the end of the year he’s a different person, the way he approached things. I hope that just keeps getting better on him.""Ocon has plenty at stake this year, as a Mercedes-backed driver placed with customer team Force India to get experience while the world champions decide their next move.If he continues to shine, and Valtteri Bottas fails to convince as four times world champion Lewis Hamilton's team mate, then Ocon could be next in line for one of the most coveted seats.""My career is managed by Mercedes so it would be the logical way to go at some point in Mercedes but I fully trust my management side, they will decide on my future,"" he said, diplomatically.There is also a home grand prix to look forward to at Le Castellet -- the southern circuit where he took his first single-seater podium and victory in Formula  Renault  (PA:RENA) 2.0 in 2012 and 2013 respectively.Ocon said a new fitness regime, involving tramping through deep snowdrifts in the Pyrenees mountains during European winter training, had also paid off.""Basically what I saw from last year was that we also could improve on my training regime.

Probably a couple of years ago maybe I didn’t have the knowledge of all of the areas,"" he said.""So I thought now was the time to do it and I feel ready. I think in terms of mental approach it’s going to be not an issue because every time you jump in the car you want to be competitive.""Physically, while driving it’s going to be OK."" MCLAREN FIRSTMcLaren executive director Zak Brown said Alonso was the kind of person who would be racing something during his down time anyway.He also pointed out that while the WEC 'Super Season' ran to eight events, only five were this year with the rest in 2019 and ending at a second Le Mans. And one of the five was during the August break.""What a lot people don’t know is he’s karting every weekend,"" added the American.""If he wasn’t going to be in a prototype, he would have been in a kart or something else. I’ve never seen someone who wants to literally live in a race car like he does... I just think if he’s at a grocery store it would be ‘let’s race the karts’.""Alonso will not be doing anything more than drive for Toyota and WEC organizers have bent over backwards to fit in, to the extent of moving the Fuji Six Hours to avoid a clash with the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin.If there are any conflicts, McLaren come first. ""He’s a McLaren driver on loan for those weekends,"" said Brown, who was a key figure in Alonso's headline-grabbing Indianapolis bid.""His responsibilities there are pretty much driving, so he’s not going to have the same level of promotional work, sponsor commitments that would normally come along with that (involvement).""And he’s well studied and focused on what preparation takes.

Another season of disappointment would be more than fans could bear. ""There’s no hiding,"" executive director Zak Brown had said before the car took to the track for the first time, recognizing that McLaren would be in the spotlight, and those words apply now more than ever.""But this team has won lots of world championships so we’re up for it,"" he added.The past five years do not make happy reading for the sport's second most successful team, who finished ninth out of 10 in 2017 with a meager 30 points -- 638 fewer than champions Mercedes.An outfit with 182 grand prix victories to their credit, and the team of champions such as Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton, have not won a race since the end of 2012.McLaren's 12th and last driver's title was provided by Hamilton nearly a decade ago, in 2008, and they have yet to win a constructors' crown in this millennium.NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY WRONGMcLaren lost track time to technical issues on five of the eight days of testing, with a sixth virtually wiped out by snow.Turbo trouble and an engine change on the final day at the Circuit de Catalunya cost Alonso five hours of running, but he then returned to pump out the second fastest time of the day.""It is a new partnership with Renault -- new packaging, completely new packaging for the car as well. This is testing, give us time. It is fine,"" racing director Eric Boullier had said in response to earlier issues.""There will be a few glitches but we haven't lost our ability to design fast cars.""The sight of a stricken car returning to the pits on a recovery truck will soon be forgotten if McLaren come good in Australia and beyond, however.""There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the car,"" said Alonso.""The issues we have had are under control. Unfortunately we keep discovering small things but that is making us in a strong position for Australia because we are strengthening all the small things.""McLaren's papaya orange and blue car has caught the eye also for the large expanses of bodywork unadorned by sponsor logos, and a return to form would help fill them.A top three finish will be a big challenge, with Mercedes, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Red Bull taking all but one podium place between them in last season's 20 races.But Red Bull have the same engine as McLaren, who boasted last year that they had one of the best chassis on the grid, and will be a benchmark.So too will Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso, who have been pounding out laps and respectable times with what now looks like a surprisingly reliable Honda engine.The possibility that Honda may have come good at last will be hard for the fans to swallow if McLaren fail to live up to expectations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

574,"Mar 08, 2018 10:10PM ET",Ola's sputtering India electric vehicle trial a red flag for Modi plan,nan,"By Aditi ShahNAGPUR, India (Reuters) - Indian ride-hailing firm Ola's pilot project to test a fleet of electric vehicles in the western city of Nagpur was expected to herald a coming revolution in the Indian autos industry. So far, though, it has only exposed fractures in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitions to make all new vehicles electric by 2030.With an initial investment of about $8 million, Softbank-backed Ola launched the project last year at an event that had all the trappings of a state function, including a big gathering and flagging off by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.But nine months later, the program has hit a snag: Ola drivers, unhappy with long wait times at charging stations and high operating expenses, want to return their cars and switch to fuel-guzzling variants.Out of 20 Ola electric car drivers interviewed by Reuters in Nagpur, more than a dozen said they have either returned their electric taxis and switched to diesel, or are planning to do so. Ola had said it would make 50 charging points available across four locations in Nagpur - a city of about 2.5 million people - for its fleet of 200 electric vehicles, but on a visit to the city in late January, Reuters found only about a dozen charging points. Ola has since added 10 additional charging points but is still short of its target. Ola did not respond to requests for comment for this article.Getting infrastructure built in the world's biggest democracy where a not-in-my-backyard culture proliferates is a barrier for a lot of businesses in India. And it is proving to be the same for charging stations - Ola was forced to close one in Nagpur last year after protests by residents angered by traffic jams caused by drivers. It took more than five months to get government clearances to begin operating another station.The hurdles faced by Ola in setting up sufficient charging stations for a fleet of expensive electric cars with a limited driving range expose the challenges the Indian government and automakers will face if they are to get anywhere near realizing the 2030 vision.REPEATEDLY WARNED Global auto makers have repeatedly warned that India is not ready for electrification, saying the government must first lay down a clear, long-term policy, provide incentives to encourage manufacturing of electric vehicles to bring down their cost and create the charging infrastructure. Gadkari added to uncertainty when he said last month that the government will no longer draft a separate electric vehicle policy. He did not comment on the 2030 vision.The Ola project has not turned out to be economically viable for either the company or its drivers, said one industry source familiar with Ola's strategy.""The project's not flying as of now and the economics is not working out,"" the source said.Electric car sales in India, one of the world's fastest-growing auto markets, made up less than 0.1 percent of annual sales of more than 3 million passenger cars. The lack of demand is mainly because they are expensive - due to high battery costs - and as their range is limited and there isn't a charging infrastructure.By comparison, in China in 2017, electric vehicles made up about 2 percent of annual passenger car sales of 24.7 million.The Indian government had been determined to promote electric vehicle use, starting with public transport and taxis, to combat rising pollution and reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil.India's 2030 ambition was part of a broader move by countries like China and the United Kingdom, which have set similar goals. This has spurred billions of dollars in investments by carmakers like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) even as many in the industry say they are unsure who will buy the massive numbers of electric vehicles governments want them to produce. MAGNITUDE OF CHALLENGESMahindra & Mahindra is the only electric carmaker in India and the high cost of even its entry-level model, which starts at 760,000 rupees ($11,665) is a barrier for many first-time car buyers, and a non-starter for taxi drivers who can get a diesel or gasoline propelled car for about half the price.Ola has deep pockets and while it has tied-up with Mahindra for the pilot project, its struggle to make the fleet viable in a small Indian city with much less congestion and space constraints than the biggest cities like Mumbai, underscores the magnitude of the challenges.A shortage of stations and the limited range of cars - about 100 kilometers - has meant longer queues to recharge. During summer months when batteries discharge faster and need to be recharged more, the situation may worsen unless more charging points are added, said several drivers, none of whom wanted to be named as they feared retribution from the company.The cars are owned by Ola and leased to drivers for 1,000 rupees a day, but many complain that the amount is too high and they need to work for 12-16 hours to make a decent living, given they waste 3-4 hours a day on charging.One of the drivers said that after paying Ola the rent for the car and shelling out 500-600 rupees per day for charging, he is left with about 500 rupees ($7.71) at the end of a 14-hour day giving him little time to rest or spend with his family.""If they don't give us the (charging) facility, why should we drive these cars,"" said the driver, who had just spent an hour waiting for his turn to charge the car, and would have to wait for another 90 minutes while it charges.Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal told Reuters last April that the company would pilot a few thousand electric vehicles in several Indian cities in 2017 and then scale up in a major way. However, almost a year later it has still to take the experiment beyond Nagpur.HUGE RISKSAt India's biennial auto show in February, electric cars took center stage but most were at a concept stage or sold only in global markets as automakers like Toyota, Honda and  Renault  (PA:RENA) took a circumspect approach to the new tilt toward electrification. ""Once we make an investment there are huge risks,"" said Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota's India arm, adding as of now there is no clarity on who would buy such cars and what incentives the government will offer.Charging infrastructure is a big piece of the puzzle that needs to be resolved for EVs to be viable - India has only about 222 charging stations with 353 charging points, according to a January report by global consultancy EY. Analysts estimate it costs between $500 and $25,000 to set up a station, and that comes on top of expensive land purchases needed to build them. The ministry of heavy industries estimates a subsidy worth 140 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) will be needed to promote EVs and charging infrastructure.Automakers argue in the near-term the government should make land available and invest in building stations, while over the longer-term it would need to offer incentives to private investors.One additional problem is that, unlike in Western countries, most car owners in India do not have garages, or formal parking where chargers for cars could be installed.Another issue is lack of a long-term policy, outlining incentives, which has helped countries like China push electric vehicle sales. Government wrangling over policy formulation in India is making it difficult for carmakers to plan investments.""Any distraction from the single-minded focus to draw a plan for introducing electric vehicles is going to make this a long-lasting exercise that might not attract the attention of the right kind of investors,"" cautions Guenter Butschek, managing director at Tata Motors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

580,"Mar 07, 2018 01:20PM ET",Exclusive: Nissan in talks to buy France's Renault stake in merger prelude,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Arno Schuetze and Laurence FrostLONDON/FRANKFURT/GENEVA (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) and alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) are discussing plans for a closer tie-up in which the Japanese carmaker would acquire the bulk of the French state's 15 percent Renault holding, people close to the matter told Reuters.The carmakers are in talks with government officials over proposals by Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn that would see Paris give up influence at Renault and the French carmaker relinquish control over Nissan, according to three sources.But any deal still faces significant hurdles - not least its extreme political sensitivity in France - and has yet to win government approval, they said. To do so, it must balance French and Japanese interests, avoiding the appearance of a takeover.""Any discussion about a share transaction involving Renault, Nissan or the French state is pure speculation,"" Renault-Nissan spokesman Jonathan Adashek said. The alliance ""has no plans to change the cross-shareholding ratio of its member companies"", he added.An official at the French finance ministry said the government ""totally denied"" it was ready to sell its Renault shares to Nissan. The sources said Renault was being advised by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Nissan by Nomura on the planned stake sale, which would happen either as part of a broader Renault-Nissan combination or as a ""stepping stone"" on the way to one. The banks did not respond to requests for comment.Ghosn has also proposed an interim structure that would see management of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) overseen by a Dutch foundation as a prelude to their integration as a global automotive group based in Amsterdam, sources said.""For the government, a Dutch foundation is not an option,"" said the finance ministry official, who declined to be named. Renault shares closed up around 5.6 percent at 94.44 euros.The Renault-Nissan alliance, underpinned by cross-shareholdings, has wrestled intermittently since its 1999 inception with plans for full mergers that have foundered on objections from France, Renault's biggest shareholder.But with Ghosn, the alliance's main architect, now beginning his final term as Renault CEO, the government has been pressing for a tie-up to secure the future of Renault-Nissan, the world's largest carmaking group by sales last year.President Emmanuel Macron's government recently told Ghosn's representatives it would be ready to exit or sell down its Renault holding as part of a merger deal that secured French interests, according to multiple sources close to the talks.Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan but agreed to limit formal control of its larger partner in a 2015 shareholder pact that defused a boardroom standoff with the French government. Nissan currently owns a 34 percent controlling stake in Mitsubishi and 15 percent of Renault, but no voting rights.Under Tokyo market rules, Renault would lose all voting rights on its Nissan holding if the Japanese carmaker raised its Renault stake to 25 percent or more.Any move by France to sell most or all of its Renault stake could prove politically risky for Macron, already under fire for letting national champions such as TGV train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) fall into foreign hands.Beyond its dilution and loss of influence, France remains concerned about the impact on technology centers, industrial jobs and tax revenues from a combined group headquartered elsewhere, the sources said.To win acceptance, they added, the deal would need to include powerful concessions and guarantees to France, in areas such as jobs and investment, board representation and possible ""golden share"" veto rights over major strategic decisions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Ideally we want a win-win alliance. Handing Volvo and Geely our Mercedes technology is not win-win,"" one Mercedes-Benz executive, who declined to be named, told Reuters.Geely's proposal poses a further challenge to the Germans, because Mercedes-Benz, which has expertise in self-driving cars, connected vehicle and electrification technology, already has an alliance with Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7211). It also has a deal to build conventional and electric cars in China with existing joint-venture partner BAIC Motor Corporation (HK:1958).Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche cautiously welcomed his new shareholder at the Geneva show, expressing admiration for Li and Geely, but said any alliance would depend on keeping BAIC happy. ""We will examine everything if it is in keeping with the wishes of our partner,"" Zetsche told reporters. Geely's ownership of a stake in Volvo trucks, a direct competitor to Daimler's trucks business, makes cooperation particularly difficult in the area of commercial vehicles, Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters.""In the truck business, Daimler and Volvo are really heads on competitors, maybe in a more sharper way than we are with Daimler,"" Samuelsson said. ""It is difficult to invest in two competitors.""While Li's aim is to forge an alliance primarily between carmakers, cooperation there is also tricky, he added.Strong companies with a technological edge are unwilling to share areas of expertise where they have a competitive advantage, or where they believe it will be a key differentiating factor in future, Samuelsson said. For Volvo, this would be in the area of autonomous driving.""If you believe you can do it better yourself, you have no interest to share it with somebody else,"" Samuelsson said.In more generic areas such as brakes, shock absorbers and gear boxes, there is broader scope for cooperation, but these technologies can already be bought from suppliers, making it hard to have a meaningful alliance, he added. Before investing in Daimler, Geely also held talks with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA), the head of the Italian-American carmaker said this week. ""We have a number of institutional meetings in the industry; we consider them to be a matter of normal practice,"" Sergio Marchionne told reporters in Geneva, adding it had been a ""pleasant exchange.""Marchionne declined to go into detail about the talks, but concluded Fiat Chrysler did not need ""a Chinese investor.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

587,"Mar 06, 2018 08:21AM ET",Diesel collapse gives automakers carbon headache,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Andreas CremerGENEVA (Reuters) - The accelerating demise of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining their plans to meet looming European Union CO2 goals and avoid big annual fines.Executives gathered on Tuesday at the Geneva auto show are grappling with unpalatable choices: re-engineer existing vehicles at huge expense, restrict sales of some profitable models; or risk hundreds of millions of euros in penalties.Others are clinging to the hope that the image of the latest Euro 6 diesels may yet be rehabilitated, and their fortunes restored.""I am worried,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in a Reuters Television interview.""But it's our job to solve these problems,"" he said. ""I'm firmly convinced that diesel will experience a revival.""But a fresh flurry of bad headlines and the growing prospect of outright diesel vehicle bans are already sending their sales into a steeper tailspin.While diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates than gasoline engines, their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases. As consumers shun diesels, more carmakers are on track to miss tougher EU carbon dioxide goals taking effect in 2020-21.SALES RESTRICTIONSSome industry insiders predict carmakers will be forced to rein in sales of larger models by raising prices to avoid overshooting the EU's 95 grammes/kilometer CO2 target.Ford (N:F) is reviewing its European line-up in light of diesel's slide and is likely to ""restrict the sale of some vehicles that push us over the limit"", a company source said.Steven Armstrong, the carmaker's head of European operations, played down that prospect.""We're not having to rethink the model line-up,"" he said. ""Of course we'll have to fine-tune the volume by powertrain by vehicle, but it's not going to be a fundamental shift for us.""VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told Reuters his business would have to consider price increases for larger models and/or restricting sales. ""We are required to be compliant (with EU targets) - which steps are necessary will become clear in 1-1.5 years. A significantly lower mix of diesels is not helpful,"" he said. Initially sparked by VW's 2015 emissions test-cheating scandal and subsequent studies exposing the true levels of NOx emissions, the diesel slump has since deepened rather than stabilizing, as Mueller and others had hoped it would.Sales of diesel cars fell 8 percent in Europe last year, reducing their market share to 44 percent from a 55 percent peak in 2011. Partly as a result, average CO2 emissions increased in Europe in 2017 for the first time in a decade, according to researchers JATO Dynamics.That was before the latest PR setbacks, in which VW admitted using monkeys and humans to test exhaust gas, and a court ruled that German cities were free to ban older diesel cars - joining Paris, London and a host of other urban centers that have vowed to run them off the road.Diesel sales were down another 19 percent in Germany last month, and a whopping 24 percent in Britain, amid concern that the decline in second-hand values would give way to collapse.'TOO LATE'French carmakers, which have relied heavily on diesels to meet CO2 goals, are now scrambling for alternatives.  Renault  (PA:RENA) has stepped up development of a low-cost hybrid known as ""Locobox"", but the powertrain won't even begin rolling out until 2021.PSA Group (PA:PEUP) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares insisted last week the  Peugeot  maker remained on track. In a newspaper interview the same day, however, he urged governments to suspend penalties for non-compliance until electric car charging networks are better developed.Tavares said on Tuesday he would seek backing for his demands from Europe’s ACEA car industry lobby group, which he currently chairs.Fuel-saving 48-volt hybrids being rushed out across the Peugeot, Citroen and newly acquired Opel line-ups are not expected to arrive before 2022 under current plans.""It's not just at PSA that it's happening too late – it's happening too late everywhere,"" said Philippe Houchois, a London-based automotive analyst with investment bank Jefferies.""The cost of CO2 compliance is one of the potential triggers of the next auto recession,"" Houchois said. ""Manufacturers are going to have to raise prices on larger petrol cars to meet their emissions targets, and that's going to hit sales overall.""Already last October, investment research house MSCI was warning that ""all carmakers apart from Toyota (T:7203) are at risk of missing regulatory targets for fleet emissions in 2021"".The Japanese carmaker is dropping diesels from its European fleet as it benefits from two decades of dominance in petrol-electric hybrids.  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is expected to announce a diesel phase-out in its mid-term plan, due in June.German premium automakers are also better resourced to absorb the shock, by ramping up sales of plug-in hybrids already in their portfolios or pipelines while rushing out 48-volt technology to curb emissions across existing model lineups - including the two-year-old Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) E-Class.But the strategy of leaning on costly plug-ins for CO2 compliance has limits, as well as profitability perils.BMW (DE:BMWG) admits it is already taking a hit on the hybrid version of its X5 SUV, priced 600 euros below the diesel version at 72,500 euros ($89,500), despite its higher cost.""The profitability of plug-in hybrids is below that of cars with pure combustion engines,"" a company spokesman said.That spells bigger trouble for volume brands, which lack the lucrative luxury models to offset ""compliance cars"" sold at lower profit or even a loss to meet CO2 goals.""If everybody wants to sell a lot of electrified vehicles, the prices are going to collapse,"" said one PSA Group engineer.""And since it's a market that's already quite unprofitable, people are just going to lose their shirts.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We have our own concerns and will talk to the different sensibilities of the Iranian system to get our point across.""Trump has said European allies must help ""fix"" the nuclear deal before a May 12 deadline. Le Drian said on Sunday that Iran needed to address concerns over its ballistic missile program or risk new sanctions. Iran immediately rejected France's concern over its missile program as ""wrong"", the semi-official Fars News agency said.Hardline media reacted angrily to Le Drian's remarks with headlines like ""Rude guest"" and ""Weapons of mass seduction lands in Tehran"", while highlighting Iran's determination to go ahead with its missile program. Fars said a group of hardliners gathered at Tehran's International Mehrabad Airport to protest Le Drian's visit. The 2015 accord between France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the United States gave Iran relief from economic sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear program, allowing Tehran to talk trade with Europe for the first time in years.The nuclear deal that was pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani's headline achievement has failed to bring the immediate economic benefits that many expected. That has slowed down Rouhani's efforts to engage with the West, opposed by influential allies of Iran's top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who remain uneasy about Iran’s efforts to court its old enemies.France has been quick to restore trade ties. Planemaker Airbus, oil major Total and automobile manufacturers Peugeot and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have signed deals, all of which could be at risk if Trump walks out of the accord.In an effort to keep him on board, French President Emmanuel Macron has criticized Iran's ballistics program and raised the possibility of new sanctions. On the eve of Le Drian's visit, he told Rouhani France expects Iran to make a ""constructive contribution"" to solving crises in the Middle East, Macron's office said on Sunday.Tehran supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against rebels, including groups backed by the West, and backs Israel's enemy Hezbollah in Lebanon. The two presidents agreed in their phone call to work together in the coming days with the United Nations, the Syrian government and other countries involved to improve the situation for civilians and make a ceasefire effective, Paris said. France has urged Washington to see the nuclear deal separately from Iran's regional activities and its missile program, and Le Drian will stress Macron's commitment to the nuclear accord, especially as Iran is respecting its terms, French officials said. Le Drian is due to meet Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as well as officials close to Khamenei, including Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. Khamenei said on March 1 that Iran would keep supporting Assad's war effort and a Foreign Ministry spokesman on Sunday rejected Macron's comments about Iran's missile program, insisting its ""defensive missile work"" would continue.An official close to Rouhani said Iran ""has always been open to talks and to resolve issues through diplomacy ... but this does not mean we will yield to unjust pressure over our inevitable rights, whether defensive or anything else.""While France says Iran is sticking to the terms of the nuclear deal, it may not be respecting part of U.N. resolution 2231 that calls on it to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads. The resolution enshrines the nuclear deal, which itself makes no explicit reference to the ballistics program, but it is unclear whether the wording binds Tehran to an obligatory commitment on missiles. ""On the ballistics, the Iranian program is not compatible with 2231 and we have a particular concern on the transfer of know-how of ballistic capacity to regional actors and by that we mean Hezbollah,"" said the diplomatic source.Iran has repeatedly said its missile program is purely defensive and not in violation of the U.N. resolution. A second French diplomat said: ""While our concerns aren't directly linked to the nuclear deal, it's important we make progress on these other subjects because otherwise Trump risks killing the deal.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I knew they were quick from practices, but doing it in the race is different. But I think they were even quicker.""Little has gone right for the Audi team since the disqualification and team principal Allan McNish showed his relief at the end. Abt’s Brazilian team mate Lucas di Grassi, the defending champion, finished ninth to score his first points of a disappointing season.Turvey inherited the lead 15 laps into the 47 lap race when Sweden’s Felix Rosenqvist, who started on pole, suddenly stopped with a battery failure in his Mahindra Racing car. He later retired.When Turvey came into the pits on lap 24 he led by several seconds but a smoother change saw Abt return to the track ahead. He went on to win by 6.398secs.Turvey fended off a late attack from the  Renault  (PA:RENA) of former champion Sebastien Buemi to take second for his maiden podium for the NIO Formula E team.French driver Jean-Eric Vergne finished fifth to extend his lead in the championship to 12 points over Rosenqvist, who has 69 points, while Abt moves up to sixth with 37 points.""Now I wish I had kept the 25 points from Hong Kong as that would have made it very close in the championship,"" said Abt.""But we have a super quick car and the season is still long so we will see.

But plunging track temperatures made it hard to get heat into the tires.""The track is quicker than it was in the past, much smoother. A lot more grip,"" offered Hamilton by way of explanation.""It’s difficult to say whether the car's that much better or how much of that is the track and how much is the grip. And how much of that is the tires.""So over the next days, I guess next week, we’ll get a better understanding.""The second, and final, four-day test in Barcelona starts next Tuesday.Hamilton felt the new W09 seemed a much better car than last year's 'diva', a nickname bestowed on it early on by team boss Toto Wolff for its sometimes twitchy and temperamental behavior.If he felt ready to race in Melbourne, he recognized there was still plenty of work to lay the ""building blocks for a title fight"".""But we have no idea where people are,"" he added. ""It looks like Red Bull’s quite quick, looks like the Ferrari’s quite quick but no-one really knows anything.""One certainty is that the cars are heavier to handle as a result of the new halo head protection device, which adds at least another seven kilograms. However, teams test with a variety of fuel loads and settings, which makes a comparison of the times fairly meaningless.Other take-aways from the track were that Honda had moved on from their failed partnership with McLaren and made a big step up in reliability after switching to Toro Rosso, who did more laps than anyone.McLaren appeared to be settling in well with new engine provider  Renault  (PA:RENA), whose works team has been tipped by Wolff to make the biggest step up of any this year. Force India completed the fewest laps, just behind Haas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Red Bull won four titles in a row with Renault engines between 2010 and 2013 but the relationship soured with the introduction of the current V6 turbo hybrid units and an era of Mercedes domination.It was strained almost to breaking point in 2015 and Red Bull, who have Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Dutch youngster Max Verstappen as drivers, then re-branded the Renault engines as Tag Heuer. ""We are not going to hang around forever,"" Abiteboul said. ""I know what (Red Bull team boss) Christian (Horner) is referring to when he says that he has options. He's absolutely right. But one thing that is clear is planning.""At the end of May there needs to be some clarity as to who is supplying which team. As far as we are concerned, that will be our deadline.""The season starts on March 25 in Australia but Horner has expressed concern, despite his car being fastest when testing started on Monday, after Renault said they would put reliability before performance for the first few races.Abiteboul said being an engine provider was an often thankless task but the rules, with a driver's allocation reduced to three units from four, made reliability even more important.""It's a no-brainer that this is what you have to put as a priority,"" he said.""The key message is that the fact of being reliable opens up more options in terms of performance. The two go together. When you work on reliability, you actually work on performance also,"" added the Frenchman.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Daimler said it was cooperating with the U.S. authorities and had agreed upon strict confidentiality with the Department of Justice. It has not been charged with anything by the U.S. authorities.The EIB said it would need to wait for the outcome of official investigations before deciding whether Daimler should repay the loans, the newspaper said.A Daimler spokesman told Reuters it had received a request for information from the EIB and was cooperating with the bank. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was found in 2015 to have illegally installed software ""defeat devices"" to dupe U.S. regulatory tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history.

Geely and the German economy ministry declined to comment.Chinese investors in German technology companies have tended to take a consensual approach, buying incremental stakes in companies such as robotics firms Kuka and Kion, typically after long consultation with management and other stakeholders.In November, Geely asked Daimler to issue new shares so it could buy a stake, as a way to access Mercedes-Benz technology for electric cars and trucks, including battery technology, to help Geely comply with a Chinese crackdown on pollution. But the German company turned down the offer saying it did not want to dilute existing shareholders, sources at the time told Reuters.Li changed tactics, and quietly amassed a stake of 9.69 percent worth $9 billion at Daimler's current share price.The sources said former  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Germany CEO Dirk Notheis was the architect of amassing the Daimler stake, working with former Morgan Stanley China executive Yi Bao.Notheis declined to comment, while Bao was not reachable. German state secretary at the economy ministry, Matthias Machnig, said separately that EU trade ministers meeting next week in Sofia would discuss how better to protect strategically important European companies from unwanted investors.""It is important that Europe keeps a close eye on which key European technologies foreign strategic investors are setting their sights on,"" he said.Machnig did not comment specifically on Daimler.EXPANSION DRIVEOnly two or three auto manufacturers will likely survive, a source familiar with Li's thinking told Reuters, prompting Geely to seek access to carmakers with a technological edge.Daimler is also the only one of Germany's three carmakers not to be controlled by a family. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is majority-owned by the Porsche-Piech clan, while BMW (DE:BMWG) is 47 percent owned by Susanne Klatten, Germany's richest woman, and her brother Stefan Quandt. Geely's move poses a challenge to the German carmaker, since Mercedes-Benz already has an industrial alliance to develop cars and trucks with Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA), which owns a 3.1 percent stake in Daimler, and has announced plans to build electric cars with existing Chinese joint-venture partner BAIC Motor Corporation (HK:1958).Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton said: ""It's not clear what Geely wants and how it's going to work, but we view this move as part of a broader Chinese move to gain involvement in the European automotive industry.""""China wants a payback after spending a decade gifting the European auto industry super-normal growth and profits. Now it wants more direct access to technology, brands and profits,"" he wrote in a note shortly after the stake was disclosed.Zhejiang Geely Holding owns Volvo Cars, LEVC, the maker of London's black cabs, and last year took a majority stake in sports car maker Lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in Malaysian automaker Proton, a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks and control of flying car start-up Terrafugia. ""NOT SEEKING CONTROL""Geely sees potential in Daimler because it is developing high-speed connectivity for autonomous cars at a time when Li believes satellite-based internet connections could become more important, the source familiar with his thinking said. The source said Daimler and Geely had not held concrete talks about how to structure a potential joint venture, adding: ""You know we have to become a stakeholder in order to engage.""Swedish truck maker AB Volvo, one of Geely's other investments, has objected to the Chinese firm's stake-building in Daimler, citing anti-trust concerns, the source added. ""We will protect interests of both companies by abiding laws in the country and the company's governance structure. We are not seeking to have a controlling power in Daimler,"" the source added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

604,"Feb 23, 2018 04:53AM ET",Easy Ride trial to mark Nissan's first stop on road to taxi services,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuYOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is taking its first steps to becoming an operator of autonomous vehicle services, hoping to break into a segment set to be dominated by Uber [UBER.UL] and other technology firms.While automakers for more than a century have based their business models on individual car ownership, Japan's No.2 automaker and its rivals are now preparing for a future in which self-driving cars are anticipated to curb vehicle ownership.In partnership with Japanese mobile gaming platform operator DeNA Co, Nissan will begin public field tests of its Easy Ride service in Yokohama next month, becoming among the first major automakers anywhere to test ride-hailing software developed in-house, using its own fleet of self-driving electric cars. Easy Ride, which Nissan plans to launch in Japan in the early 2020s, is meant to feel more like a concierge service on wheels, making - for example - restaurant recommendations while the car is on the move.The announcement follows an agreement by Nissan and its automaking partners  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp earlier this month to explore future cooperation with Chinese transportation services conglomerate Didi Chuxing.These moves mark a push by the automaker to avoid becoming the ""Foxconn of the auto industry"": a mere vehicle supplier to ride- and car-sharing companies. ""We realize that it's going to take time to become a service operator, but we want to enter into this segment by partnering with companies which are experts in the field,"" Nissan's chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, told Reuters in an interview this month. A person close to the deal has said that the agreement is intended to explore opportunities for Nissan and others to supply battery-electric cars to Didi Chuxing for a new electric car-sharing service it is setting up in China. He noted, however, that Nissan and its alliance partners could explore a broader agreement, which might possibly involve Nissan providing self-driving taxi technology to the dominant Chinese ride-hailing service.""We expect that the technology that we gain (from Easy Ride) will help all companies in the alliance to improve their capabilities,"" said Ogi Redzic, head of connected vehicles and mobility services at the automaking group. ""When it comes to services, we will probably have different local partners who will help bring services to their respective markets."" NICHE MARKETCreating an upscale autonomous taxi service, rather than trying to beat other companies on price, could help Nissan against bigger competitors like Uber, market experts say.""By doing something with a more premium feel, it could allow Nissan to charge more for its service and potentially relieve some of that profitability pressure they could face if they were to try to race to the bottom in terms of pricing,"" said Jeremy Carlson, automotive analyst at IHS Markit.Automakers are looking for ways to profit from the rise of car-sharing services, which along with self-driving cars, are likely to lead to a decrease vehicle ownership and chip away at future profits.IHS Markit expects global sales of autonomous vehicles will soar to more than 33 million units in 2040 from 51,000 in 2021, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has predicted that the ride-hailing market will grow eightfold by 2030 to be five times the current size of the taxi market. Nissan has embraced new technologies, launching the Leaf, the world's first mass-market electric car, in 2010. The company was an early proponent of self-driving cars, pledging in 2013 that it would market fully autonomous cars in 2020.Although it has been rolling out automated highway driving functions and self-parking capabilities in a growing number of its models, rivals ranging from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to Subaru Corp have installed increasingly advanced self-driving features in their cars. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) are building and expanding car-sharing services, and GM has said it plans to launch a self-driving taxi service next year. Nissan also has its own car-sharing service using its ultra-compact battery electric models, but after years of trials, the service is available only in Yokohama, where the company is headquartered.After bringing in Redzic in early 2016 from Here Technologies, where he led the mapping data firm's automotive business group, Nissan in the past year or so has begun to crank up efforts to compete in the new transportation area.Its partner DeNA is one of the world's biggest social gaming networks with 30 million users. The company's expertise in developing real-time user interfaces and payment systems will help give shape to the taxi service platform. DeNA already operates a user-sourced car-sharing app and has been testing self-driving shuttle buses in Japan, and had been developing a self-driving taxi system with a Japanese robotics start-up before teaming up with Nissan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That was two weeks of intense effort to get right,"" he added.McLaren face strong competition even in midfield while Mercedes have won the last four drivers' and constructors' championships, with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Red Bull their closest competitors last year.""We are humble about the challenge ahead, but feel we've prepared well, have a solid package that we can build upon and exploit as the season progresses, and have two excellent drivers who will make the difference in races,"" said racing director Eric Boullier.The car was due to make its track debut at a filming day in Spain on Friday before testing starts in Barcelona on Monday.

There are around 15 million diesel vehicles on German streets and environmental groups say levels of particulates exceed the EU threshold in at least 90 German towns and cities.Local courts ordered them to bar diesel cars which did not conform to the latest standards on days when pollution is heavy, startling German carmakers because an outright ban could trigger a fall in vehicle resale prices, and a rise in the cost of leasing contracts, which are priced on assumed residual values.The German states concerned, where the carmakers and their suppliers have a strong influence, appealed against the decisions, leaving Germany's federal administrative court - the court of last resort for such matters - to rule on whether such bans can legally be imposed at local level.""The key question is whether bans can already be considered to be legal instruments,"" said Remo Klinger, a lawyer for DUH. ""It's a completely open question of law.""Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a shift to electric vehicles.DIESEL? NEIN DANKE Evercore ISI forecasts a 5 percent fall in diesel residual values could result in a drop of 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) in operating profit across eight European and U.S. carmakers.Analysts at Bernstein Research have said that diesel bans in Europe would hit French carmaker Peugeot hardest, followed by  Renault  (PA:RENA). Among German carmakers, Daimler's global fleet exposure to diesel is around 38 percent, BMW's 35 percent and VW's (DE:VOWG_p) 26 percent, Bernstein said in a report from 2016.Carmakers have sought to avert total bans by updating engine management systems to improve exhaust-treatment filters, a step only possible on vehicles equipped with software-based engine-management systems.Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars with Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards to receive hardware updates of their exhaust treatment systems, costing at least 1,500 euros per vehicle.Europe's love affair with diesel is already fading, with its market share in the European Union falling from 53.6 percent at the end of 2014 to 49.9 percent at the end of 2016, European automotive association ACEA's most recent data shows.

""That (technical) team knows nothing about the finances, they’re not involved in it. They weren’t aware of any factors like that. They made the call themselves on the data.""Lowe said he had no concerns about how well the Russian, only his country's third Formula One driver after now-departed Vitaly Petrov and Daniil Kvyat, would perform.He said Sirotkin, who first appeared on Formula One's radar when he joined Swiss-based Sauber in 2013 as a 17-year-old development driver, had served a ""fantastic apprenticeship"" in the junior series.""I think he couldn’t be in better shape to hit the ground running as a new driver in Formula One,"" added the technical head.Sirotkin, who has been spending five days a week at the Williams factory since the start of the year, told reporters he was ready to deliver when the season starts in Australia on March 25.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Among country benchmarks, the UK's FTSE was up 0.6 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.8 percent, while Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed, up 1.2 percent.This week's recovery follows a turbulent start to February, when worries that rising U.S. inflation could trigger faster interest rate hikes caused a global sell-off in equities.The euro zone's volatility index dipped and remained well below the 19-month peak it reached earlier this month.""The reason for the change in sentiment may well be down to the fact that the overall global economic picture continues to remain fairly positive,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, wrote in a note.According Thomson Reuters data, European fourth-quarter earnings are seen rising 14.6 percent, a big upwards revision from last week's 11 percent growth forecast and following 15 weeks characterized by a string of downgrades. That brought Europe to just below the 14.8 percent growth rate expected for the S&P 500, though earnings beats in the U.S. stand at 78 percent versus 50 percent in Europe.On the day, the biggest gainer in Europe was Vopak, up 14.9 percent after earnings at the Dutch oil and chemical storage firm fell less than expected.French satellite operator Eutelsat soared 5.8 percent following its update. Even though its first-half core profit fell 7.4 percent, weighed down by slowing demand in its video division, one trader said net profit beat expectations and cost-cutting surprised positively.Food giant Danone's shares rose 1.2 percent after it published 2017 results.Swedish defense firm Saab plummeted 10 percent, leading losers in Europe after it posted fourth-quarter operating earnings below analysts' forecasts and proposed a smaller dividend hike than expected.Air France was another top faller, down 5.8 percent. Its shares reversed course after a positive open that traders linked to the airline's positive comments on pricing.Roche gained 0.9 percent after the Swiss drugmaker said it would buy the rest of Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion to speed development of cancer medicines.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The company did not respond to Reuters' requests to speak to him directly.A Renault spokesman said: ""We do not comment on rumors and speculation.""

623,"Feb 09, 2018 01:20PM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/INFLATION GYRATIONS Whether world markets settle down now or suffer a fresh volatility shockwave may be determined by next week's consumer and producer price inflation readings in the United States.They are expected to show U.S. consumer prices rising at the 2.1 percent year-on-year rate they grew at in December but any stronger and it would feed bets on faster Fed rate hikes, potentially triggering another dump in stocks and bonds - don't forget this whole blowout whipped up after Feb 2 U.S. jobs data showed the strongest year-on-year wage growth since 2009.If U.S. inflation does accelerate, markets could see Treasury yields get above the 3 percent level that several investment banks had set as their year-end target.U.S. inflation is not the only game in town though. British January data (due Tuesday) will be in focus after the Bank of England's recent hawkish comments. Finally, we get German numbers (Wednesday). These should show price growth still subdued, though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation.(Graphic: Market inflation expectations on the rise - http://reut.rs/2BlqSVJ)2/VOLATILITY DON'T PULL YOU THROUGHMarket volatility is back. With a bang. After months anchored at historically low levels, U.S. stock market volatility exploded this week. The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history. Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Wall Street's near 10 percent drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War.Have we now moved to a ""high vol"" regime from a ""low vol"" regime, and will equity volatility serious infect other markets? Investors will be seeking clues next week. Above 30, the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years. Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower, while so far at least, contagion to FX, rates and credit markets has been limited. That may change if the VIX stays where it is.(Graphic: S&P 500 fall vs historical average - http://reut.rs/2Bl8MDd)3/CAN EUROPEAN EARNINGS TEMPT BACK THE BULLSAnother heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent vol jitters wiping 0.8 trillion euros from the region's stocks, company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back.So will the results will stem a downward trend in forecasts? Recent weeks have seen analysts' predictions for fourth-quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, from 18 percent a few weeks ago.What's more, the earnings ""beats"" in Europe are currently 48.2 percent - compare that to 78 percent for the S&P500 index. Even in Europe, ""beat"" levels in an average quarter run at 50 percent.Companies due to report next week include Heineken (AS:HEIO),  Kering  (PA:PRTP),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Airbus (PA:AIR), Nestle (S:NESN), Allianz (DE:ALVG),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Eni (MI:ENI). One saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations. So, in theory at least, that takes some pressure off those who fall short of expectations. In the end though it might just be the moves of the might S&P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings.(Graphic: Fading earnings enthusiasm - http://reut.rs/2Bhj1Z7)4/HAPPY (LUNAR) NEW YEAR It's a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt: keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week-long Chinese new year holidays. Even though the People's Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks, repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth. It is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year - and banks fund their books for the Feb 15 - 21 holiday week. That is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks' cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with. Longer term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January and haven't kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world. Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening. Red packets are traditionally given at Chinese new year to symbolize good luck and ward off evil spirits. This could be the PBOC's gift.(Graphic: China keeps cash conditions easy - http://reut.rs/2Eui4ys)5/SUBMERGING MARKETS?Emerging market shares may have shared the pain, but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak out leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up.EM dollar debt spreads -- the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries -- have been rising but it hasn't been earthshaking and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015, 2016 and 2017.That is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything, but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch the resistance could be broken.One of the long-running EM issues - Jacob Zuma's departure from South Africa's Presidency could also come to a head, while another hotspot, Turkey, will publish its latest inflation numbers. It has been rising fast and the central bank wants it down. The catch is the government doesn't want interest rates to go up.(Graphic: EM Spreads - http://reut.rs/2BOuSiu)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

625,"Feb 09, 2018 01:59AM ET","China's Didi, SoftBank target Japan in taxi-hailing push",nan,"By Adam Jourdan and Sam NusseySHANGHAI/TOKYO (Reuters) - China's Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Group Corp will roll out a venture in Japan later this year to provide ride-hailing services, amid a global battle to control the technology increasingly central to urban transport.The move into Japan underscores a recent push by Didi to beef up its presence in markets outside China, although it will face challenges to expand its services in a country where existing taxi companies are lobbying hard against deregulation.In Japan, ride-hailing companies face strict rules that effectively bar non-professional drivers from offering taxi services on safety grounds, and are limited to services that ""match"" users to existing taxi fleets via mobile platforms.The two firms said in a statement they aim to trial matching services in Japan this year. SoftBank is an investor in Didi, which raised $4 billion to fund its global push in December at a valuation of more than $50 billion.Tech-based disruptors like Didi and Uber Technologies Inc, as well as traditional carmakers, are all looking to get ahead in the ride-hailing market, amid a global shift in the auto industry towards car sharing, autonomous driving and electric vehicles.Didi has rapidly expanded overseas in the past year since sealing its dominance in China with the purchase of Uber's local unit in 2016, ending a cash-burning subsidy war that cost the U.S. firm roughly $2 billion.The Chinese firm is, however, facing rising challenges at home, including a slower pace of growth, new rivals entering the market and drivers complaining that reduced subsidies mean they are working longer hours for the less pay.In January Didi agreed to acquire control of Brazil's 99, in a deal sources said valued 99 at over $1 billion and gave Didi a ""significant majority"" stake in the Brazilian firm.The Chinese company is also looking to break into Mexico and is expanding its presence in regions outside the Chinese mainland, including Hong Kong and Taiwan.""I can see that in a year from now, if you're a Chinese outbound traveler, that everywhere you go you'll have the option of using Didi to find a ride, and that helps them secure their existing customer base,"" said Kirk Boodry, analyst at New Street Research.TECH VS CARSSoftBank holds stakes in Didi, Indian rival Ola and Southeast Asia's Grab. Last month the Japanese firm became the largest shareholder in Uber.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said this week that given the shifts in the auto market, car-hailing platforms ""may have bigger value than the automobile itself"" in the future.Ride-hailing firms see Japan as a potentially lucrative market and are pressing regulators to ease stringent rules. Uber's new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi will meet regulators there on his first visit to Asia later this month. On Thursday Toyota Motor Corp said it would take a stake in taxi-hailing service JapanTaxi, set up by Japan's largest taxi firm, Nihon Kotsu, whose president, ""prince of taxis"" Ichiro Kawanabe, has vigorously opposed deregulation.Didi is also trying to diversify at home. This week it announced an electric car-sharing service with 12 automakers, including local partners of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and the alliance between  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.Didi and SoftBank's trial service, which will leverage Didi's ""deep learning-based demand prediction and smart dispatch systems"", will initially roll out in cities including Osaka, Kyoto, Fukuoka and Tokyo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""If you're Lewis, with what you've done with Mercedes and where Mercedes are headed, you'd re-sign with the team.""He's talked about when he stops, so that would be my guess. I can't imagine it's money or the quality of the team.""He just might be going 'let me see how this year goes, what's the rush? They're not going to sell the seat from underneath me'. That would be my speculation.""We might find they actually have signed and are just not telling us.""

That has effectively put it on life support until mid-May.""We are encouraging companies to keep doing business in Iran,"" Joffrey Celestin-Urbain, director of bilateral relations at the finance ministry told a Euromoney Iran conference.""We are in limbo on the international scene. Nobody knows what will happen after May. This is the uncertainty our French companies are facing and this is something you have to take for granted if you want to do business in Iran.""France, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979 and operates several large factories there including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA plants, has sought to deepen trade ties since the sanctions were lifted in 2016.French exports to Iran for the first 11 months of 2017 rose 120 percent to 1.29 billion euros ($1.58 billion) and imports grew 80 percent to 2.16 billion euros, Celestin-Urbain said.He said the short-term priority was to keep trade simple and complete a scheme this year to offer euro-denominated credits to Iranian buyers of French goods, a move that would keep bilateral trade outside the reach of U.S. sanctions.""There is barely any private financing channels from France to Iran so it prompted us to step in. We are hoping to finalize soon,"" Celestin-Urbain said.Tehran has been hoping for swift reintegration into global trade after the deal was reached, but its failure to persuade Western banks to accept Iranian business has become a main choke point preventing its rehabilitation.Reintegrating Iranian banks into the financial system would take time, and may require support from the Iranian government to help allay the cost to commercial banks of taking on added risk and performing additional checks.""Unfortunately Iran's banking system has yet to see full benefits under the deal,"" Iranian central bank chief Valiollah Seif said in a statement, read by his advisor Ahmad Azizi.""Iran is watching to see if politics helps or hinders business.""($1 = 0.8177 euros)"

By structuring the financing through vehicles without any U.S. link, whether to the currency or otherwise, the aim is to avoid the extraterritorial reach of U.S. legislation. The move could anger U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement reached by his predecessor Barack Obama. Washington has maintained some financial restrictions, leaving private banks - even those based outside the United States - wary of financing deals.""We put a lot of preparation into this in 2017 and we keep on working, every single day, on the conditions of our entrance into Iran,"" Bpifrance's chief executive Nicolas Dufourcq said on Wednesday, referring to the new loans. ""This is a completely separate flow (of money),"" he added. ""There is no (U.S.) dollar in this scheme... no one holding a U.S. passport.""There is a pipeline of about 1.5 billion euros in potential contracts from interested French exporters, Dufourcq told lawmakers on Wednesday.RISKING TRUMP'S IREFrance, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979 and still operates several large factories there including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and PSA plants, is not alone in Europe in seeking to deepen trade ties. A French banking source said Italy, Germany, Austria and Belgium were also working on mechanisms that would shield their companies from the risk of U.S. sanctions. It was not immediately clear how closely coordinated the efforts are.Earlier this month, Italy and Iran agreed a framework credit agreement to fund investments in Iran worth up to 5 billion euros. The accord was signed by Iran's government-owned Bank of Industry and Mine and Middle East Bank, and the investment arm of Italian state-owned holding Invitalia.The Rome government chose Invitalia over state lender Cassa Depositi And Prestiti (CDP) because, unlike CDP, it has no exposure to U.S. investors and no U.S. footprint.In October, Trump accused some signatories to the nuclear deal of profiteering from the accord. He later rowed back, saying he had told French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel they could ""keep making money"" in Iran. French banks have been severely penalized by U.S. financial authorities for their dealings with Iran before.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) received a $9-billion fine in 2014 for violating U.S. financial sanctions - even though it was imposed before the nuclear agreement was reached. European aerospace giant Airbus has complained about the banks' wariness, which has cast a shadow over deals linked to rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).Dufourcq said French export credits could be offered as soon as May or June. Bpifrance's total export credits jumped to 186 million euros ($231 million) in 2017 from 30 million euros a year earlier. It plans to more than double the amount to 400 million euros in 2018.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nissan Motor Co's sales hit a record high of 5.82 million, while French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has reported sales of 3.76 million. Mitsubishi's sales came in at 1.03 million, bringing total 2017 sales for the group to around 10.61 million light vehicles. Together, the three automakers beat record sales of around 10.53 million light vehicles at Volkswagen, 2016's top seller which also includes the Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands.Toyota Motor Corp, which held the No.2 spot in 2016, posted group sales of 10.2 million units last year, excluding its Hino Motors heavy trucks. Many automakers are trying to boost sales volumes to achieve economies of scale and cut costs amid soaring investments needed to develop next-generation automotive technologies - including self-driving cars, electric vehicles and new mobility services.This has been a focus of the Renault-Nissan group, and was a key motivation for Nissan when it acquired a controlling stake in smaller rival Mitsubishi Motors in 2016. Renault-Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn has pledged to make scale an advantage and use it to double savings to 10 billion euros ($12 billion) by 2022, based on a rise in annual sales volumes to 14 million units. Renault, Nissan and some other automakers are looking to share more vehicle parts and consolidate production platforms to trim R&D and manufacturing costs and raise profitability. Toyota is taking a similar approach, while it is also partnering with Mazda Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp to reign in the costs of developing and marketing electric cars and other new technologies.But not all automakers consider scale as a way to increased efficiency and profitability. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has concluded that size does not matter as much, selling its struggling European operation Opel to PSA last year to focus capital on more profitable ventures.The strategy seems to have worked for the U.S. automaker, which posted a profit margin of 6.8 percent in January-September. That was higher than a 5.0 percent margin at Nissan and 4.3 percent at Mitsubishi Motors in the six months through October, and a 4.8 percent margin at Renault over January-June.Earlier this month, GM pointed to new trucks and SUVs, a new, low-cost car for international markets, and the Cadillac luxury brand as possible future earnings drivers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

If some suspect financial clout played a part in the lineup, with Sirotkin backed by Russian oligarch Boris Rotenberg while Stroll's father is also a billionaire, the team pointed to an extensive evaluation process.""I'm confident Lance and Sergey can deliver the best results for the team,"" said deputy principal Claire Williams. ""The Williams philosophy has always been to promote and develop young talent and Sergey fits right into that ethos.""That much is true, with now-retired world champions Jacques Villeneuve, Jenson Button and Nico Rosberg all starting out with the team.But a Stroll-Sirotkin pairing remains a long way from the 1980s when team mates Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet, two greats with no love lost between them, raced for wins.Stroll, who last year at 18 became the youngest Formula One racer to step onto the podium in his rookie season and also the youngest to start on the front row, is now the team's more experienced driver.Sirotkin remains something of an unknown quantity, even if he performed strongly in testing.""Ultimately, Sergey impressed the team with his driving pace and talent, technical feedback and work ethic, both at the factory and trackside in Abu Dhabi,"" said chief technical officer Paddy Lowe.The season starts in Australia on March 25.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Now we need to deliver.""McLaren are the second most successful team in the sport after Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), in terms of races won, but those glory days are becoming a distant memory.The Woking-based outfit have not won a race since 2012 and last took a driver's championship with a young Lewis Hamilton in 2008. Hamilton is now 33 and a four times champion, the last three of them with Mercedes.McLaren ended 2017 ninth of 10 teams, their relationship with Honda pushed beyond breaking point and double world champion Fernando Alonso and Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne increasingly frustrated. It should not be hard to improve on that with an engine that won three races in the back of a Red Bull.GOOD CHASSIS""We’re very eager to get to Australia,"" said Brown, referring to the March 25 season-opener.""We’ve obviously had a significant power deficit that we think Renault will fix for us and that should get us back towards the front of the field. What slot I don’t know, but it will be towards the front.""We had a really good chassis last year. We know the majority of what we put on the chassis over the year correlated and worked,"" added the American. ""The improvement that you saw over the year, the most significant part of that was our chassis development.""Brown hoped McLaren might finally end their win drought, and were aiming for that to be a possibility, but was under no illusions about the task ahead.The top three teams -- champions Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull -- took all but one podium last year. ""We think we can be on the podium, but it’s tough,"" he said.Honda have now moved on to partner Toro Rosso, another new chapter starting this season, and Brown said there was no point mulling over what could or should have been.That said, he admitted he would have been more than nervous if they had stayed together.""Year one was understandable, year two improved, year three was just too big a setback,"" he said of a partnership that saw several major long-term sponsors leave for rivals Mercedes and Red Bull.""If you look at McLaren’s history, they’ve kept sponsors longer than anyone. But in the last three years Hugo Boss left to another team, Tag Heuer to another team, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) to another team. That was all pretty much performance related.""Brown, a marketing expert who joined McLaren after the departure from the helm of long-standing boss Ron Dennis, said two of the team's three fresh sponsors were new to the sport.Securing significant new sponsorship has been a struggle for most teams in recent seasons, with some would-be backers gravitating to all-electric Formula E instead.""Formula E is doing a great job. I’m not seeing many new sponsor announcements in Formula One but hopefully we can win that race as well,"" said Brown, playing down any emerging rivalry between the series.""Formula E is another form of motorsport, different racing fan,"" he said. ""We’re doing the batteries for it in season five so I’m a fan of Formula E.""I think Formula E is becoming very successful but I don’t think that is to the detriment of Formula One.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Chinese officials say that concept is ""relative"" in an emerging economy.Like other Westerners, the French have long complained about China's rules for foreign investments and its demands for technology transfers and compulsory joint-ventures with local rivals.French carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Peugeot-Citroen in particular have had to set up partnerships with domestic companies but have had only limited success in gaining a slice of the world's biggest auto market.French officials hope the emergence of a prosperous Chinese middle-class will give French companies, which tend to specialize in consumer products, an edge over German rivals more focused on machinery and equipment.But besides the usual race for market share, Macron's advisors say he will also defend a common European Union line for freer trade between the blocs, in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric.As an economy minister in the previous Socialist government, Macron led the fight to toughen EU anti-dumping rules imports of cheap Chinese steel surged. In June, he also urged the Commission to build a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from outside the bloc, which drew criticism from Beijing.""Even if on the surface the trip goes smoothly and faux-pas are avoided because the two presidents are smart and it's the first state visit, I think on substance each will firmly defend their own priorities,"" Alice Ekman of the Paris-based think tank IFRI told Reuters.A delegation of 50 company executives, from nuclear giants EDF (PA:EDF) and Areva, planemaker Airbus and hotels group  Accor  (PA:ACCP), as well as representatives of the French beef, pork and milk lobbies are expected to travel with Macron.Airbus is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during the visit, sources said.DEFINING FRANCE'S ASIA POLICYThe trip will also be an opportunity for the 40-year-old president, who has mostly focused on Europe and its neighborhood since his election, to define his country's role in Asia.The two countries are expected to discuss security issues such as North Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to hold talks with the South next week amid a standoff over its nuclear and missile programs.French officials have touted the fight against climate change as another key issue for cooperation with China, now that Trump has announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord signed in 2015.History and symbols will also feature on the trip, as they did with Trump and Putin, whom Macron received in grandiose settings such as the Champs-Elysees and the Palace of Versailles. Macron is expected to visit cultural landmarks such as the ancient Terracotta Army in the former capital of Xian and the Forbidden City in Beijing, the ancient home of China's emperors.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

648,"Jan 05, 2018 09:01AM ET",Exclusive: Renault-Nissan sets up $200 million fund to tap startups: sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is pooling $200 million in a new mobility tech fund, three sources said, in the latest move by major carmakers to adapt to rapid industry change by investing in startups through their own venture capital arms.The fund, due to be unveiled by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn at the CES tech industry show in Las Vegas next Tuesday, will be 40 percent financed by  Renault  (PA:RENA), 40 percent by Nissan (T:7201) and 20 percent by Mitsubishi (T:7211).""It will allow us to move faster on acquisitions ahead of our competition,"" one of the alliance sources told Reuters.Frederique Le Greves, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, declined to comment. The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars.Wary carmakers are struggling to embrace changes and technologies that some of their executives are only beginning to grasp. To accelerate the process, many are investing directly in the new services - and gaining access to intellectual property - via their own corporate venture capital (CVC) funds.BMW (DE:BMWG) has purchased stakes in a plethora of ride-sharing, smart-charging and autonomous vehicle software firms through its 500 million euro ($600 million) iVentures fund, the biggest such in-house facility belonging to a carmaker.Among others that have been increasingly active are General Motors' (N:GM) GM Ventures, with $240 million, and Peugeot-maker PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) 100 million-euro investment arm.CVC funds, a familiar feature of innovative sectors such as tech and pharmaceuticals, have become more commonplace among carmakers since the 2008-9 financial crisis. They let companies skip some of the formalities otherwise required for new investments, and pounce more swiftly on promising startups.The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture will also obviate the current need to thrash out the ownership split for each new alliance acquisition.It represents a further step in the integration of the carmakers as they pursue 10 billion euros in annual synergies by 2022. France's Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi. Ghosn heads Renault and chairs all three.The fund is being set up as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and then for Nissan, the same people said. They declined to discuss specific investment plans.Despite Nissan's ambitions to market fully autonomous cars by 2022 as well as a robo-taxi service, the Japanese carmaker has largely eschewed startups, preferring partnerships with established players such as software group DeNA Co. (T:2432)Renault has made several such investments including Marcel, a Paris car-sharing platform, and Jedlix, a Dutch specialist in smart vehicle-charging technology. Renault's RCI Bank & Services arm took control of car-sharing aggregator Karhoo last year and plans to relaunch the business under alliance ownership.Most or all of the Renault investments will be transferred to the new alliance venture's portfolio, the sources said.($1 = 0.8286 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index dipped 0.3 percent in early deals, while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) fell 0.4 percent.Autos stocks (SXAP) sank 2 percent, set for their biggest daily fall since July last year, dented by weaker car registrations data. New car sales in France fell 0.51 percent in December and the share of new diesel cars dipped below 50 percent for the first time since 2000.A trader also pointed to a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph citing forecasts that UK car registrations data, due out on Friday, would show a 5 percent decline in new car sales. Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), BMW (DE:BMWG),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were all among top fallers, down 2.4 to 2.8 percent.Basic resources stocks also fell back, with the sector index (SXPP) down 0.8 percent. The mining sector had surged to a five-year high at the end of last week, riding a wave of rising copper and other base metal prices, but Tuesday's dip suggested investors were taking profits after a strong run. Oil, which marked its highest start to the trading year since 2014, supported benchmarks with oil majors across the region rising in concert with crude.  Statoil  (OL:STL) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) were among the strongest gainers. Financials also rose, led by Santander (MC:SAN), Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) among top banking stocks.In other eye-catching moves, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) slipped 6.3 percent after British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) agreed to buy Air Berlin's insolvent Austrian airline Niki.The German carrier had backed out of a deal to buy Niki's assets in mid-December due to competition concerns.""The circa 20 planes not acquired through Niki are a loss but not significant for the Lufthansa investment case from our point of view,"" said Bernstein analysts.Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) surged 12 percent to the top of the STOXX, despite the firm saying its 2015 results would also have to be restated. The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to ""buy"" from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) up 2.4 percent after the company secured several new orders.

""If I come to power and am not able to deliver in three years, I'll resign.

654,"Dec 28, 2017 09:00AM ET",Hamilton joins Vettel in the fight for fifth title,nan,"By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - Formula One entered a new era in 2017 and next year promises another first even if Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton keep on winning.The Briton's fourth title, in the sport's first season under new U.S.-based owners Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA) after the Bernie Ecclestone decades, has set the scene for an unprecedented battle on the track in 2018.Never before have two quadruple world champions fought each other for a fifth crown but Hamilton and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel will be lining up to do just that come the Australian season-opener on March 25.How they shape up will be fascinating to watch, with Hamilton staying remarkably cool and composed in 2017 while Vettel let the rising pressure get to him and occasionally blew his top.Hamilton rewrote significant chunks of the record books in 2017, overtaking Jackie Stewart to become his country's most successful driver of all time and first to take four titles.He took his tally of wins to 62, more than anyone other than retired seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher (91), and eclipsed the German's all-time record of pole positions to end the season with 72.The 32-year-old scored in every race, while Vettel's challenge faded amid collisions and mechanical failures.Mercedes completed the championship double for the fourth year in a row, despite rule changes that made the cars faster and wider on fatter tires.Hamilton won nine of the 20 races while Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, the overall runner-up after leading until September, took five.Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), whose last driver's championship was with Kimi Raikkonen in 2007, aim to be stronger in 2018 -- when there will be one more race and the engine quota is reduced from four to three per driver.""I can't expect him to make the same mistakes,"" said Hamilton before collecting his winner's trophy. ""I've got to make sure I'm even better next year to stay ahead of him.""MCLAREN REVIVAL?With Vettel's team mate Raikkonen nearing the end of his career and Valtteri Bottas some way off Hamilton at Mercedes,  Renault  (PA:RENA) must also raise their game if others are to enter the title reckoning.The French manufacturer now has former champions McLaren on the list of engine customers after that team's tortured relationship with Honda finally ended.Spaniard Fernando Alonso, a double world champion who missed Monaco in May to try and win the Indianapolis 500, can hope to be back on the podium for the first time since 2014 when he was at Ferrari.Honda, who could at least celebrate Takuma Sato becoming the first Japanese to win the Indy 500, now focus on Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso. Red Bull won three races with Renault engines, with Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstappen and Australian Daniel Ricciardo increasingly taking the fight to Mercedes and Ferrari.One of those victories proved a highlight of the season, with Ricciardo triumphant in Azerbaijan in a cracker of a race.It was also a low point for Vettel, who collided with Hamilton behind the safety car in an incident of 'road rage'.""The worst feeling I had was after Baku I think, just because I sort of ruined the race with something unnecessary, so I struggled with that,"" the Ferrari driver said.Hamilton won the title in Mexico but singled out winning at Silverstone as a highlight because of the support he received from the home fans after the 'negativity' surrounding his absence from an earlier London event.That free demonstration was part of Liberty's plans to bring the sport closer to fans and raise the profile.The jury remains out on their efforts, with teams concerned about a drop in revenues next season as a result of the increased spending.There are also some big battles looming over the sport's direction, with Ferrari warning they could walk away after contracts expire in 2020 if they do not like what is being offered.Those who left the scene in 2017, apart from 87-year-old Ecclestone who was handed an emeritus title and attended only a handful of races, included retiring Brazilian Felipe Massa and Britain's Jolyon Palmer.The Malaysian Grand Prix also bowed out but France returns next season for the first time since 2008, and as part of an unprecedented triple header with Austria and Britain, while Germany is also back after a year's absence.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But, in August, Nissan gave India an ultimatum to appoint an arbitrator, the person said, adding the first arbitration hearing will be in mid-December.A Nissan spokesman said the company was ""committed to working with the government of India toward a resolution,"" but did not elaborate.A senior Tamil Nadu state official said the government hoped to resolve the dispute without having to go to international arbitration. ""There is no discrepancy with regard to the amount due, and we are trying hard to resolve the issue,"" the official told Reuters.Modi's office did not respond to an email seeking comment.The case, brought against India for alleged violations of its Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan, is the latest in a string of international arbitration proceedings against the country by investors concerned about issues ranging from retrospective taxation to payments disputes.There are over 20 cases pending against India, among the highest against any single nation.The dispute between Nissan and the Tamil Nadu government also shows the challenges companies face in India and how local disputes could undermine the Modi government's efforts to attract foreign investment and create new jobs.GROWING LOSSESSeveral automakers, including Ford (N:F) and  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), have set up production hubs in Tamil Nadu, giving state capital Chennai the nickname; the 'Detroit of South Asia'.In 2008, when Nissan and its global alliance partner, French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), agreed to invest in setting up a car plant in Chennai, the state government promised several incentives including some tax refunds.Over seven years, Nissan and Renault invested 61 billion rupees ($946 million) and set up a plant with annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles, which entitled them to receive the incentives in 2015, according to the legal notice.In that notice, Nissan's lawyers said the state government's decision to not pay was ""arbitrary"", and Nissan has ""incurred significant and increasing losses"".Nissan did not specify the business impact in the 8-page notice, but said in 2008 that state incentives were critical to the project's viability and sustainability.The carmaker, in its notice, is claiming 29 billion rupees in unpaid incentives and 21 billion rupees in damages, plus interest and other costs.Nissan, which has less than a 2 percent share of India's passenger car market, builds and sells the Micra hatchback, Sunny sedan and Terrano sport-utility vehicle. It also sells low-cost cars under its Datsun brand.The company spokesman said Nissan has created more than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs in India.($1 = 64.5100 Indian rupees)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""So we're parallel programming at the moment, season four and season five and looking beyond.""FINANCIAL MUSCLESAgag said the major manufacturers would also be a more noticeable presence in the paddock, with engineers embedded within existing teams as they did the groundwork for a new era.Some, too, had started flexing their financial muscles.""The problem when you have so many big manufacturers is that obviously they all want to win. To win for these big companies that have a lot of resources, the immediate reflex is to say let's spend more money and then maybe we will win,"" he said.""But we tried to make a championship in which that is not the main reason why you will win ... so even if you spend a lot it doesn't make that much of a difference once you go above a certain level.""The coming season will also see organizers ramping up promotional activity and marketing spend in key markets as they seek to build the fan base and develop storylines around drivers.""If you look at season one in China and season four in China, it's like another world,"" said Agag, referring to the very first Formula E race in Beijing in September 2014.""Season one in China, we didn't really know what we were doing. I moved to Beijing for one month before to try and make the thing happen and we had to basically spend every day sorting out problems.""You come now and you will see engineers from Jaguar, Porsche, Audi, Mercedes, BMW, Renault, Nissan preparing for season five.

""I think it's impossible to drive a Formula One car with one hand.""Kubica, who tested with Williams in October and Renault before then, said he felt more at home every time he got into a Formula One car.""What the future will bring I don't know, but definitively if you look at the overall picture, where I was 12 months ago and where I am now, it has been a good 12 months,"" said the Pole.Kubica was ninth fastest of the 12 drivers on track but the main focus was more on a pre-set program than speed.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was top of the timesheets with Australian Daniel Ricciardo second fastest for Red Bull and four-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, completing 136 laps, third in his Mercedes.Raikkonen's best time of one minute 37.7687 seconds was considerably quicker than Kubica's 1:41.296.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Kubica, who partially severed his right forearm in 2011 and has not raced in Formula One for seven years, looks the favorite.The 32-year-old will drive for Williams on both days, with the test much more than just an evaluation of Pirelli's 2018 compounds.""The evaluation process is ongoing,"" Williams head of performance engineering Rob Smedley told Sky Sports.""We’re going to be doing more of that this week. There’s no reason for us to rush into it. We are the best remaining seat so we have that advantage in our armory.

""It’s not about seeing ultimately what sort of lap times he can do in Abu Dhabi on a morning and unrepresentative track but really just going through all the 'tick boxes' that we’ve set for him. I hope we have a decision by Christmas.""Rivals for the seat include Germany's Mercedes-backed Pascal Wehrlein, but Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff played that down at the weekend.""I think it has been clearly said that Williams's priority is Robert,"" said the Austrian.""There is still a tiny possibility if Robert doesn't do well, but none of us wishes him to not do well.

While the move eased regional tensions that spiked after the prime minister's resignation on Nov. 4, it also exposed the difficulty of Macron's stated position of taking no sides in the Middle East.""Macron has put his neck out on Lebanon,"" said a European diplomat who didn't want to be named talking about an ally's policies. ""It's a bit like his moment of truth.""Hariri, a Saudi ally, arrived in France on Saturday days after announcing his resignation while in Riyadh, accusing Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of creating strife. Many Lebanese believe the Saudis made him quit.President Michel Aoun has not accepted the resignation and Hariri is expected to return to Beirut on Wednesday, when Lebanon celebrates the end of France's colonial mandate in 1943.Macron's maneuver, which came after a visit to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a flurry of calls, appears to have taken the foreign ministry by surprise, an example of his penchant for bypassing state organs to show he's in charge, much like former leader Nicolas Sarkozy.""So far it's a symbolic victory for French diplomacy that has enabled a reduction in tensions,"" said Stephane Malsagne, a lecturer at Sciences Po University in Paris, adding it was a ""risky gamble"" that could antagonize all sides. Macron set out his foreign policy objectives for the region in his first speech to the diplomatic corps in August, saying he wanted France to maintain a balanced position.""We will achieve our goal of fighting terrorism only if we do not make the mistake that would impose a choice between Shi'ites and Sunnis, and in a sense, force us to lock ourselves in one camp,"" he said at the time.Some French diplomats say Macron will find it difficult to appease everyone, however. Lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance after Sunnis, Shi'ites, Christians and Druze fought a civil war between 1975 and 1990, with factions often backed by regional rivals.Hariri is Sunni Muslim and President Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, is Christian. Hariri's government, a power-sharing coalition formed last year, includes Shi'ite Hezbollah.""This mediation is an introduction for a new French political role in Lebanon ... (and) a French attempt to find a foothold starting from Lebanon into the region,"" said a senior Lebanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity.""But in the shadow of big players (U.S., Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia) in the region, the French will face difficulties."" Since Hariri announced his resignation, Saudi Arabia has accused Lebanon of declaring war on it, citing Hezbollah's role in fighting in other Arab countries. IRAN'S ""HEGEMONIC TEMPTATIONS""France has a long history of commercial, political and social links with Iran that even saw Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei exiled near Paris in 1979, but it was arguably the most demanding of the six powers negotiating the 2015 nuclear accord.Under Presidents Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, who aligned themselves with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, respectively, there was a hawkish shift toward Tehran.Since the deal, Paris has been quick to restore trade ties, with planemaker Airbus, oil major Total and automobile manufacturers Peugeot and  Renault  (PA:RENA) all signing deals. That rapprochement annoyed Riyadh, which has been moving closer to the United States under President Donald Trump.""We had to reassure the Saudis ... and rebalance things. Prince Salman has gone into overdrive and that’s dangerous for everyone so he needs some love from us,"" said one French diplomat, who asked not to be identified. Tehran is now chafing in turn over France's warming Saudi ties and what appears to be a good relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due in Paris on Dec. 10 for the second time since Macron took office in May.Recent rhetoric has reflected the tensions.At a news conference on Friday, Macron said Iran should clarify what is going on with its ballistic missile program which ""seems to be uncontrolled"". That followed a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday at which Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced Tehran's ""hegemonic temptations"".On Saturday Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Iran's supreme leader, told Macron to stay out of its affairs.Le Drian has pushed back a planned visit to Tehran and talk that Macron may visit next year has become more muted. ""Speaking to all sides is noble, but this policy in the region will come tumbling down if Le Drian and Macron do not go to Tehran. Our credibility depends on it,"" said a second French diplomat.Some hardline politicians in Iran have criticized President Hassan Rouhani for trying to strengthen ties with Paris, saying Europeans will not endanger their interests in the face of U.S. pressure.A senior Iranian official said Macron's policy of ""balance"" ultimately just offered mixed signals.""He talks about curbing Iran’s defensive missile work and criticizes Iran’s regional policy and then he wants to build closer ties?"" the official said. ""France should clearly announce which side Paris is taking.... we like to expand our relations but Paris sends mixed signals and cannot be trusted.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""By using inputs from multiple sensors, and finding intelligent ways to process this data, we are gaining accurate technical insight to pioneer the automotive application of these technologies,"" said Nick Rogers, the firm's Executive Director for Product Engineering. The testing is taking place in the central English city of Coventry, the historic heart of the British car industry, where JLR is headquartered. Trials will continue into next year. Major automakers are seeking to head off the challenge not just from each other but also from technology firms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo, which is also developing autonomous vehicles. Waymo said earlier this month that it will launch a ride-hailing service with no human behind the steering wheel and has been testing the fully self-driving cars on public roads in the U.S. state of Arizona.

676,"Nov 16, 2017 04:40AM ET",Motor racing: Force India count the cost of success,nan,"By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - Force India are enjoying their highest-scoring Formula One season, the team punching above their weight to secure fourth place in the constructors' championship for the second year in a row.But, as chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer wryly observes, there is a point at which success is a bit of a mixed blessing.""Every point we gain now, it doesn't help us to secure fourth but it does cost us in entry for the championship next year, another $5,000 per point to the FIA,"" the Romanian-born American told Reuters.""We can't afford that,"" he added, before a hasty ""only joking"".Every point costs $5,161, on top of a basic sum of $516,128, when it comes to calculating a team's 2018 entrance fee. The rate for champions Mercedes is even greater -- $6,194 per point and they have 625 so far.Force India's 177 -- four points more than last year's haul -- will cost the Silverstone-based team $913,497 on top of the base fee and there is still next week's finale in Abu Dhabi to come.That is a tidy sum for a team counting ever penny, with a staff of 400 and an annual budget of around $100 million compared to rivals with double the workforce and three times the financial clout.Force India cannot overhaul third-placed Red Bull, who are 181 points ahead, and nor are they in any danger from fifth-placed Williams on 82.They will still be pushing hard, however. Mexican Sergio Perez and French team mate Esteban Ocon are free to race each other, after being reined in as a result of earlier clashes, and will be hoping to wrap up on a high.MORE INTENSEFormula One is far from a level playing field and Szafnauer, who works with deputy principal Bob Fernley to steer the team at the track in the absence of embattled co-owner Vijay Mallya, knows 2018 will be another tough battle.When it comes to discretionary spend -- the amount left over after engine bills, travel costs and staff wages are deducted from the budget -- Force India have far less than their main rivals.""For us that's probably one tenth of what some of the others have,"" said Szafnauer.Force India have been helped by former champions McLaren enduring a nightmare with Honda, Williams failing to make the most of their Mercedes engine and  Renault  (PA:RENA) rebuilding. But all three can be expected to raise their game next year.""We're up for the challenge and we will target to three-peat the fourth place,"" said Szafnauer, who saw various main ingredients to Force India's success, apart from having a Mercedes engine.Technical director Andrew Green, chief race engineer Tom McCullough and sporting director Andy Stevenson have played a key role while securing top tyre engineers and the use of Toyota's wind tunnel in Cologne were also crucial.""Mercedes have done a great job for us,"" said Szafnauer. ""But you can point at Williams and say they've got the same great engine as you but they haven't managed it. So it's not just the engine.""We like to hire like-minded people that are basically racers and all pull in the same direction to get the job in hand done without any politics,"" he added.The poaching of staff is a concern for any successful team, but Szafnauer said only two were lured away last year -- one to Renault and another to Williams.Mallya's financial and legal problems, with the flamboyant liquor baron confined to Britain and fighting a bid by India to extradite him on fraud charges that he denies, have also had to be handled with sensitivity.""We just have to reassure the staff that Vijay's issues that sometimes play out in the media, have zero impact on the team,"" said Szafnauer.""Those are his issues and he keeps those separate from the team. So far that's been the case and I don't think that's going to change in the future.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We could make a decision in one day and then leave. We’re looking at different options. Maybe Holland, maybe Monaco. Some nearby place in the European Union,"" he added.Agag said his strong preference would be to stay - not least because he had just bought a new house. But withholding tax being imposed on sponsorship payments from EU-based partners once Britain leaves the EU in 2019 would force his hand.""If there are withholding taxes on sponsorship payments, that would make our business impossible. So then we would have to leave. And of course if the people cannot stay here working then that would make us leave also,"" he said.""A sponsor from France, like  Michelin  (PA:MICP) for example, the fee they pay me will have a 30 percent withholding. So my revenue will go down by 30 percent.""And if I move to France or Holland, I will get the whole fee. It’s a no-brainer.""DOORSTEP DISRUPTIONMost of the teams are based in Britain but the country has been off the Formula E calendar since 2016 after residents near Battersea Park complained of the disruption on their doorstep.Agag said the immediate prospect of London hosting another race was slim, with a proposed ePrix down the central Mall and around Buckingham Palace rejected by Royal Parks.But talks are continuing with other boroughs.""We don’t really need to be in London. We want to be in London if we are welcome in London,"" Agag said.""In other places in the world we are really welcome. We race in the center of Paris, we race in Rome, we race in Hong Kong. And we don’t even have one complaint from residents.""Formula E will have 14 races in 11 host cities in the 2017-18 season with four new venues in Rome, Zurich, Sao Paulo and the Chilean capital Santiago. The ePrix in Switzerland will be the country's first motor race since 1955. The country lifted restrictions on circuit racing in 2015 for fully-electric vehicles.The series is part-owned by Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) and has attracted strong manufacturer interest, with Porsche and Mercedes set to enter from Year Six.

683,"Nov 02, 2017 11:06AM ET",Tyremaker Nokian flips focus after riding out Russia's rouble rout,nan,"By Jack Stubbs, Gleb Stolyarov and Jussi RosendahlVSEVOLOZHSK/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokian Tyres (HE:NRE1V), which supported earnings during Russia's rouble crisis by boosting exports from the country, is flipping strategy as the economy rebounds.The Finnish firm, which makes most of its tyres in Russia, is now expanding production there to supply the local market while cutting exports. It also plans to open a factory in the United States which will further reduce the need for Russian supplies to go overseas.The tyremaker's flexible strategy could offer some guide to other companies and investors operating in Russia's notoriously volatile and unpredictable market. Yet there are risks ahead. A limited scope to further expand production and rising raw material costs could undermine Nokian's ability to adapt to economic and industry shifts, while competition is heating up in the premium winter tyres market it specializes in.During Russia's 2014-16 economic crisis, Nokian hiked exports to account for 70 percent of all tyres its produced in the country, up from about 55 percent before, as manufacturing costs effectively tumbled along with the value of the rouble. Now, though, economic growth and a stronger currency are fuelling a recovery in the Russian auto market, and new car sales are rising in 2017 after four years of decline. Nokian has responded by redirecting export volumes to local customers. It is also spending 55 million euros ($64 million) on upgrades to its Russian factory this year, including a new production line which will lift annual capacity to 17 million tyres by the end of the year. ""We assume a sustained growth in the market in Russia in the coming two to three years,"" Executive Vice President Andrei Pantioukhov told Reuters. ""Judging by this, the share of local sales in our production at this factory will increase."" Nokian - which has two plants, in Russia and Finland - also plans to start U.S. production by 2020 by building a $360 million factory in Tennessee. This will free up tyre volumes to remain in Russia, Pantioukhov said in an interview at the company's Russian factory in Vsevolozhsk near St Petersburg.The scale of the switch was shown in results published on Wednesday. Sales in Russia and the CIS rose 86 percent in the first nine months of 2017 and accounted for 21 percent of group sales, up from 14 percent a year before.The company declined to disclose export volumes, but said they had fallen and now represented 66 percent of Russian production.The tactic is showing early promise; Nokian reported a better-than-expected 21 percent rise in third-quarter profits to 90 million euros, driven by Russia and a stronger rouble, after raising its full-year earnings forecast in August. However, it said it expected total costs for raw materials - natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black and oil - to rise by 20 percent this year. TYRES, TOBACCO, VODKAThe Finnish firm, which makes 86 percent of its tyres over the border in Russia to capitalize on lower energy costs, weathered Russia's economic crisis better than many other foreign companies.Its export drive made it Russia's largest exporter of consumer goods, in a market traditionally dominated by tobacco and vodka, and delivered healthy profits in the downturn which cemented its position as the country's top tyre producer.Nokian's ability to weather the slump better than many in the auto industry was helped by the fact that the bulk of its manufacturing is in Russia, while many other companies like carmakers rely on imported components.General Motors (N:GM), for example, wound up production in Russia in 2015 while  Renault  (PA:RENA) slashed the value of its majority stake in top Russian carmaker  Avtovaz  (MM:AVAZ). Nokian's strategy is not a unique one, however.Some other manufacturers, including steelmakers and certain meat producers, have adopted the same adjustable strategy during and after the downturn, with varying degrees of success. Among tyremakers, Nokian's German rival Continental (DE:CONG) and Italy's Pirelli (MI:PIRC) also used exports from Russia to support earnings during the crisis years. Continental's 2015 Russian exports accounted for 19 percent of annual production, which it bumped up to 30 percent by 2016. ""The emphasis on sales exclusively on the Russian market turned out to be incompatible with changing realities,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters. It then cut exports back to the current level of 13 percent as the economy recovered.But Nokian was better positioned than its competitors to capitalize on the opportunity thanks to the location of its factory in Vsevolozhsk, which was planned as a hub for both local and foreign sales when it was built in 2005, well ahead of many of its rivals.Continental's factory in Kaluga and Pirelli's plants in Kirov and Voronezh are all hundreds of kilometers from the nearest port and were not opened until the early 2010s.""The Nokian factory is very well placed logistically. Near St Petersburg, volumes are very easily redirected as exports through the port,"" said VTB analyst Vladimir Bespalov. ""If your factories are in the depths of Russia then logistics costs mean there are fewer opportunities for exports."" RISKS ON ROAD AHEADNokian faces some potential potholes though.The company has long been at its strongest in Russia and the Nordic nations, but stiffening competition from the likes of South Korea's Hankook (KS:161390) in studded winter tyres could increasingly pressure Nokian's position as a technology leader in some of those markets, analysts say.Executive Vice President Pantioukhov declined to give precise production figures but said the Vsevolozhsk factory, which can currently produce up to 15.5 million tyres a year, was ""practically running at full capacity"".Nokian CEO Hille Korhonen told investors on Wednesday there would be no space left in the plant to add more capacity after the new production line was completed.She also said the rising raw material costs would lead to a financial hit of about 60 million euros this year. Petri Kajaani, an analyst at Inderes, which rates Nokian shares as ""accumulate"", said the company's capacity restraints could limit its ability to increase sales before the U.S. plant starts ramping up.He said any price hikes on the back of higher material costs could damage the product's appeal to Russia's cost-conscious consumers.""Although car sales are rising in Russia, consumers' purchasing power is still weak,"" Kajaani added. ""If the upward trend in raw material costs continues, Nokian's margins will be pressured.""($1 = 0.8609 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

684,"Nov 01, 2017 02:20PM ET","If rates rise, hangover looms for some Britons after 10-year credit binge",nan,"By Emma Rumney and Lawrence WhiteLONDON (Reuters) - Millions of Britons are set to experience the first interest rate rise of their adult lives on Thursday, and for some of those who loaded up on cheap credit to pay for cars or cards, that could spell trouble.The Bank of England is widely expected to hike borrowing costs for the first time in a decade, signaling an end to years of low rates that fueled a rise in ultra-cheap credit and heavy borrowing on loans, cards and, most notably, cars.Regulators have clamped down on many of the riskier lending activities that thrived before 2008, from 'payday' loans with annual interest of over 5,000 percent to self-certified mortgages. Others, like motor finance, have risen to take their place. Bankers and economists warn that those most indebted could begin skipping payments on cars and credit cards, puncturing a consumer debt bubble ten years in the making.A 0.25 percent rate hike would lead to a median increase in monthly outgoings of 20 pounds for consumers who have contacted StepChange in the last year, according to calculations by the debt advice charity.That would push the budgets of up to 7,000 of the charity's clients into the red, meaning they can no longer cover essential living costs.""Our view is that this isn't mortgage apocalypse, but there's a narrow group of people whose household finances are on a knife-edge and a rate hike could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,"" a spokesman for the charity said.CAR MAKERS EXPOSEDConsumer credit has grown much faster than household incomes in the last few years, the Bank of England said in June.In September, it hit 204 billion pounds ($269.52 billion), with car finance the fastest expanding area that now accounts for around 30 percent of the total.Last year, 86.4 percent of all new car purchases utilized some form of credit, up from 46 percent in 2006, according to data from the Financing and Leasing Association.Most deals are done not by banks but through car manufacturers' finance arms, with those from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) the biggest in the UK by the amounts they are owed by consumers.These have risen from 13.5 billion pounds ($17.81 billion) in 2008 to over 36 billion pounds in 2016 - a 168 percent increase, data from the five firms' financial statements show.With credit widely available, a small but significant number of borrowers have become overburdened with multiple debts, said Peter Richardson, analyst at Berenberg.Fifteen percent of mortgage loans are worth more than four times the borrower's income, he said, up from less than five percent in 2005.Most consumer credit is offered on fixed interest rates, so would not be directly impacted by a rate increase.But with around 40 percent of mortgage lending on variable rates - and borrowers more likely to default on other loans than miss payments on their home - even a slight hike could leave the most overstretched people choosing to skip other debt payments.A 0.25 percent interest rate hike would increase the monthly payments on an average floating rate loan of 140,000 pounds by around 15 pounds a month, according to Nationwide. ""If you look back at the economics of this ... borrowers with that level of indebtedness become very, very sensitive to shocks, you have much more violent reactions,"" Berenberg's Richardson said.BANKS HAVE GOT STRONGERCut-throat competition among lenders has driven rates on personal loans down.For example, four lenders - TSB, Zopa, Sainsbury's Bank and CYBG - offer short term unsecured personal loans of 20,000-25,000 pounds at fixed interest rates of below 3 percent, cheaper than many mortgages.Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) Chief Executive Ross McEwan said on Friday growth of 10 percent per year in unsecured credit is unsustainable when wages are growing at just 2 percent.""At some point it needs to slow down.""Bank of England data shows that outstanding lending on credit cards was at an all-time high of 69.4 billion pounds in September and approaching its pre-crisis peak for other credit lines including overdrafts, personal loans and car finance.Outstanding lending on these credit lines hit 134.8 billion pounds in September, compared with 138.2 billion pounds in August 2007.Banks are, however, seen as stronger than when rates last went up in 2007.As part of tougher regulations introduced since 2007, they are now required to hold more capital against their loans.In September, the central bank ordered they increase this by a further 10 billion pounds to protect against potential losses on consumer credit, which it said were being underestimated. Lenders with a particularly high proportion of consumer lending in their overall loan books could still be vulnerable in a downturn, however, ratings agency S&P said in a report last month.It highlighted supermarket-owned lenders  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Bank Plc and Sainsbury's Bank, which both have consumer credit portfolios in excess of 200 percent of their core capital.""Our customer lending is subject to stringent and robust creditworthiness and affordability assessment tests,"" a spokesman for Tesco Bank said.""We are a responsible lender with a strong capital base, and a low risk approach to consumer credit,"" said a spokeswoman for Sainsbury's bank.Richardson likened regulatory changes to make banks behave more prudently to street lights on a dark and dangerous road.""We're now at the bits where the street lights run out.""(For a graphic on UK consumer lending boom, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/BRITAIN-BOE-FINANCE/010051HS3EP/BRITAIN-BOE%20FINANCE-01.jpg)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The flaw of the concept is that it's a completely new engine and new investment,"" Wolff told the BBC. ""It portrays it in a way of this is how we're going forward and none of the current OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) was particularly impressed,"" added the Austrian.Mercedes, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) each supply three teams while Honda will be with Toro Rosso next season. The powers-that-be are hoping to entice new suppliers after 2020 by making the V6 turbo hybrid power units simpler and cheaper as well as higher-revving, and therefore noisier, to satisfy fans unhappy about the current muted sound.They also hope to reduce the gulf between the wealthy manufacturer teams like Mercedes and those privately-owned outfits who have to pay for their engines and have far smaller budgets. The current commercial agreement with teams expires at the end of 2020, which means some existing manufacturers could walk away without penalty rather than accept heavy developmental costs and reduced revenues.Red Bull principal Christian Horner, when asked in Mexico at the weekend what the likely response to the presentation would be, said he expected ""a lot of filibustering"" over the coming months.Horner has been a big critic of the current power units, with Mercedes dominant for the past four years while teams like Renault-powered Red Bull have struggled with performance and reliability.Wolff's comments indicated there would be plenty of resistance to overcome.""The new concept needs to tackle the deficit that has been outlined -- development costs and noise level -- and all that needs to be linked with a global view of F1. We haven't seen any of that,"" he said.Renault F1 motorsport head Cyril Abiteboul told France's L'Equipe that the proposals were a good starting point but there was plenty more to be discussed, including the chassis and distribution of revenues.Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne said in Italy at the weekend that he agreed with Liberty on cost reduction but was opposed to anything that ""distorted"" the sport for commercial reasons.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

They (Renault) have a benchmark in Red Bull,"" he added.Renault and McLaren share oil and fuel partners in  BP  (LON:BP) while Red Bull are with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), the company that sponsored McLaren for 21 years until they left for Red Bull at the end of last year.That synergy could work to the advantage of McLaren, with Red Bull coming close to a split from Renault at the end of 2015 and their engine now branded as a Tag Heuer -- another former McLaren partner.There is also lingering uncertainty about what engines Red Bull will be using after 2018, with media reports in September suggesting Renault no longer wanted to supply the team beyond then.Both sides have dismissed that as speculation.McLaren, meanwhile, are committed to using the French engines until 2020 after ending their failed partnership with Honda -- who will be making the switch from Renault to Red Bull's Toro Rosso team.SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONExxonMobil's global sponsorship manager Kai Decker said his company relished the challenge of competition between Renault-powered teams and against its former partners while Horner said fuel developments had contributed significantly to this year's performance.""We've had Esso Synergy upgrades this year that have enabled us to compete with Mercedes and beat them,"" he said. ""It's not insignificant. It is absolutely noticeable and putting performance on the car.""He gave no exact figures but Red Bull's chief engineer Paul Monaghan said in Malaysia last month, a race also won by Verstappen, that the fuel upgrade had been worth a grid position.Red Bull also have top designer Adrian Newey, whose cars also won titles for McLaren, as a prize asset and Horner said he would continue to split his time between Formula One and other projects with title sponsor Aston Martin.""We've got pretty much regulation stability so the lessons we take out of RB13 (the current car) will go into 14,"" said Horner.""Obviously we're hopeful that on the engine side performance and reliability improve over the winter and they are fundamental aspects for us. I think we've demonstrated that we've got a really competitive chassis.""Since the August break, Red Bull have scored more points (156) than Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) (137), who have won four races this year and are second to champions Mercedes.""If we can take these learnings into next year's car then hopefully we can start on a stronger footing than the second or so that we were off in Melbourne at the start of the year,"" added Horner.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Red Bull have won three races this season with the French manufacturer.""Just wait until this guy (Alonso) gets a good engine,"" Hamilton told reporters after enjoying a thrilling battle for ninth place with the determined Spaniard after fighting back from last.""I really hope for McLaren, which has a special place in my heart, that next year is a better year for them.""I hope they have a stronger engine and a stronger car. Fernando's a tough cookie and I enjoyed the little battle that I had with him and I hope that we get to have many more like that,"" said Hamilton.The Briton said last week that Alonso was the best driver he had raced against as a team mate.Alonso won his two titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, when Hamilton was still rising through the junior series, and is still rated as one of the top drivers on the grid.McLaren have not won a race since Hamilton left the team for Mercedes at the end of 2012.Hamilton's main battle this season was with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, an external challenge that he said was more satisfying than the recent ones against now-retired team mate and 2016 champion Nico Rosberg.""Fighting the other teams is what we want to see, what Formula One wants to see.

The German now has a great chance to win Sunday's race, barring any recurrence of Ferrari's recent reliability problems, but he also knows the title outcome is out of his hands.Hamilton has a 66-point lead over Vettel, a four-times champion, and the Mercedes driver will become Britain's first quadruple title holder with two races to spare if he finishes fifth.""It depends on Lewis.

691,"Oct 27, 2017 04:00AM ET",Special delivery: Automakers make plug for electric vans,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - In the rush toward electric vehicles, automakers are increasingly sparing a thought for the humble delivery van, an often overlooked segment with big growth potential given tightening pollution restrictions in urban areas.Given lingering consumer concerns about cost and charging infrastructure, many in the industry expect it will take at least a decade for electric vehicles (EVs) to win over mainstream car owners.But as e-commerce begins to dominate the retail sector and cities clamp down on pollution, more vehicle makers see opportunities for faster take-up of EVs as delivery vehicles, taxis and other business uses in dense, urban areas.At the Tokyo Motor Show which opened to the public on Friday, Nissan Motor Co, an early embracer of EV technology and maker of the Leaf, the world's top-selling electric car, unveiled a concept model of its e-NV200 electric van with refrigeration capabilities, designed to transport chilled food to restaurants and homes. ""Imagine if you have city access challenges, how will you get food delivered to restaurants, and goods to customers?"" said Ashwani Gupta, head of the light commercial business at the automaking alliance of Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).""There's no other option but to go electric.""Nissan plans to launch the refrigeration model in Japan next year, Gupta said. Both Nissan and Renault already market electric vans in Europe.Nissan is also looking to introduce the e-NV200 series in China in the near term as it expects demand will ""explode"" as big cities in the country effectively ban gasoline and diesel trucks and vans in an effort to crack down on emissions.At the moment, the country's electric light commercial vehicle market has yet to be tapped by major foreign automakers, although Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) more toward electric commercial vans.Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, majority owned by Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), has also begun selling its eCanter electric light-duty truck in the United States, Europe and Japan, where it targets transport delivery services and convenient stores.As increases demand for e-commerce creates more work for delivery services, Toyota Auto Body, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, was thinking about the harried delivery van driver when it designed its LCV D-Cargo concept model.""We set out to make the delivery truck more comfortable for drivers,"" said Ichiro Mukai, who worked on the model's design.""In the past home deliveries mainly centered around larger parcels, but recently, a big increase in the number of deliveries has come just as people are getting smaller parcels delivered,"" he said, adding that this had increased the workload of drivers.The model's futuristic design is based on Toyota's gasoline-hybrid minivan models marketed in Japan, and can be adapted to operate as an all-battery electric.Removing the passenger seat entirely, the driver's seat configuration - which includes a retractable steering wheel and rounded seat corners - is designed to enable drivers to get in and out of the vehicle more quickly and easily.A removable tablet device in the center of the steering wheel enables drivers to easily locate parcels in the hold, where track shelving units and a wider door opening allows for easy access to parcels from outside the vehicle.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

692,"Oct 27, 2017 01:53AM ET","Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks",nan,"By Paul Lienert and Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them.The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday.Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year. GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were ""one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins"" in the automaker's North American business during the latest quarter.GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company's promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders.GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford's new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects.Ford's share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV ""in the sweet spot of the market"" in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.Sales of Audi's current lineup of SUVs ""pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future,"" Keogh said. Renault  SA (PA:RENA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become ""a significant contributor to our performance.""Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion. ""I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Expectation was quite low with me coming in. I think everyone from the team understood that it was a very tall ask for me in Austin.""I'm going to do my best to stay as relaxed as I was in Austin.

He had last driven a Formula One car in 2010. Spaniard Carlos Sainz had also departed for  Renault  (PA:RENA), opening up a seat for Russian Daniil Kvyat to return after being dropped for Gasly in Malaysia and Japan.Red Bull decided after the U.S. Grand Prix that Hartley and Gasly would continue for the rest of the season but Toro Rosso's 2018 lineup remains undecided even if the current pair are favorites.Hartley, who finished 13th in Austin, said he had been told only on Monday that he was continuing.Mexico has particular resonance to his compatriots as the circuit where the late Denny Hulme won the championship 50 years ago. ""I'm really looking forward to it,"" he said.""I learned a lot in Austin. It was a pretty steep learning curve ... looking forward to putting a lot of the stuff I learned into practice.

A Le Mans winner and world endurance champion with Porsche, Hartley said he had plenty of experience of handling pressure with a big team geared up for one race above all others.""These cars are very physical to drive and they should be. I was a bit stiff after the race, the position compared to LMP1 (the top class of endurance racing) is very different so you activate a few different muscles.""I was pretty happy how I dealt with it but I'm not going to lie, I could feel my neck and a few other parts of the body.

We do not believe he can make the turnaround in the long term,"" said the Austrian ahead of this weekend's Mexican Grand Prix.""Gasly and Hartley are finishing the season. Then we'll see what happens.""Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso, who are switching to Honda engines next year, have yet to confirm their 2018 lineup but have limited options from within their own stable.The team acts as a feeder for Red Bull Racing and has served as a springboard for four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel and race winners Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen.At 27-years-old, and with a Le Mans 24 Hours title and world endurance championship under his belt, New Zealander Hartley hardly fits the mould of a young driver but he has seized his chance.Dropped by Red Bull after testing with Toro Rosso as a teenager in 2009, the Kiwi returned to the fold and made a strong debut in Texas last weekend alongside Kvyat, 23.Gasly, last year's GP2 champion, made his debut in Malaysia this month but missed the U.S. Grand Prix to try and win the Japanese Super Formula series that he had previously been competing in.He returns for Mexico, with Hartley retained.Kvyat has now been dropped three times by Red Bull.Promoted from Toro Rosso to Red Bull at the end of 2014, he was demoted after four races of last season to make way for Verstappen.This year he sat out Malaysia and Japan for Gasly and returned for Austin when Spaniard Carlos Sainz, Toro Rosso's main points scorer, switched to  Renault  (PA:RENA) as part of an engine deal. Kvyat's only real option in Formula One now appears to be Williams, who could have a vacancy if they decide not to retain Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa.""Formula One is not everything.

Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley,"" the team said in a statement.Gasly competed for the Red Bull-owned team in Malaysia and Japan alongside Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who has now moved to  Renault  (PA:RENA).It is the third time that Kvyat has been dropped by Red Bull and it remains to be seen whether he returns, with the 23-year-old Russian seemingly no longer in the company's long-term plans.Toro Rosso serves as a feeder team to the main Red Bull Racing outfit, bringing on young drivers, and Kvyat was always operating on borrowed time having been promoted and dropped from the former champions.However, Hartley is 27 and was dropped from the Red Bull program entirely after testing with Toro Rosso in 2009.His return to the fold is unprecedented for a team that has cast many drivers aside over the years, but he has won the Le Mans 24 Hours and world endurance championship in the intervening years.The New Zealander, his country's first Formula One driver in 33 years, also has a reputation as a very quick driver from his time with the Porsche endurance team.Kvyat meanwhile has accumulated only five points from 15 races this season, finishing 10th in Austin, and was completely eclipsed by Sainz in the early part of the year.He was dropped from the Red Bull senior team four races into the 2016 season to make way for Max Verstappen, a Dutch teenage prodigy who is now 20 and a two times race winner.Toro Rosso are still evaluating their options for 2018, with Gasly looking sure to be one of the drivers and Hartley clearly in the frame.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

They work so hard back at the factory and here.""The victory was the 62nd of Hamilton's career and his ninth of the season.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen took third, despite finishing fourth at the flag, after Red Bull's Max Verstappen -- who had passed the Finn with a great overtaking move -- was hit with a five second post-race penalty that dropped him to fourth.""It is an appalling decision.

Now we need to have a good look but I'm sure for tomorrow we'll have more planned running and less trouble,"" he added.Hamilton, who has won all but one of the five races since the August break, is clear favorite to triumph again on Sunday but he will need to score 16 points more than Vettel to clinch the title.That means finishing first or second on Sunday, and hoping Vettel has a nightmare for the fourth race in a row. Otherwise the championship fight will remain open to the next round in Mexico.While much of the attention was on the title rivals, Spaniard Carlos Sainz and New Zealand debutant Brendon Hartley also caught the eye with strong performances.Sainz, moving to  Renault  (PA:RENA) from Toro Rosso in place of the dropped Briton Jolyon Palmer, was quicker than German team mate Nico Hulkenberg in both sessions.Hartley, who will have a 25-place grid penalty for his debut, stepped into a single seater for the first time since 2012 and looked at home straight away with the 14th best time of the morning.He was 17th in the afternoon, with Russian team mate Daniil Kvyat 1.2 seconds quicker in 13th.The New Zealander, a Le Mans 24 Hours winner, did more laps (13 more than the 56 lap race distance) than anybody else as he drove an F1 car for the first time since 2010 when V8 engines were still around.McLaren's Fernando Alonso made up lost time after a hydraulics problem in the morning with the seventh best time.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

His last win was in Spain in 2013, again with the Italian team.McLaren are currently ninth overall, out of 10 teams, and the season ranks as the worst of Alonso's career with the exception of his debut year with now-defunct tail-enders Minardi.He has six retirements in 16 races so far in 2017, and failed to start in Russia while also missing Monaco to compete at the Indianapolis 500 in May. The Spaniard has scored points only twice.McLaren executive director Zak Brown said continuing with Alonso, as team mate to Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne, had always been the obvious thing to do.""His commitment will allow us to further improve the attractiveness and potential of the wider Group, and will ensure we head into 2018 feeling increasingly confident that we’ll be able to take a meaningful step forward,"" he said.""Fernando fully understands and buys in to the direction we are taking.""Our shareholders have ambitious plans for the whole Group, and success within Formula One is a central pillar of that strategy.

Around 27,600 of these were made for the domestic market, representing around 6 percent of its global production. The automaker admitted that uncertified technicians performed final checks for domestic market models because some inspection steps had been transferred to other inspection lines, in violation of ministry rules.Checks by uncertified inspectors continued even after Nissan had said it had strengthened control of its inspection processes when the issue first came to light late last month.""Our emergency measures were not enough. We were unable to change our bad habits,"" CEO Hiroto Saikawa said at a briefing at its headquarters.He added it appeared that a focus on increasing the efficiency of the inspection process had contributed to the issue, while poor communication between plant managers and foremen also may have been a factor.The misconduct has already forced Nissan to recall all 1.2 million new passenger cars sold in Japan over the past three years for re-inspection. The company said on Thursday that around 34,000 additional cars would be re-inspected, probably expanding the recall by around 4,000 units.Japan's transport ministry said this month it had discovered that uncertified technicians at plants producing Nissan vehicles were using the stamps of certified technicians to sign off on final vehicle inspections, in violation of ministry guidelines. Nissan will continue to produce vehicles for export in Japan, including its popular Rogue SUV crossover model and the battery-electric Leaf, as the certification process for final inspections does not apply to vehicles shipped overseas. At 1415 GMT, shares in Nissan's alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) were down 2.3 percent at 84.36 euros.While Nissan has said the misconduct has no impact on the quality of its vehicles, it has raised questions about how closely rules are followed at its production plants, while also highlighting compliance issues at Japanese manufacturers. Kobe Steel, Japan's third-biggest steelmaker, admitted this month it had falsified specifications on the strength and durability of aluminum, copper and steel products, misconduct that may have stretched back more than 10 years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Together, the spending targets represent more than 600 billion yen over the duration of the plan.The mid-term plan is Mitsubishi's first since compatriot Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) bought a controlling stake last year after Mitsubishi admitted to overstating the fuel economy of some domestic models.""We will rebuild trust in our company as our highest priority, successfully launch new vehicles, and achieve a V-shaped financial recovery,"" Mitsubishi Chief Executive Osamu Masuko said in a statement.""These will be the foundations for our future sustainable growth, which will involve increased capital expenditure and product development spending.""The automaker is also targeting cost-savings of more than 100 billion yen over the next three years due to development and procurement efficiencies created after becoming a member of the automaking alliance of Nissan and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).Focusing on growing market share in the U.S. and Asia, including Japan and China, Mitsubishi will release 11 models over three years, including the Eclipse Cross compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) which began shipping to Europe this month, and Xpander multipurpose vehicle unveiled earlier this year.It will also launch an electric minicar in Japan from 2020.Mitsubishi has been working to expand particularly in fast-growing emerging Asian markets where it is most profitable, opening an assembly plant in Indonesia earlier this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The metal is one of this year’s best performing commodities, advancing 48 percent, more than three times the increase in gold and about 10 times the gain in its sister metal platinum.Palladium became more expensive than platinum last month for the first time in 16 years. The latter is used to cut pollutants from diesel vehicles, which are now less popular, particularly in western Europe, after some automakers admitted to cheating in emissions tests.Things could get worse for platinum.

Palladium, on the other hand, is expected to remain in deficit, although it will begin to ease over the long term, the bank says.Citigroup (NYSE:C) sees global surpluses in platinum stretching out to 2020, while the shortfall in palladium is set to widen to more than a million ounces next year before narrowing to 750,000 ounces by 2020, the bank said.“Despite the PGM spread inversion since the end of September, we remain favorable to palladium over the short term,” Citigroup analysts including Nell Agate wrote in a note dated Oct. 13. “However, ever-looming substitution risks prevent an outright bullish view on palladium over the long-term.”United Overseas Bank Ltd. said last week that it expects growing demand for gasoline emission-control devices to support palladium and continue to fuel outperformance over platinum.European car sales growth accelerated in August as an expanding economy encouraged purchases and French manufacturers PSA Group and Renault SA (PA:RENA) won buyers with new SUVs and hatchbacks. Car sales are set to rise further this year as manufacturers offer incentives to trade in older diesel cars for models meeting tighter pollution standards amid German government pressure stemming from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s emissions-cheating scandal."

The spokesman said the 400 job cuts - which amount to about a quarter of the facility's staff - would be carried out via a voluntary redundancy plan.This and a move towards a single-shift operation will be discussed with employees representatives over a 45-day period.PSA is committed to the Opel Astra plant at Ellesmere Port, the spokesman added, while pointing that current manufacturing costs there were ""significantly higher"" than those of the benchmark plants of the PSA Group in France.PSA's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had said last month that it was hard to decide upon the group's strategy for Vauxhall given lack of clarity over Britain's plans to leave the European Union.The spokesman on Friday said PSA would be in a position to consider future investments once it has visibility on Britain's future trading relationship with the EU and once the plant's competitiveness has been addressed.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Frenchman is half a point behind Toyota-powered Hiroaki Ishiura in a battle of Japanese brands.The rookie, who is set to return for the last three rounds of the season after Austin, has said he would rather stay with Toro Rosso and the team indicated that would be the case when he arrived.However, Red Bull motorsport consultant Helmut Marko suggested last weekend that the Japanese race might be given priority, a view that has since been firmed up according to media reports. A Toro Rosso spokeswoman was unable to clarify the situation on Thursday and did not know who would be driving in Austin.Should Gasly's absence be confirmed, Toro Rosso's options appear limited given the shortage of available drivers with the necessary super license.Former Toro Rosso driver Sebastien Buemi, who has won the Formula E electric title since he last competed in Formula One in 2011, might be one option.Le Mans winner Brendon Hartley also has enough points to qualify for a super license, with the motorsport.com website saying the New Zealander had become the leading contender.Hartley, 27, is a former Red Bull reserve driver who also tested for Toro Rosso in 2009 but has never raced in Formula One and has not been in an F1 car since 2012, before the new generation of turbo hybrid engines.

""He showed in the Renault test he is ready and there's no doubt about that anymore. Physically he is 100 percent in the car, so it's a really exciting time,"" Rosberg told Sky Sports television at the weekend in Japan.""He did double race stints with Renault and was always on the pace so there's not that to prove.

""I wouldn't say that I have one hand on it (the title),"" he added later. ""There's still 100 points available so I'm still going to keep the pedal to the metal."" Sunday’s win was the 61st of Hamilton’s career and third at the Suzuka circuit. It came a day after the 32-year-old smashed the track record to seize pole at the 5.8-km track in dominant style.With the gap he now holds over Vettel, the 32-year-old could clinch the title as soon as the next race in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 22.HURT AND DISAPPOINTEDVettel had lined up alongside the Briton, raising the prospect of the two title rivals racing side by side to the first corner, but the Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) had already run into trouble before the start.Vettel’s mechanics changed his car’s spark plug on the grid and seemed to have resolved the problem. But while he made a clean start, Hamilton chopped across to keep the lead at the first corner.Clearly lacking power, Vettel fell back through the field before getting the call from his race engineer to retire the car.""Of course it hurts, and we’re all disappointed,"" said the four times world champion, who hugged his mechanics and gave the crowd a quick wave after returning to the pits. ""For sure now you don’t look at the positives because it’s not the day to look at positives,"" he added.With Vettel sidelined and Mercedes back up to speed after two lacklustre weekends, Hamilton’s afternoon should have consisted of a straightforward drive to victory but late tyre vibrations allowed Verstappen to reel him in.For a moment it looked like the Dutchman could cause a late upset and snatch a second consecutive win to add to his triumph in Malaysia.But with back markers between him and the chasing Red Bull, Hamilton hung on.""The first half of the race was very well under control and the second part was a lot harder,"" said Hamilton. ""I had massive understeer. I'm really grateful the car stuck in and I didn't make any mistakes.""Valtteri Bottas, who had started sixth due to a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, fought through to finish fourth for Mercedes.Fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen, also struck by a gearbox-related grid penalty, was the sole-surviving Ferrari in fifth.Force India’s Esteban Ocon, who ran as high as third at one stage, was sixth ahead of Mexican team-mate Sergio Perez, as the Silverstone-based team came away with another strong haul of points.Kevin Magnussen was eighth ahead of Haas team-mate Romain Grosjean. Brazilian Felipe Massa rounded out the top 10 for Williams.Britain's Jolyon Palmer completed his last race for Renault (PA:RENA) in 12th place.

The Pole is barred from taking up other employment for three months after leaving the FIA. But in his role as head of the FIA’s technical department, Budkowski was privy to top-secret details of competitors’ latest innovations and teams feel a hiatus of three months is too short for a person with his level of access to serve before beginning work at another competitor. “I believe that we are close to reaching an agreement on the start date that would make everyone be comfortable,” Cyril Abiteboul, managing director of the Formula One team’s parent Renault Sport Racing division, told reporters. “I think that the date of early April, which is basically twice his gardening provision has been discussed. “Nothing has been confirmed yet but that is something that we are completely prepared to entertain.” Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was one of several team bosses to express reservations about the length of Budkowski’s gardening leave. Speaking to Sky F1 on Friday the Briton said the Pole’s hiring would be discussed at the next meeting of the sport’s Strategy Group. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said the industry standard for the hiatus period was six months to a year or even more. Abiteboul said an April 2018 start for Budkowski would mean he would be joining too late to have an influence on next season’s car, with the design already locked in. “… Because of the obsolescence of information in Formula One, it’s not going to make a huge difference,” said Abiteboul. “We have taken that person because he has the skills, he has the experience of Formula One… it’s not for what he knows today.” Renault returned to Formula One with a works team last year after buying the struggling Lotus squad.

716,"Oct 06, 2017 07:33AM ET",Renault expects electric cars and emerging markets to boost sales,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) expects a first-mover advantage in electric cars and a wider range of vehicles for emerging markets to help it deliver a 44 percent sales increase by 2022.Electric cars are ""turning into a significant contributor to our performance while other automakers are just starting the journey"", Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on Friday.Renault's mid-term plan shows it growing faster than alliance partner Nissan (T:7201), which it trails in China, due to recent investments in Iran and India and a Russian rebound.While taking a lead in electric vehicles had come at the expense of profitability, Ghosn expects to turn this around with the launch of eight new battery-powered models and 12 hybrids.""Our vision now is a profitable core business,"" he said. Renault and Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) Smart are likely to extend their small-car cooperation into electric models, he added. Renault plans to increase annual sales to 5 million vehicles by 2022 from 3.47 million last year while also aiming for a 7 percent operating profit margin and 70 billion euros ($82 billion) in revenue, goals that were announced in February.Renault said on Friday that its margin would remain above 5 percent in the intervening years, as it pursues 4.2 billion euros in cumulative productivity gains and invests 18 billion euros in research and development.The company also outlined a new dividend policy, promising to increase shareholder payouts to 15 percent of earnings by 2022, from 7 percent last year.In addition, it will continue to pass through its own Nissan and  Daimler  dividends to Renault shareholders. Renault owns 43.4 percent of its Japanese alliance partner and 3.1 percent of the Mercedes-Benz maker.Renault's share price was up 1.5 percent at 86.86 euros at 1100 GMT and the price might be supported in the coming weeks by ""management's increased confidence"" over its mid-term goals, Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.""This is good news in a world where most people fear earnings, cash flow and profitability will fall due to disruption,"" Ellinghorst said.LOW-COST RANGEThe market in China, where Renault only began manufacturing last year, is expected to account for half a million sales by 2022.Renault's budget car line-up, starting with the Dacia Logan in 2004, has underpinned the push into emerging markets and spawned a second car platform underpinning the Kwid mini-SUV, which has more than doubled the group's sales in India.Combined sales of the ""Global Access"" low-cost cars are seen expanding 54 percent to reach 2 million vehicles, or 40 percent of the group total. An expanded utility van range is also expected to contribute to the emerging-markets surge.Europe's share of Renault vehicle deliveries would shrink to 36 percent from 52 percent under the plan, with sales in the home region remaining broadly flat.Pure electric cars may rise to about 5 percent of global sales, Ghosn said, adding that the forecast was ""probably conservative"" and almost certainly wrong.Renault has been transformed since 2005 when he took over from a carmaker dependent on French sales of Megane compacts into a ""resilient, multi-polar global company"", Ghosn said.Ghosn, who also heads the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, has not yet indicated whether he will seek to renew his contract as Renault's CEO, which expires next year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Force India pair of Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon, and Williams duo Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll were the only other cars brave enough to attempt a flying lap.The 18-year-old rookie Stroll was briefly caught out by the conditions, running wide and skirting the barriers before rejoining the track without causing damage to his car.The Canadian's excursion elicited a rare smile from Kimi Raikkonen but neither the Finn nor his team mate Vettel set a time, both completing just a sole installation lap.Hamilton leads Vettel by 34 points in the overall standings with five of the season's 20 races remaining.The German suffered successive setbacks at the last two races in Singapore and Malaysia, which Hamilton capitalized on with a win and second-place finish to extend his advantage.Mercedes struggled for speed at both grands prix, though, with the reigning champions only the third fastest team on both occasions, and Friday's rain-hit practice offered few clues as to whether the team had rediscovered its lost pace.The Red Bull's of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen, who won the last race in Malaysia, did not set a time in the afternoon but had been third and sixth quickest in the morning session, respectively.Valtteri Bottas, in the other Mercedes, ended the day fifth with his morning's best as Ocon came seventh.Nico Hulkenberg was eighth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), ahead of Haas driver Romain Grosjean, while Stoffel Vandoorne set the 10th fastest time in his McLaren at power unit supplier Honda's home race. The morning session did not pass without incident, however, as Carlos Sainz brought out the red flags after 51 minutes when the Spaniard crashed after losing control of his Toro Rosso at the exit of the turn 11 hairpin.The Renault-bound Spaniard, already set for a hefty grid penalty for exceeding his power unit component allocation, walked away unscathed but his car came to a rest across the track, leading to a 16-minute delay as the debris was cleared.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

You cannot evaluate too much,"" he added.Kubica, 32, has tested already this season with  Renault  (PA:RENA), his former team, completing 142 laps of the Hungaroring in August in a contemporary car.But the French manufacturer picked Carlos Sainz to replace under-performing Briton Jolyon Palmer instead for 2018.""Definitely I think it would be good for the team and also for myself that we know what’s going to happen before the race in Brazil,"" said Massa, who was given a touching send-off by fans at Sao Paulo’s Interlagos track last year.""We’ll see if this is possible but I really hope so.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Brazil is seen by Peugeot, a Groupe PSA company, as one of five priority markets in the world, said Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Imparato to reporters in Sao Paulo on Wednesday.""Sales volumes are not our outright target. I prefer to boost our brand image,"" he said.""We are not going to fall again in the temptation of developing a small car specifically for Brazil, we are not going to sell at any price,"" he added, detailing the plan for the Brazilian market to converge to the same set of models Peugeot offers in Europe in five years' time.France, Iran and China are currently the largest markets for Peugeot. He declined to cite a target for Brazil or Latin America, but said the fact the firm has defined the country as a priority underscores the potential it sees for future brand development.According to Brazilian car dealers association Fenabrave, Peugeot sold 19,128 vehicles in the country this year, accounting for a market share of 1.22 percent. Its French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) has 7.79 percent share while the leader General Motors (NYSE:GM), 17.9 percent.Peugeot is also looking to offer high-end models such as premium SUVs. In June it launched its 3008 model in Brazil and said there was a four-month wait for interested buyers to get the car.Imparato said the situation was a problem, due to higher than expected demand, but also an opportunity.The company will next year sell the 5008 version of the car in Brazil.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I think we should have been quicker than we were (in Malaysia) but Suzuka should be much more in the window.""I'm very much looking forward to Suzuka to see how the car behaves there because it should be completely different.""Last year, Hamilton arrived in Japan ill at ease and still feeling the agony of an engine failure at Sepang while leading from pole position -- a blow that ultimately cost him the championship.He played around on Snapchat and then moodily refused questions from 'disrespectful' media who criticized his behavior.This time he is riding a run of good fortune, with an opening lap crash for Vettel in Singapore dealing the German a significant setback in a race that the Briton went on to win.In Malaysia he finished second after his rival raced to fourth place from last on the grid due to a power unit problem in qualifying.Vettel had a new engine for Sepang and the four times winner in Japan will expect to be quick on Sunday, with fears for his car's gearbox subsiding since he and Canadian Lance Stroll collided on the post-race slowing down lap.""It's been a difficult weekend, but nevertheless the speed is there,"" said the four-time champion, who has four wins this year to Hamilton's seven.But both he and Hamilton also have to contend with a resurgent Red Bull.""The Red Bulls are right in it now,"" said former racer and television commentator Martin Brundle.""You think of Suzuka, it's just one corner after another. You always want power but they should be mighty in Suzuka, the Red Bulls.""Sunday's race will also be Honda's last home grand prix as power unit suppliers to McLaren, with the Japanese manufacturer set to tie up with Toro Rosso next year.The Woking-based team head into the weekend having chalked up their first consecutive points finishes of the season.A third race in the points this weekend, at a track owned by Honda, will see McLaren, who are switching to  Renault  (PA:RENA) power next year, equal their best successive run of top-10 finishes since joining forces with the Japanese firm.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""How on earth can the industry build/buy/find enough batteries or raw materials if and when EV demand takes off? This is a critical missing piece of the puzzle,"" they wrote.Demand for electric cars remains weak due to limited charging infrastructure and the high costs of purchasing a vehicle.

Toyota shares were flat.Both automakers are somewhat behind rivals, with neither having a fully electric passenger car on the market yet.After years of focusing on bringing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to the market, Toyota last year set up a division to develop electric cars which is led by President Akio Toyoda, and said it plans to introduce EVs in China in the coming years.That division would continue as a separate entity from the new joint venture, a Toyota spokeswoman said, while adding that the two teams would co-operate on technology development.Mazda has an R&D budget a fraction of Toyota's, which has made it difficult to develop electric cars on its own. Even so, it has said it plans to launch EVs in 2020.By comparison, Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) has the world's top selling electric car, the Leaf, and it and partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) expect electric models to account for 30 percent of their vehicle sales by 2022.Competition from unexpected quarters is also heating up.

A demonstration line will be ready by 2019, ABB said in a statement.Carlsson's vision comes against the backdrop of automakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), VW and Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201) all planning a rapid ramp-up in electric car production in the coming years.VW, for instance, plans to invest more than 20 billion euros in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 to challenge pioneer Tesla in creating a mass market.Carlsson told a press conference on Tuesday that between 80 million euros and 100 million euros is needed to fund the Swedish factory's pre-production line. That represents the first tranche of a total $4 billion in fundraising targeted in March.More deals are expected in the near future, Carlsson said on Tuesday. ""I can't say exactly when we will announce them, but we are in a number of different parallel discussions,"" he said.ABB intends to supply robotics, automation and electrification solutions for the project.Northvolt has been considering two Swedish cities -- Vasteras and Skelleftea -- for the factory's location and is expected to announce its decision in mid-October."

""If and when the diesel market is dropping, something else needs to take its place.""Diesels are stalling already, in fact - and weaker second-hand values suggest the slump can only accelerate.An attention-grabbing pledge by the Swedish carmaker to ""electrify"" its entire range by 2019, initially hailed as a bold step, now looks more like an industry-wide reality.PSA Group, which had previously seen no need for 48V hybrids, now plans to introduce them ""across the board"" in response to diesel's faster-than-expected decline, the Peugeot maker's programs chief Patrice Lucas told Reuters.By quadrupling the 12-volt standard in conventional car electrics and allowing a beefed up starter motor to feed extra power to the drivetrain, complementing the combustion engine, carmakers can transform petrol cars into mild hybrids without redesigning the vehicle's architecture and factory tooling.ENABLING TECHNOLOGYThe motor delivers a noticeable torque boost and recovers braking energy to recharge a battery - smaller and cheaper than those required by electric cars or ""full"" hybrids such as Toyota's Prius, which typically run at 100-300 volts. Total manufacturing cost comes in 500-1,000 euros ($600-$1,200) below an equivalent diesel.""It's the most interesting enabling technology and will comfortably replace diesel,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. ""It can do the job and it's already cheaper - you don't have to be an early adopter to buy one.""By 2020, the brokerage expects 48V cars to outpace European sales of full hybrids, including plug-ins that can be recharged with a cable and driven in electric-only mode. By 2025, it predicts, they will equip 55 percent of all cars sold.The technology is surfacing first in luxury cars such as the Mercedes S-Class on show at the Frankfurt event - which runs until Sunday - before trickling down to the mass market, chiefly in Europe and China.Volkswagen's next Golf, a benchmark in compact cars, will arrive with 48V electrics in 2019, and other models will follow, development chief Frank Welsch told Reuters. ""The technology has a lot of potential and will make hybrids more affordable for the masses,"" Welsch said.  Renault  (PA:RENA), Japanese affiliate Nissan and Hyundai are among other mass car manufacturers with 48V in the pipeline.In 2021, the key EU emissions goal drops to 95 grammes of CO2 per kilometer from its current 130 grammes - a challenge exacerbated by the replacement of standard lab tests with on-the-road ""real driving emissions"" measurements.DIESEL HEADACHEDespite incentives, neither battery technology nor charging infrastructure is ready for the mass electric-car uptake required to put a dent in average emissions by then.The headache is compounded by the decline of diesels, which emit 15-20 percent less CO2 than petrol alternatives. Fortunately, 48V hybrids deliver savings in the same bracket.Their simplicity also lets carmakers adjust their fleet emissions on shorter lead times than typically required to redevelop a drivetrain, which may help to avoid stiff EU fines of 95 euros per excess gramme of CO2, per vehicle sold.Among suppliers, Valeo stands to benefit most with a 40 percent share of mild-hybrid orders, Citi analysts predict. Continental and Delphi are also well positioned.Paris-based Valeo expects some carmakers to effect more abrupt U-turns than PSA's - in some cases installing 48V systems without waiting for model facelifts. Innovation director Guillaume Devauchelle declined to name names.""These solutions will become market standards,"" Devauchelle said, adding that tougher rules on nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution from diesels would deepen their cost disadvantage.Later 48V hybrids will squeeze out more efficiency by shifting the electric motor lower down the transmission, below the engine. Valeo has electrified Magna's Getrag gearboxes and GKN (LON:GKN) differentials.""What automakers are finding is they need more than just advanced combustion engines to reach the fleet average reductions,"" said Mary Gustanski, Delphi's engineering boss.The supplier is combining 48V hybrids with cylinder deactivation that cuts engine capacity when less power is required, for additional savings. The system is in development with one European and one Chinese carmaker, Gustanstki said.The coming profusion of 48V cars should outsell pricier, higher-voltage hybrid incumbents such as the Prius, as market projections show - a prospect Toyota takes in its stride.Thanks to a quarter-century of hybrid investments, the Japanese carmaker can meet future CO2 targets with ease, global planning chief Didier Leroy said in Frankfurt.""We're in a different position,"" Leroy said. ""We don't have to rush to find a temporary solution - we don't need to develop 48V to be competitive.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He was 0.415 seconds off Ricciardo's pace.The Briton, who seized the overall lead from title-rival Vettel after leading Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas to a one-two finish in Monza, is expecting a less straightforward weekend in Singapore.The tight twists of the circuit are expected to play to Ferrari’s strengths, with the Italian outfit dominant at similar layouts in Monaco and Hungary earlier in the year.Red Bull are also hoping the circuit masks the power deficiencies of their Tag Heuer-badged  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine.Although the opening session was held in daylight, in contrast to the floodlit conditions the drivers will face during the rest of the weekend, Ricciardo’s pace appear to put Red Bull in the frame for victory.Sergio Perez was fifth-fastest for Force India.Bottas, who agreed a one-year extension to his Mercedes contract in the build up to the weekend, was sixth.Kimi Raikkonen was seventh in his Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) ahead of Fernando Alonso.The Spaniard’s McLaren outfit has been in the spotlight this week after the team confirmed on Friday that it would be splitting with power-unit supplier Honda at the end of the 2017 season.

The 18-year-old Renault-Nissan pairing has only recently begun rolling out cars on common architectures.Combined sales volumes are expected to rise to 14 million vehicles by 2022 from 10.5 million expected this year, with revenue advancing by a third to $240 billion, the alliance said in a statement.Twelve new pure-electric models will be launched by that date as Renault-Nissan seeks to defend the head-start it took with the current generation of battery cars, spearheaded by the Nissan Leaf and  Renault  Zoe, as more competitors join the fray.With 5.27 million cars and vans delivered in the first half of the year, Renault-Nissan now claims the mantle of the world's biggest carmaker, ahead of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota (T:7203). However, parent Renault has never consolidated the sales of its 43.4 percent-owned Japanese affiliate into its own.Under existing plans, the alliance is seeking to increase synergies - from cutting costs and boosting revenue - to 5.5 billion euros next year from 5 billion recorded in 2016.A fourth common vehicle platform will be shared across the alliance by 2022, the companies said on Friday, underpinning a future generation of electric cars which, together with hybrids, are expected to account for 30 percent of group sales.NEW ELECTRICSRenault-Nissan will aim to deliver more electric vehicles and also make greater use of shared technology and manufacturing processes.""Without a doubt, what we have seen and acted on and executed eight years ago is becoming mainstream,"" Ghosn told reporters at a presentation in Paris.Renault will soon launch an electrified version of the Kwid mini-SUV in China, he added, confirming media reports.As more models are launched on the new platforms by Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi and their other brands, shared architectures will account for 70 percent of sales by 2022, with common engines installed in 75 percent.Friday's announcement was thin on details of how closer convergence would be achieved. Relations between Renault and Nissan engineering teams have sometimes been fraught, hampering savings in areas such as engines and transmissions.Convergence efforts will continue with no radical change to management structures, Ghosn said, suggesting that he had no immediate plans to stand aside. Ghosn's current contract as Renault chief executive expires next year.""I am intending to execute on the plan as long as it makes sense,"" he said.More information on operational and product strategies and financial goals are expected when Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi each announce their mid-term plans in coming weeks - starting with the French carmaker on Oct. 6.($1 = 0.8392 euros)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Renault is set to supply McLaren in 2018, in a deal sources say will be announced at the Singapore Grand Prix on Friday, with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso switching to the Honda units previously used by the British team.Those deals have already been taken for granted in the paddock but the ramifications beyond 2018 for Red Bull, owned by Austrian energy drinks billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, threw a fresh twist on the shake-up. Renault, who now have their own factory team, and Red Bull won four successive drivers' and constructors' titles between 2010-13. Red Bull are the only team other than Mercedes and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) to have won a race this season.The Honda has been the slowest and least reliable of Formula One's four current engines but Red Bull might have to use it in 2019, given the lack of any other option at present.That could in turn affect where their current drivers, Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, end up.Both are race winners and likely to be of interest to Ferrari and Mercedes.Formula One's current engine rules run to 2020, after which new suppliers could come in.Red Bull have been linked to Volkswagen-owned brands Audi and Porsche in the past, with the latter acknowledging this month that it was considering a return to grand prix racing.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

His contract expires at the end of the season.The Spaniard is expected to extend his three-year stay at the team, but he was giving little away on Thursday.""I will think what is the best option,"" Alonso told reporters.""As I said many times whatever I do next year is because I want to win.

754,"Sep 14, 2017 07:37AM ET",Don't fear the euro: investors stick with European stocks,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - The surging euro has played spoilsport with what had become global investors' top trade this year -- buying European equities - though for some recent weakness in stocks offers a chance to reshuffle portfolios and stay invested. Fund managers, betting on diminishing political risk and confidence that the region was leaving behind years of economic sluggishness and flat-lining corporate profits, pumped money in the first five months of this year into cheaply valued stocks, particularly those that stood to benefit from a global recovery.However, major stock indexes peaked at two-year highs in May and have suffered sell-offs through the summer as the euro kept rising, fuelling worries that profits at the region's large exporters would suffer as their competitiveness takes a hit.In August European equity funds even suffered their first weekly outflows in many months, as the euro strengthened to levels that caught many by surprise.But some of the world's top funds say the falls are overdone and the euro's strength underscores the region's better prospects, so that shares of domestically focused companies could offer rich rewards.""I used to own a lot of exporters but that's changed,"" said Fidelity's Bill Kennedy, who has been managing the $10 billion Fidelity International Discovery Fund since 2004.Kennedy has already made his bets by adding to his portfolio more banks, builders and materials firms that he reckons will take advantage of a domestic recovery in the region.""The strengthening euro is a sign of improved confidence... The reality is that interest rates are going up because people are more confident and that's a good thing,"" he said.Strength in the euro not only helps many firms reduce costs of imported goods but historically it has lifted returns for offshore investors, such as Kennedy.Stocks ranging from builder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) in France to German real estate firm Vonovia (DE:VNAn) and Italian retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) are among the top picks for analysts and investors. They make more than 80 percent of their sales in Europe, which is witnessing a string of upgrades to economic forecasts as domestic demand bolsters the recovery. The European Central Bank has lifted its 2017 euro zone GDP growth estimate to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent previously.Yet the sudden spikes in the euro have clearly shown their market-moving potential this summer when the scale of overweight Europe rose close to the highest levels ever.Data from EPFR Global showed redemptions from European stock funds hit six-month highs in the last week of August when the euro peaked above $1.20 for the first time in two and a half years. Exchange-traded funds tracking the euro zone blue chip index (STOXX50E) were among the hardest hit as two-thirds of all Europe Equity Funds recorded outflows or no flows, EPFR said. Graphic for Euro story: http://reut.rs/2jqBYkKVALUATION GAP Opportunities abound under the surface.""Despite euro strength and upgrades to GDP forecasts, domestically focused euro area stocks have so far not materially outperformed,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists led by Dennis Jose said.Like Fidelity, the British investment house believes that banks and materials are the sectors to bet on and, if the past is any guide, a strong currency is a good omen.Historically, a strengthening euro has been a crucial component for European outperformance, Barclays wrote.Following the initial euro-related stress, European stocks showed signs this month they can weather the swings, raising the prospect that the focus could soon turn to company fundamentals. When ECB President Mario Draghi last week outlined concerns about currency volatility, the euro spiked higher again but European equities largely shrugged off the move. ""I believe the correlation (euro up/European stocks down) is largely emotional and it is bound to vanish,"" said Alessandro Balsotti, head of asset management at JCI Capital.One key ingredient that makes the case for investing in Europe is that valuations have become attractive again. On a price/earnings metric, the broader euro zone index (STOXXE) has never been as cheap vis-à-vis Wall Street since 2009.UBS strategists led by Nick Nelson believe the discount of stocks with large euro zone exposure is even more appealing, while noting that a strong currency in the past has sometimes coincided with decent European earnings growth.Among their favorite plays they mentioned Dutch bank ING (AS:INGA), French caterer  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) as well as Vinci and Renault, which all combine high eurozone exposure with appealing valuations and strong earnings prospects. ""Going forward, the quality of Europe Inc's earnings will be more important than the euro,"" JCI Capital's Balsotti said.Graphic for Euro zone valuation gap widens: http://reut.rs/2jlTRRB  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

McLaren need a more competitive engine to satisfy sponsors and retain the services of Spain's double world champion Fernando Alonso, whose contract expires at the end of the season.YOUNG TALENTSpanish media and online reports said Sainz - a young talent long coveted by Renault - was set to move to the French manufacturer team as a sweetener for Toro Rosso terminating their engine contract.Some suggested Sainz could be in yellow overalls as soon as Malaysia, the race after this week's Singapore Grand Prix, if Renault dispense with the services of Britain's Jolyon Palmer, who has yet to score a point in 13 races.That in turn would free up a place at Toro Rosso for Pierre Gasly, the winner of last year's GP2 championship, who has been waiting for an opening at the Red Bull junior team.""I know there are a few things going on at the moment,"" motorsport.com quoted the Frenchman, who is racing Super Formula in Japan, as saying. ""We will see in the next couple of days what will happen.""For me, it will be amazing.

Sainz, Renault and Toro Rosso were saying nothing.Spanish media, focused mainly on Alonso's future, reported that Honda had informed McLaren they were willing to switch to Toro Rosso and that Alonso was negotiating for a one-year extension.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The stock was down 4.4 percent at 17.78 euros as of 1019 GMT. So-called ""defeat devices"" restrict exhaust output of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) under regulatory test conditions while letting emissions far exceed legal limits in real-world driving.In February PSA became the fourth carmaker to be referred to French prosecutors by the country's DGCCRF watchdog over suspected emissions test-cheating, after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).PSA's engineering chief acknowledged at the time that emissions treatment in the group's diesels was deliberately reduced at higher temperatures to improve fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in out-of-town driving, where NOx output is considered less critical.According to Le Monde, an internal PSA document obtained by DGCCRF investigators includes discussion of the need to ""make the 'defeat device' aspect less obvious and visible"".However PSA insists there is nothing fraudulent or illegal about its engine calibrations.""PSA denies any fraud and firmly reaffirms the pertinence of its technology decisions,"" the company said on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

765,"Aug 29, 2017 08:12AM ET",Renault-Nissan to build electric cars with China's Dongfeng,nan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Laurence FrostBEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan alliance has announced plans to build electric cars in China in a new venture with Dongfeng Motor, joining the scramble by global automakers to meet Beijing's stringent quotas for zero-emission vehicles.The venture, eGT New Energy Automotive Co, will develop an electric mini-SUV to go into production in 2019 by Dongfeng, the carmaking alliance said, for sale under the partners' own brands. Dongfeng already builds conventional vehicles with Nissan and its French parent  Renault  (PA:RENA).China, the world's biggest auto market, wants all-electric battery cars and plug-in hybrids to account for at least one-fifth of its vehicle sales by 2025, as policymakers grapple with alarming pollution levels in major cities.Renault-Nissan so far leads the deployment of modern electric cars, thanks to the top-selling Nissan Leaf introduced in 2010 and Renault's Zoe subcompact launched two years later. But its leadership is being challenged by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as well as more mainstream carmaker rivals.Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said earlier this month it was exploring a joint venture with carmaker Anhui Zotye Automobile Co to build electric vehicles under a new brand, in competition with China manufacturing plans previously announced by Tesla, Daimler and General Motors (NYSE:GM).Renault and Nissan will each own a quarter of their venture with Dongfeng, which would hold the remaining 50 percent, the alliance said.China's electrification push has changed the thinking of many automakers that had hitherto resisted investing heavily in pure-electric or rechargeable hybrid vehicles.Hybrid pioneer Toyota had dismissed battery-only vehicles until it abruptly reversed course last year, confirming electric-car investment plans that largely reflect Beijing's demands.Renault-Nissan's move ""confirms our common commitment to develop competitive electric vehicles for the Chinese market,"" alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn said. The statement included no financial or product details.However, Ghosn has previously discussed plans to ""change the game"" with a low-cost electric car priced below $8,000 after Chinese incentives - and ultimately without them.The programme is headed by Gerard Detourbet, who developed the conventionally powered Kwid budget SUV for India and is likely to use its architecture for the Chinese battery car, an alliance engineer with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.China's latest quota proposals, due to take effect as soon as next year, would require 8 percent of automakers' sales to be battery electric or plug-in hybrids - rising to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020.Beijing will present its final plans in coming days, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, adding penalties for non-compliance were likely to be softened after an outcry by global automakers."

I didn't,"" added the German, who set a race lap record of one minute 46.577 seconds in the closing stages.With eight races remaining, four-times champion Vettel has 220 points and Hamilton 213.Australian Daniel Ricciardo took third place for Red Bull after a storming re-start following a late safety car period that had closed the gap to the frontrunners and triggered a flurry of pitstops.Ricciardo, on fresh ultra-soft tyres, passed Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas to surge into the top three, with the Finn also losing out to the Ferrari of compatriot Kimi Raikkonen as he ran wide.Germany's Nico Hulkenberg finished sixth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), Romain Grosjean was seventh for Haas and Brazilian Felipe Massa took eighth for Williams.MAX RETIRES""It's pretty much for all the Dutch here, so thanks for hanging around,"" said Ricciardo, whose teenage team mate Max Verstappen retired shaking his head in sheer frustration after eight laps.It was his sixth retirement in 12 races.""There are so many fans paying a lot for the tickets and you finish like this. That cannot happen with a top team,"" said Verstappen, whose orange-clad compatriots accounted for a majority of the crowd.While Hamilton and Vettel played out their own private duel, there was plenty of action further down the field with the Force India duo of Mexican Sergio Perez and Frenchman Esteban Ocon playing a starring role.The simmering pair clashed twice, the second time bringing out the safety car when Ocon -- who finished ninth -- tried to get past on the run down to Eau Rouge and was almost squeezed into the wall.""I can accept the first one -- perhaps he couldn't see me but the second one was ridiculous. He was risking our lives. He risked my life,"" said a furious Ocon.Debris from his car's broken front wing littered the track while Perez's right rear tyre was punctured, leaving him limping back to the pits on a rim.""It looked like Sergio squeezed Esteban into the wall and came out the loser of that scrap,"" the team's chief operating office Otmar Szafnauer told Sky Sports television, warning that the team would read the riot act.""We’ve let them race up until now. If they can’t do it in a manner which is good for the team, then they won’t be racing any more,"" he said.Spaniard Fernando Alonso was also an unhappy man in the McLaren, the double world champion making a storming start but his Honda-powered car's lack of speed leaving him with an impossible task and increasingly frustrated before retiring.""Embarrassing, embarrassing,"" he had said earlier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Mercedes and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Formula One's other engine manufacturers, are already committed to three teams each and the rules say the governing FIA must approve anything more than that.Honda are keen to continue with McLaren, former world champions who are now ninth of 10 teams and are running out of patience after three seasons of poor reliability and under-powered engines.The FIA would be unlikely to support any move that effectively forced a manufacturer out of the sport.The talk before the August break was of Toro Rosso possibly switching to Honda, freeing up a Renault supply for McLaren, but comments to reporters at the Belgian Grand Prix indicated that likelihood had receded.""There have been discussions with McLaren but right now there is a restriction in the regulation if we wanted to supply more than three teams,"" said Renault Sport managing director Cyril Abiteboul.""In addition to that, I don't think it would be reasonable to believe that we could supply more than three without degrading the quality of service for the other teams,"" he added.""If there is something to be done, why not? But right now I understand that things are very quiet and we are not necessarily proactively pushing for anything.""McLaren executive director Zak Brown said his team had supported a canceled partnership between Honda and Sauber and would be ""very supportive of Honda having a relationship with Toro Rosso.""He added that McLaren had been working on a gearbox for Sauber and had been asked by Red Bull principal Christian Horner whether the Woking-based team could supply Toro Rosso if the Honda deal went ahead. Honda's F1 head Yusuke Hasegawa said there had been no formal talks with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso, although reports have indicated there were informal discussions at a high level.""I don't think so,"" he said when asked whether Toro Rosso might be in line for a Honda supply in 2018.

Good question,"" Abiteboul, the Renault Sport Racing managing director, told reporters at the Belgian Grand Prix.""We said we wanted to be extremely methodological and analytical about the way we were approaching things with Robert. It's not a PR exercise, it's something that we are taking very seriously and leaving the emotion aside.""We don't have all the answers that we potentially wanted to get from that test.""Formula One teams have limited testing opportunities, with Kubica appearing in Hungary during the first in-season test that is primarily aimed at giving up-and-coming youngsters experience.For him to test again before the end of the season, Renault will have to sideline one of their race drivers in Friday first practice at a grand prix weekend.""In a perfect world we would want to do more of this type of test to see if he can race again at the level that he and we would have wanted. It may or may not be possible, we will see,"" said Abiteboul.Pressed further on what specific questions the team needed answering, Abiteboul said Renault - who have also been linked to Toro Rosso's Spaniard Carlos Sainz - had access to information that the public and media did not.""It's various things to do to be coming back into a racing car at this level,"" he added. ""A car that is extremely different to the car he has been driving six or seven years ago, and the (2012) car he drove at a test in Le Castellet.""So without going into too much detail, you can see what it could involve to go one step further.""Testing in isolation, private test with one car, in controlled elements without rain or first lap action that you can always encounter - all of that needs to be factored into the decision of pursuing or not pursuing.""We would all like Robert to be back, but it has to make sense.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He said that for potential buyers of electric cars all available financial help could add up to around 10,000 euros ($11,750) per vehicle.The exact amount of incentives, which will come in addition to existing government sweeteners for e-car buyers, will be decided and paid by the carmakers depending on the model of the vehicle exchanged for an old car, the spokesman of Austrian car importers association Guenther Kerle said.The Transport Ministry said representatives of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Kia, Ford,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Porsche, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Audi, Seat, Skoda, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Motors and Opel attended the meeting.VW, Mercedes, Renault and possibly BMW will undertake the software updates, and the others will just take part in the incentives program, the ministry said.German politicians and car bosses agreed earlier this month to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to try to repair the industry's battered reputation. However, environmentalists said the plan - almost two years after Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests - was too little, too late.The Austrian software update, which would take until spring next year and which carmakers say can reduce toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 25-30 percent, is the same as in Germany, Kerle said.Critics of the German plan have said software updates would only result in a cut of about 2-3 percent of emissions.Leichtfried and Kerle said there was no agreement on hardware updates, but that this would be discussed at future meetings.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Software firm NuTonomy, which works with several car companies including  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), had said it planned to launch commercial service next year, without being more specific on timing. Iagnemma in an interview said he hoped paid self-driving rides would start in the second quarter, although it could be the third or fourth.NuTonomy also plans to launch a test service with U.S. ride service firm Lyft in Boston later this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nothing that happened recently changed it.""I think Formula E at this point is in many ways a combination of a street party for fans and sponsors and auto companies.""For sponsors it is pursuing a corporate identification with a cause they like, for automotive companies R+D (research and development) and a technology they think will be a bigger part of their future. I’m not sure those things connect yet to make it a sport.""Porsche said on Friday it was quitting the top tier of Le Mans sportscar racing and the World Endurance Championship (WEC) after this season.Mercedes, whose Formula One team has dominated the championship for the past three years and plans to do so for some time yet, is leaving the German Touring Car (DTM) championship at the end of next year.Citroen,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Jaguar, BMW, Audi and India's Mahindra are already involved in Formula E.Carey said Formula One, a world championship that has been going since 1950 and represents the pinnacle of motorsport with glamour teams like Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and McLaren, appealed to fans in a different way.""We have state-of-the-art technology but we’re first and foremost a great sport, with great heroes doing incredible things that are awe-inspiring and with fans around the world that are passionately loving the sport,"" said the American.Carey took over at the helm of Formula One in January, following the takeover by U.S.-based Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA), with former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone moved aside into an undefined 'emeritus' role.Since then the moustachoied businessman has focused on a more fan-friendly approach, developing previously untapped digital strategies and building marketing and social media platforms.CITY EVENTSA recent free F1 Live event in central London, before the British Grand Prix, drew a large and enthusiastic crowd with drivers taking their cars onto the city streets for demonstration runs.That has been more Formula E territory, with the electric series staging races in cities such as Paris, Berlin and New York with the final races of the season in Montreal this Saturday and Sunday.Many of the Formula E drivers have raced previously in Formula One, with limited success, but the arrival of Porsche and Mercedes could see more high-profile drivers competing in the future.The cars are currently unable to complete a race on one charge, with drivers having to pit and switch cars, and with none of the engine noise associated with grand prix cars.Television viewing figures and crowd attendances are a fraction of those watching Formula One, while it is significantly cheaper to run a team, with budgets as low as $15 million compared to $300 million a year in F1 and WEC.""We’re delivering an incredibly exciting product that captures people’s imagination and passion with great stars,"" said Carey.

Britain's FTSE fell 0.5 percent, while export-orientated German blue-chips, lately penalized by a strong euro, fell 0.7 percent.""Weighing on the markets is not only disappointing results from Amazon and the strong euro, seasonally we are also nearing the end of July where traders like to take some profits,"" City of London Markets trader Markus Huber said.The STOXX is set to end the month down 0.3 percent, with a weekly fall of 0.5 percent.""However the overall picture remains fine, the euro zone economy seems to be powering ahead nicely,"" Huber said.Data from France showed that the economy in the euro zone's second-largest economy grew an expected 0.5 percent, helped by a surge in exports.Turning to company results,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategists said the earnings season was picking up with strong beats in the energy, telecoms and financial sectors while consumer, utilities and industrials stocks have seen net misses.According to Thomson Reuters IBES data, almost 40 percent of companies in the MSCI Europe index have reported results with 52 percent beating earnings estimates and 7 percent matching them. Second-quarter earnings growth is expected 19.7 percent.Deutsche said just last week earnings beats were fewer than half of the companies that had reported.While no sector was in positive territory, banks were a weak spot, led lower by a 3.7-percent drop in UBS, the world's biggest asset manager, after results which Baader Helvea said were relatively soft.

It also crosses into the defense sector, where many national governments prefer to wield influence over ownership.The Italian state-owned shipbuilder Fincantieri (MI:FCT) had reached an agreement in May to pay 79.5 million euros ($93.20 million) for two-thirds of STX France, which is being sold because of the collapse of its South Korean parent, STX.This week it rejected a French government proposal to settle for 50-50 ownership instead.That prompted the French state, which had a minority stake, to exercise pre-emption rights to buy out other shareholders before those rights expire at the end of the month, in effect giving Paris more time to come up with another solution.""This decision is in line with the economic strategy that we want to build with the president of the Republic and the prime minister,"" Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire told a news conference.""We want to free up France's exceptional productive capacities and protect our strategic interests,"" he said, adding that the 50-50 ownership offer was still on the table and that he would visit Rome on Tuesday.While Italy's government warmly welcomed the election of Macron in May, viewing the pro-European centrist as someone who could help Rome on an array of issues, the STX move added to other decisions that have upset it. Macron's talks this week with Libyan leaders irritated Rome, which had previously taken the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former North African colony, and was already disappointed by the new president's migration policies.""INCOMPREHENSIBLE""The STX nationalization also goes to the heart of Italy's long-held view that French companies' acquisitions on its territory are a one-way street.Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Industry Minister Carlo Calenda called France's decision to nationalise the shipyard ""grave and incomprehensible"".""Nationalism and protectionism are not an acceptable basis for establishing relations between two great European countries,"" they said in a joint statement.The prospect of a Fincantieri takeover had raised fears in France about jobs at the Saint-Nazaire site, and the government was also concerned about the strategic importance of the yard, the only one in the country big enough to build aircraft carriers and other large warships.""The Saint-Nazaire shipyards are not destined to remain under state control,"" Le Maire said. ""The pre-emption decision is temporary and should give us the time to negotiate in the best conditions.""The decision, which was welcomed by French politicians of all political stripes, flies in the face of any expectations that Macron, who in his former post as economy minister sought to liberalise swathes of the economy, would break with the French state's tradition of intervention in business.Even while economy minister, Macron forced through a shareholder vote that increased the government's power over carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA).

The brand's quarterly operating profit margin also leapt to 4.4 percent from 2.9 percent a year ago, beating a 2020 target of at least 4 percent, though still lagging peers such as PSA Peugeot Citroen and  Renault  (PA:RENA).""I am firmly convinced that our financial footing is adequate to cope with the transformation in the automotive industry and topics of the future,"" finance chief Frank Witter said, a day after Britain announced a ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 to reduce pollution.In another sign that VW is on the mend, it did not announce any further provisions related to its cheating of U.S. diesel emissions tests. The group has to date set aside 22.6 billion euros to cover fines, compensation and vehicle refits. VW's recovery, however, has been clouded by news that European and German regulators are investigating allegations of decades-long collusion between VW and other German carmakers. VW played down the controversy after a special supervisory board meeting on Wednesday, saying cooperation on technical issues was a common industry practice. It declined to comment on allegations of anti-competitive conduct. VW shares were 1.3 percent lower at 134.85 euros at 0835 GMT, with German rivals Daimler and BMW down 0.7 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.""VW results are in line with expectations. But auto shares will remain under pressure over the cartel allegations,"" said NordLB analyst Frank Schwope who has a ""buy"" rating on VW stock.""VW could face a single-digit billion-euro fine if the allegations turn out to be true,"" he added. The group stuck to its guidance for return on sales for 2017 of between 6 and 7 percent, after reaching 6.7 percent in 2016, and for sales volumes to moderately exceed year-ago levels.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Shares of Europe's leading carmakers fell on Monday following news that EU anti-trust regulators were investigating possible cartel action amongst them, in the latest probe of a sector whose reputation has been sullied by emissions cheating.While analysts do not see more massive fines emerging from these investigations and still expect the coming quarter's earnings reports to be relatively solid, investors appear to be steering clear of the sector.Broadly, earnings expectations for the coming quarter are upbeat and valuations, at less than eight times forward earnings, remain well below their long-term averages, according to Thomson Reuters data. But this has not been enough to tempt investors concerned about the investigations amid a widespread consumer backlash against diesel.""In my numbers and from what I’ve seen in consensus, we are going to see very decent numbers. I am afraid that this will be completely overshadowed by the negative news flow,"" said Georges Dieng, an autos analyst at Natixis.""Frankly who would have thought of a cartel? It’s the kind of risk you simply can’t quantify, so you think you’d be better off moving to another sector with more visibility and when the dust settles you can come back.""A strengthening euro <EUR=>, which has dented appetite for export-oriented sectors in recent weeks, has put the brakes on earnings forecast upgrades for autos, which have enjoyed a stellar run over the past year on the back of rebounding sales in China and as a European economic recovery gained traction.European autos' shares are down 1.6 percent in 2017, putting them among the worst performing sectors across the market. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares are the biggest laggards, down more than 7 percent with rival BMW (DE:BMWG) flirting with losses for the year after Monday's slide.""With the allegations as yet far from nefarious, we do not see justification for a new record EU cartel fine,"" said Exane's Stuart  Pearson  (LON:PSON), a top-ranked analyst on Daimler according to Thomson Reuters data, in a note to clients.""However, more ugly details could yet emerge, leaving German OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) - and the EU auto sector - still firmly in the sin bin for now,"" Pearson warned.EMISSIONS SCANDALSentiment around auto makers that have invested heavily in diesel has suffered since the first allegations of emissions cheating at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015.""The emissions scandal popped up with Volkswagen and now we have investigations into all the European OEMs,"" said Michael Punzet, autos analyst at DZ Bank.Investigations into carmakers multiplied from early this year when French and German prosecutors began probing  Renault  (PA:RENA), PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) over suspected diesel-emissions cheating. The companies deny any wrongdoing. In May, the U.S. government filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Italian carmaker of illegal use of software to bypass emission controls. Jefferies analysts estimated the maximum possible fines, capped under EU rules at 10 percent of group annual turnover: BMW could be made to pay a maximum of 9 billion euros, Daimler 16 billion and Volkswagen 24 billion.Some analysts, however, still see the valuation argument as compelling enough to stick with autos.Bernstein equity strategists pointed out the sector trades at more than one standard deviation below its historical average on price-to-book, and large valuation discounts have in the past been linked with strong future outperformance.Earlier on Monday analysts at the brokerage upped their allocation to autos in their regional portfolio.Daimler is scheduled to report second quarter earnings on Wednesday, followed by Volkswagen on Thursday and BMW next week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That’s the way I see it,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""And if Jo does go, there’s only Lewis left. ""And the rumors that go around about him, you’re never really sure what he’s going to be doing. I’m there and I’m ready if F1 needs another British driver.""With Renault incumbent Palmer yet to score in nine races, a vacancy looks likely.Whether Rowland's name will be picked from the hat is another matter, and the odds already appear more stacked against him than they were a few months ago.That is because former team favorite Robert Kubica is suddenly back in contention, after partially severing his forearm in a rally crash in 2011.Rowland recognizes the threat from the Polish race winner is real, but hopes he might at least get a chance for a head-to-head test.""Kubica’s had a long time off now and with his arm and everything I don’t know exactly where he’s at in terms of performance. I’d like to think that if you put me in a car (test) with him, I’d be there or thereabouts,"" he said.ON THE LIMITWhile Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull can place budding talent with customer teams, Renault do not have such an option. And timing is everything.""I’m probably on the limit now to get in. There’s not too many more years left,"" recognized Rowland, who is currently second in the Formula Two championship and 49 points behind Monegasque Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) academy driver Charles Leclerc.""You have to have a bit of luck, and I’m aware of that. All I can do is keep pushing and keep doing the right things and fingers crossed that someone believes and gives me a go.""Winner of the 2011 McLaren Autosport BRDC award, which secured a Formula One test with McLaren, Rowland has always had more talent than money.Like Hamilton, plenty of parental sacrifices have been made to help him on the ladder.""We had no carpet in our living room for about four or five years,"" he said.""Unfortunately I lost my dad when I was about 18. My mum still pays off his credit card bills from when I was karting at 12. ""It was a big strain on my family and my dad put a lot into getting me where I am today. It was his dream for me to get to Formula One as well.""More than a decade ago, as a budding karter, Rowland went to Silverstone when Hamilton was racing in GP2 -- now Formula Two -- and got to know the future champion.""I remember just thinking wow, if I could be in his position and just racing in GP2,"" he said.""But your goals change. Now I’m keen that the next time I go there -- not this year but the following year -- I want to be an F1 driver and I want to be who the people are coming to support.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

795,"Jul 12, 2017 07:52AM ET",Trump and Macron may not be an odd couple after all,nan,"By John Irish and Ayesha RascoePARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's relationship with Emmanuel Macron got off to an awkward start, with a jaw-clenching handshake at a summit in Brussels before the French president rebuked the U.S. leader for his stance on climate change. The two men would appear to have little in common. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist elected on a pledge to ""make America great again"" who is unpredictable on foreign policy. Macron, 39, is an ardent European integrationist more than three decades younger who sees himself as an honest broker of international relations.Trump's visit to Paris this week, to celebrate 100 years since U.S. troops entered World War One on the side of France and Britain, follows bruising talks on trade and climate policy that pitted him against leaders from the world's major economies at a G20 summit last weekend.In Paris, Trump will seek common ground on diplomatic and military endeavors. Both he and Macron have a political interest in building rapport, and both have a corporate background that may help underpin their relationship.Trump could use a friend overseas. His preference for a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has unsettled traditional allies in Europe and left the U.S. president appearing isolated among world leaders. ""Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don't like, such as on climate, but we can deal with it in two ways: we can say, 'We are not going to talk to you,' or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle,"" government spokesman Christophe Castaner told French news channel LCI. ""Macron is symbolically offering Trump his hand.""POLITICAL OUTSIDERSTrump and Macron are political outsiders, the American a real estate mogul, his French counterpart a former investment banker. Both love a good deal, demand tangible results rather than lofty ambitions, and have a penchant for showmanship.Like Macron, Trump will be looking for common ground.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One returning from the G20 meeting in the German city of Hamburg, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Trump and Macron enjoyed a ""great"" relationship.""You know, Macron and the president have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same,"" Cohn said.Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. In hard-fought negotiations in Germany, Macron tried to soften U.S. language on climate policy. Cohn played down talk of tensions with Macron over climate policy. He said he expected meetings in Paris on military and security matters as well as ""a long bilateral meeting between the two men"".Having reshaped their countries' political landscapes, both now have certain shared objectives, making crushing Islamic State and countering global terrorism a leading priority.It is unclear whether the leaders will address thornier issues such as policy toward Iran, possible American tariffs on steel and Russia sanctions legislation in the U.S. Congress that might derail a 9.5 billion euro ($10.9 billion) gas pipe project in which France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) has a stake.The United States and France hold differing views on Iran.On a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. During the U.S. presidential race, he threatened to tear up an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program, branding it ""the worst deal ever negotiated"".So far Trump has stopped short of killing an accord that has allowed French companies including planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR), oil major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and automobile manufacturers  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) to sign initial deals.'A WIN-WIN FOR BOTH'Just as Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin with a meeting at the gilded Versailles palace of France's former monarchy, Trump will bask in a Bastille Day ceremony on Thursday laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers parading down the Champs Elysees.For Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy at a time European diplomats say Washington lacks direction.""The visit is a win-win for both,"" said one French diplomat. ""Trump remains unchallenged and gets the grandeur that he enjoys. Macron remains unchallenged and gets a no-fuss picture with the leader of the 'free world'"".Macron is concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner, French diplomats said. Moreover, he senses an opportunity to sway U.S. thinking and elevate the role of France, a nuclear power and permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East, they added.France is the second-biggest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition in Syria, and French officials have expressed fears that the United States has no clear vision beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State.It is one reason, the diplomats say, that in his first two months as president, Macron has sought warmer ties with the Kremlin, just as Trump is left hamstrung in his relations with Moscow by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump win and possible collusion with Russia by people close to him.""The Russians are pleased to have a grown-up to talk to in Europe,"" a second French diplomat said.Daniel Fried, an expert on U.S.-European relations who served under presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Trump had nothing to gain politically at home or abroad by isolating himself. ""By reaching out to the French I suspect he hopes to show he can be a viable actor on the world stage.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

802,"Jun 22, 2017 09:00AM ET",Tech industry asks who will lead Toshiba's motley white knights,nan,"By Makiko YamazakiTOKYO (Reuters) - A hastily-assembled group of investors looks set to win the bid for Toshiba Corp's prized memory chip business, but a lack of clear leadership or industry clout is raising questions about who will take tough decisions about strategy and investment.After a fiercely contested, months-long auction, Toshiba on Wednesday said a consortium of Japanese government investors and private equity firm Bain Capital was the preferred bidder, aiming to seal a deal worth some $18 billion by next week.The sale will provide much-needed cash for the electronics giant, which has been forced to divest part of its chip business to cover billions of dollars in cost over-runs at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear power business Westinghouse. But the group of awkward bedfellows could struggle in the cash-intensive and competitive tech sector, famous for hairpin swings in consumer demand and a brutally small margin of assembly-line error, senior industry participants said.Flagging a lack of industry expertise and cultural differences, the disparate consortium would likely need to bring in a leader from outside to run the core unit to be spun off from the world's eighth largest semiconductor maker, they said.""Chip chiefs must be someone like Carlos Ghosn, who exercised strong leadership in Nissan's turnaround,"" said Tsugio Makimoto, former Hitachi Ltd chief engineer, referring to the Brazilian-born boss credited with reviving the fortunes of car makers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan.""It will be hard for a patched-together group like the Japan-U.S.-South Korea consortium to achieve such leadership.""STATE INTERVENTIONJapanese policymakers are notoriously reluctant to let big business failures hurt the wider economy, but state-led investors have a patchy history of turning around troubled corporates in the country.In addition to Bain, the group includes state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) and the Development Bank of Japan. South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc and the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc are in talks to provide financing.A senior Toshiba executive said that anti-trust concerns around SK Hynix's memory operations mean it would not participate in the management of the chip business.""No one in the consortium knows the management of the memory chip business as SK Hynix would stay in the background,"" the executive said.    SK Hynix declined to comment. Still, the group is seen by many analysts as being the most likely suitor as it would automatically gain an implicit stamp of approval from the Japanese government, which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control.Toshiba is the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash memory chips that are increasingly in demand from electronics makers as consumers look for ever larger long-term data storage.MIXED RESULTSINCJ's past record in bringing Japanese electronic component makers back from the brink and aiding wider restructuring in the sector has yielded mixed results.The group, a public-private partnership, five years ago cobbled together Japan Display from the ailing display units of Sony Corp (T:6758), Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba.The liquid crystal display maker has posted three consecutive years of losses and is now considering deeper restructuring despite receiving 75 billion yen ($685 million) in investment from INCJ in December.On the other hand, INCJ's bailout of Renesas Electronics Corp in 2013 is considered a win, with its share price more than trebling to trade around 1,000 yen, from 300 yen at the time of its rescue.However, Kuninori Hamaguchi, a semiconductor expert who is currently external audit and supervisory board member at Oki Electric Industry Co, warns Toshiba's investment requirements are incomparably greater than those of INCJ's past rescues.""INCJ's investment in Renesas is considered a success. Their strategy worked because they narrowed down their target to the automotive industry and focused on automotive chips,"" Hamaguchi said.""But Toshiba's memory business is massive in scale. Flash memory will be central to data servers in coming years. It would be a capital battle.""An INCJ spokeswoman said the fund plans to proceed with detailed negotiations to clinch a deal as a consortium, but declined to comment further. The Development Bank of Japan declined to comment, while representatives Bain Capital could not be reached.A spokeswoman said Toshiba Memory plans to provide sufficient information to the consortium to allow the new management to make decisions in a timely and appropriate manner. NOT OVER YETMeanwhile, the consortium's bid is not over the finishing line yet.Rival bidder  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) says Toshiba is in breach of its joint venture contracts. The companies jointly operate a flash memory chip plant in Japan. Western Digital has requested a U.S. court injunction and a hearing is scheduled for mid-July.Terry Gou, the outspoken founder of Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and another bidder in the auction, still saw scope for his company's bid to succeed given some of the uncertainties around the consortium's structure.He also questioned the Japanese government's involvement in the auction, contrasting it with his own experience of raising investment. ""I haven't gotten any government money,"" Gou told reporters at his company's annual general meeting on Thursday. ""I haven't asked for a single dollar from the Taiwan government.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

At the moment, most global jurisdictions do not expressly authorise vehicles to operate on regular roads without a driver.""It doesn't just depend on us,"" he said.

Honda discovered on Sunday that the virus had affected networks across Japan, North America, Europe, China and other regions, a spokeswoman said, despite efforts to secure its systems in mid-May when the virus caused widespread disruption at plants, hospitals and shops worldwide.Production at other plants operated by the automaker had not been affected, and regular operations had resumed at the Sayama plant on Tuesday, she said.The spread of the WannaCry ransomware which locked up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries has slowed since last month, but security experts have warned that new versions of the worm may strike. Rival automakers  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) were also affected by the virus last month, when the automaking alliance companies stopped production at plants in Japan, Britain, France, Romania and India.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies.More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday.""We are making good progress,"" Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo. ""2018 will be a strong year for VW,"" he said, adding a new product always helped margins.VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent.Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.""The most important thing is the product offensive in coming months,"" Diess said.Wolfsburg-based VW is counting on the larger, technology-packed Polo model to revive its sluggish sales in the core European market where the brand's deliveries slid 0.2 percent in the January-to-May period to 726,000 cars.The new Polo, priced from 12,975 euros ($14,500) and due to hit showrooms in October, will be the main volume product VW launches this year, preceding the all-new T-Roc, a Golf-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) which is due out later in 2017.A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed.The advent of the new Polo will intensify the struggle for dominance in Europe's crowded subcompact segment where the VW model is going up against a redesigned Ford (N:F) Fiesta and an upgraded Renault (PA:RENA) Clio, all vying for the top spot.Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily.European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS.Registrations of the Peugeot (PA:PEUP) 208 model may surge a fifth to 277,067 cars, IHS said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA). ""In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry,"" the industry group said in a statement.European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms.The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain.May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki (T:7269) and Toyota (T:7203), up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), up 14 percent. Sales from the  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand. France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group (PA:PEUP), whose sales increased 4.8 percent.Sales at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent.The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent.All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent. In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

812,"Jun 13, 2017 11:11AM ET",Exclusive: Renault-Nissan considers hidden bonus plan - documents,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan alliance bankers have drawn up plans designed to channel millions of euros in additional, undisclosed bonuses to Chairman Carlos Ghosn and other managers via a specially created service company, according to documents seen by Reuters.Under the preliminary proposal,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan (T:7201) and Mitsubishi (T:7211) would pay the Dutch-registered company a share of new synergies from their carmaking alliance, set to top 5.5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) next year.The funds would be passed on as cash and stock bonuses to ""encourage executives to pursue synergy opportunities"", according to a presentation by Ardea Partners, an investment banking firm advising Ghosn on closer alliance integration.Renault-Nissan spokeswoman Catherine Loubier said: ""This article is not based on any information provided by the alliance or its member companies, and no such decisions have been made.""Loubier declined to comment further or respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the proposal and the relationship with Ardea Partners, which also declined to comment.Brazilian-born Ghosn, 63, is in open conflict with the French state, Renault's biggest shareholder, whose opposition to his CEO pay package was instrumental to its symbolic rejection in a non-binding vote at last year's shareholder meeting. His combined 15.6 million euros in Renault-Nissan pay amounted to the third-biggest haul among French CAC 40 company bosses.In response, Renault cut Ghosn's variable pay component by 20 percent and clarified bonus criteria. Shareholders will have their say again at the 2017 general meeting on Thursday, in a vote that has now become binding under French law.Renault shares fell more than 3 percent after this report was published and were down 2.7 percent at 83.69 euros as of 1453 GMT. Nissan had earlier closed 0.2 percent lower in Tokyo.Ghosn, who is also chairman of Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors and the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organisation, said in February the government's near-20 percent Renault stake was blocking a full tie-up.The alliance bonus plan would seek to encourage Renault and its 44 percent-owned partner Nissan to operate more like a merged company without the need for actual ownership changes.It would create a new pool of executive pay - on top of existing bonus plans at the allied carmakers and Mitsubishi, in which Nissan took a controlling 34 percent stake last year.If implemented, the plan would likely draw criticism from some investors already concerned about compensation, governance issues and an ongoing French criminal probe into allegations of systematic Renault diesel emissions fraud. The company has denied any wrongdoing.NO DISCLOSUREUnder the proposal seen by Reuters, the carmakers would pay in 8 percent of each annual increase in synergies achieved. In a hypothetical year where new projects with Mitsubishi saved 1 billion euros, 80 million would be added to the bonus pot.One-third of total awards would be reserved for the six top alliance roles - the chairman and CEO at each carmaker - of which four are currently occupied by Ghosn.The new Dutch private limited company, or BV, would be wholly owned by an independent foundation, the presentation states, ""avoiding related-party issues"" that would require compensation to be disclosed to the manufacturers' shareholders. It would also escape French payroll taxes.""The amounts paid through the service contracts would be disclosed each year in the respective accounts of the (alliance) members - although the amounts paid to each participant would not have to be legally disclosed,"" it says.The incentive plan has Ghosn's backing, according to an accompanying memo dating from early June. ""The scheme is still being worked out in detail,"" it says. Renault and Nissan are due to update mid-term plans and integration goals later this year.London-based Ardea Partners was founded last year by Christopher Cole, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker who is close to Ghosn, as a private investment banking firm providing ""strategic and financial advice to CEOs, founders and boards of directors of leading global enterprises facing complex challenges"".In 2013, Cole and his Goldman teams worked on a full Renault-Nissan deal study piloted by Ghosn and a group of alliance managers, known internally as Project  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT). It recommended a merger, but Ghosn instead unveiled a purely operational integration push early the following year.""It's an Ardea Partners-wide policy to never speak to the press,"" Managing Director Robert Falzon said when contacted for this story. ""Our chairman is very focused on this.""SUCCESSIONThe plan to reward cooperation may indicate that Ghosn sees little chance of a merger to cement the alliance he built and has run for 12 years, as he moves to hand over some powers.In April, Ghosn stepped aside as Nissan CEO, though he continues to oversee operations as chairman.Renault-Nissan is recruiting a new second-in-command, with several alliance managers in contention, Reuters reported on June 7. Senior Toyota (T:7203) executive Didier Leroy is also being considered, sources said this week.Furthermore, the bonus plan would increase pay for the chairman roles from which Ghosn is expected to continue directing alliance strategy for years, whether or not his Renault CEO contract is renewed in 2018.""It makes perfect sense,"" said one senior Paris investment banker when told about the proposal. ""The question is whether he can manage the storm this is going to create.""Pressure on Ghosn over pay had been easing ahead of Thursday's shareholder meeting, following the Renault pay concessions and his exit from the Nissan CEO role.ISS, an influential shareholder adviser that opposed Ghosn's pay last year, is urging clients to back his package, which may be enough to overcome the usual government opposition.($1 = 0.8911 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The South Korean automaker said it would also launch an electric version of the sporty-looking Kona next year and a smaller SUV and a large SUV by 2020.This comes at a time when Hyundai looks set to miss its sales target for a third straight year due to the unpopularity of its mainstay small sedans and political tensions between Beijing and Seoul that have battered sales in China, the company's biggest market. Hyundai, which together with its affiliate Kia (KS:000270) is the world's No.5 automaker, previously sold subcompact SUVs only in emerging markets, missing out on strong growth in the segment in South Korea, the United States and Europe. The subcompact SUV is the top-performing segment globally, growing at an annual average of 46 percent from 2010 to 2016, Hyundai said, citing IHS Automotive data. ""Even as the global SUV market is nearing saturation, we believe that extra small or small SUVs have more room for growth than large SUVs,"" Hyundai Motor Co Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun said during a launch event near Seoul. The automaker launched the Kona in South Korea on Tuesday, and said it would roll out the small SUV in Europe in August and the United States in December. It aims to sell over 200,000 of the vehicles globally next year. The Kona will compete with Nissan's (T:7201) Juke, Toyota Motor's (T:7203) C-HR and Renault's (PA:RENA) Captur that is sold as QM3 in South Korea. Hyundai and Kia in January said they aimed to increase global sales by 5 percent this year, but their combined sales fell 7 percent over January to May, hit by slowing Chinese and U.S. sales. ""Our sales plan has suffered a setback, but we will use this as an opportunity to overhaul our products,"" said Chung, the only son of Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo.He also said Hyundai would accelerate cooperation with technology firms like Cisco (O:CSCO), Baidu (O:BIDU) and Uber [UBER.UL] on connected or self-drivng cars. ""Simply making good quality cars is not enough,"" Chung said.When asked about overseas acquisitions, Chung said Hyundai currently had no plans to buy other carmakers. Kia will join Hyundai in the launch of the former's subcompact SUV, Stonic, starting next month.Hyundai Motor shares ended up 1.2 percent, versus the broader market's (KS11) 0.7 percent rise.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

818,"Jun 09, 2017 07:40PM ET",London Bridge attackers had tried to hire 8.3 ton truck: police,nan,"By Michael HoldenLONDON (Reuters) - The three Islamists who killed eight people after driving a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then attacking nearby revelers had initially tried to hire a 7.5 tonne (8.3 ton) truck, the head of the UK capital's counter-terrorism unit said on Friday.Commander Dean Haydon also revealed that the men had a stockpile of petrol bombs in the back of their van and carried out their deadly attack with pink ceramic knives. Officers also discovered a Koran in their safe house, opened at a page on martyrdom.The discoveries, especially of the plan to hire a truck, suggested more could have been killed.""Getting hold of a 7.5 tonne lorry - the effects could have been even worse,"" Haydon told reporters. Although Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, Haydon said there was no evidence the attackers - Pakistani-born Briton Khuram Butt, Italian Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane who had links to Libya, Morocco and Ireland - were directed by anyone else, either in Britain or abroad.""We're not looking for a wider network,"" said Haydon, head of London's Counter Terrorism Command, adding that officers were still trying to piece together how the three men had met. ""How did they know each other? They are a diverse bunch,"" he said. Haydon provided unusually extensive details of last Saturday's attack, the deadliest in London since suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's transport network in 2005.RINGLEADEROn Saturday morning, Butt, who Haydon said was believed to be the ringleader, tried to rent a 7.5 tonne truck but did not provided payment details. It was not clear why he could not pay, or if he lacked the necessary license to drive such a vehicle. But his attempt echoed last July's attack in Nice, France, when a 19-tonne truck was driven into crowds, killing 86 people.Shortly before 1700 GMT, Butt received a text message confirming his hire of a  Renault  (PA:RENA) van instead.At about 1730 GMT, the men drove to pick up the van before heading to Zaghba's home in east London. At 1838 GMT they left and two hours later the van reached London Bridge which they drove along twice before targeting pedestrians on the sidewalk on their third run.Three people on the bridge were struck and killed by the van, believed to have been driven by Butt, before the men abandoned the vehicle and began to attack people in bars and restaurants in the nearby bustling Borough Market area.The men were armed with identical 12-inch (30cm) pink ceramic knives, strapped to their wrists with leather bound around the handle. They were also wearing fake suicide belts - plastic water bottles wrapped in duct tape.Eight minutes after police were alerted, armed officers arrived at the scene and fired 46 rounds, killing all three men. Their victims were three French nationals, two Australians, a Canadian, a Spaniard and a Briton.In the attackers' van detectives found 13 wine bottles, filled with lighter fuel with rags wrapped round them to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs. There were also two blow torches which Haydon thought could have been used to light the homemade bombs as part of a possible secondary attack.""They were still fairly close to the van. There is a possibility that they could have come back,"" Haydon said.There were also office chairs, a suitcase and two bags of gravel which Haydon said might have been to add weight or to act as a cover story for their activities to friends and family. He said Redouane's home, an apartment in Barking, east London, was the men's safe house where they put their plot together and prepared the attack. There they found an English-language copy of the Koran which had been left open on a page describing martyrdom, along with other items linked to their attack.Haydon said since last Saturday they had taken 262 statements from people from 19 different countries and numerous international inquiries were ongoing relating to the attackers and the victims.CRITICISMBritish police and security services were criticized after it emerged that they had known about Butt, who featured in a TV documentary entitled ""Jihadis Next Door"", in which he joined a group unfurling an Islamic State (IS) flag in a park. Haydon acknowledged that Butt had links to al Muhajiroun, a banned group headed by cleric Anjem Choudary. He was jailed last year for encouraging support of IS, which has been linked to numerous militant plots in Britain and abroad.Butt was also arrested for fraud last October but was about to be told by prosecutors he would face no further action.""We will be looking at intelligence and our processes, and asking ourselves the question: 'Could we have prevented such an attack?',"" Haydon said. ""There is nothing that I'm seeing at the moment that suggested that we got that wrong.""Police have installed security barriers running alongside the sidewalks at eight bridges across the River Thames, and Haydon said similar protection was being considered at other locations.Police were also reviewing security at ""iconic sites"", crowded places and major events, and refreshing advice to theaters, bars, shopping centers and sports venues.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

819,"Jun 07, 2017 01:24PM ET",Renault plans foray into energy market with mega battery,nan,"By Christoph Steitz and Edward TaylorFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan is drawing up plans to build a 100 megawatt power storage plant in Europe, sources told Reuters, hoping to give electric car batteries a second life in a project that could eventually compete with utility companies.Like rival Tesla's energy storage business, the Renault-Nissan move underscores its desire to cultivate a second-hand battery market while encouraging the development of energy infrastructure that works for electric cars.The Renault-Nissan alliance plant, which has yet to be built, would be big enough to power 120,000 homes, or supplant the role of a gas- or coal-fired power station in meeting peak electricity demand on the grid, the sources said. Rather than generating power, a storage plant charges up in times of excess supply and sells electricity back to the grid when needed. Proponents say such plants can play a key role in smoothing out unpredictable wind and solar power generation.Renault-Nissan is working in partnership with energy storage specialist The Mobility House on the mega battery which would be assembled from new or used electric car batteries, one of the sources said.""We're working with The Mobility House on several programs including a major energy storage project that is currently still in the study phase,""  Renault  (PA:RENA) spokeswoman Celine Farissier said, declining to give further details. Makers of electric cars stand to benefit from the creation of a market for used lithium-ion batteries that can no longer power vehicles to drive far enough. Higher second-hand battery values could help bring down the cost of electric cars and mega batteries are one avenue for recycling the power cells.Nissan, 44 percent-owned by French alliance partner Renault, has already built a back-up power storage system for the Amsterdam Arena, which is home to soccer club Ajax, in a first partnership with the German start-up. Marcus Fendt, its managing director, said the Munich-based company was working on a 100 MW plant with partners he declined to identify, citing confidentiality agreements. He said the studies were aimed at determining where to build the plant.Locations and end markets under consideration for the Renault-Nissan plant include Germany, which is suitable because of its high energy prices and its shift from nuclear to renewable energy, as well as the Netherlands, sources said.CARMAKING UTILITIESRenault-Nissan studied an existing power storage project in the United States before embarking on its own plan to recycle electric car batteries.California's Public Utilities commission selected a 100 MW battery storage system to replace a natural-gas power plant providing electricity for Southern California Edison (A:SCE_pe) in the Los Angeles area.Large batteries can help stabilize the primary reserve electricity market, which is responsible for ensuring the grid has at least 50 Hertz. Carmakers can also earn money competing with conventional power stations to guarantee the provision of electricity during periods of high demand or volatility. ""We forecast the combined market for electric passenger vehicles, electric buses and battery storage to increase eight-fold to over $200 billion by 2020, a five-year compound annual growth rate of more than 50 percent,"" Berenberg analysts said. With about 4 million electric cars expected to be on the roads by 2020, vehicle manufacturers looking at ways to recycle batteries, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which already sells everything from solar panels to batteries and electric cars.Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and China's BYD Co Ltd are also exploring so-called second-life storage projects with batteries.That includes partnerships such as the recent collaboration between BMW and Vattenfall (VATN.UL), in which the luxury automaker will deliver up to 1,000 lithium-ion batteries to the Swedish utility for storage projects this year.""What will end up happening is that BMW and Daimler will ... become utilities themselves,"" said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital LLP, a corporate advisor in the energy, power infrastructure and technology sectors.""They use Vattenfall now because they need to learn but I think the amount of batteries coming back will be so big that I think they'll end up engaging directly with the end customer themselves. And they've got the brand name to do that.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America.It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said.The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide ""a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand,"" said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer, in a media briefing.Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV (N:MBLY), which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies' statement said.French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev's chief performance officer. The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing. Initially, the vehicles will have ""safety"" drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added. Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions. Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates).Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries. The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA (PA:VIE), the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake.The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years.In May, German automaker BMW AG (DE:BMWG) announced that Delphi will join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

821,"Jun 07, 2017 05:47AM ET",Exclusive: Renault-Nissan seeks Ghosn heir to drive integration - sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn is recruiting a new operational second-in-command for the carmaking alliance, company sources told Reuters, in a move designed to prepare his own succession and advance the companies' integration.Under the plan, the currently separate chief competitive officer (CCO) roles at  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan (T:7201) would be fused into a single position at the 18-year-old alliance's helm, the sources said.Nissan Chief Performance Officer Jose Munoz and CCO Yasuhiro Yamauchi are seen internally as strong contenders, they said, along with Stefan Mueller, Munoz's counterpart at Renault.Ghosn, 63, aims to fill the new post later this year, backed by further steps to combine Renault and Nissan manufacturing, research and development and other key activities.""He's already preparing the next stage,"" one of the people said. ""The process is underway.""A Renault-Nissan spokeswoman declined to comment.Brazilian-born Ghosn recently stepped back from his role as Nissan chief executive officer but remains CEO at Renault, where his contract ends in 2018. He still serves as chairman of both carmakers as well as Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), controlled by Nissan through a 34 percent stake.Ghosn has repeatedly tussled with Renault's biggest shareholder, the French state, over the future of the company and its 44 percent stake in Nissan.For years, he sang the praises of a consensual, arm's length approach to cooperation - often invoking the long list of failed auto deals to explain why a merger was a bad idea. Renault and Nissan are currently targeting 5.5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) in joint savings, or 3.8 percent of combined sales.But the tone changed in February, when Ghosn suggested the carmakers would be ready for a full tie-up if only France sold its near-20 percent Renault holding.Nissan ""will not accept any move on capital structure as long as the French state remains a shareholder,"" Ghosn said as he presented Renault's 2016 earnings. ""The day the French state decides to get out, everything is open, and I can tell you it won't take too much time.""The new CCO hiring process began around the same time, the sources said, with senior executives at both companies vying for what is likely to be an internal appointment.Senior alliance appointments are beset by the same cultural and political sensitivities that have held back integration. Being neither French nor Japanese could be a diplomatic edge for Munoz or Mueller, respectively Spanish and German.Renault CCO Thierry Bollore is considered a long shot, the sources added. Bollore, 54, has played a prominent role in publicly defending the company against diesel fraud allegations that remain under investigation by French prosecutors.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa will likely stay in the role he inherited in April, with Ghosn also remaining Renault CEO ""for an initial period"". Ghosn, who has run Nissan since 1999 and its French parent since 2005, is expected to continue presiding over the alliance from one or more chairman roles.The other changes will see Renault and Nissan departments folded into alliance teams that were created in 2014 across four key areas, the same people said: manufacturing and supply chain; research and development; purchasing; and human resources.""We'll see convergence efforts in the same fields,"" said one. ""But they are stepping up a notch.""Renault shares were up 1 percent to 84.44 euros at 0939 GMT on Wednesday.

It really is Robert Kubica,"" the team added in a later post. ""Back in one of our cars after six years.""The test took place amid considerable secrecy, with no advance notice given to the media and little information provided about the reasons for the private test.""So why did we keep it quiet? It was a private test, for Robert,"" the team said, adding that the Pole had completed 115 laps with ""the biggest smile"" afterwards.Kubica, who in 2008 became the first Pole to win a Formula One race when he triumphed with BMW-Sauber in Canada, last drove a Formula One car with Renault in pre-season testing at the same circuit in February 2011.Renault have left and returned to the sport with their own team since then, with a current line-up of Germany's Nico Hulkenberg and Britain's Jolyon Palmer.The latter has yet to score a point in six races this season with increasing media speculation about his future ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix.Kubica's F1 career ended in the same month as his last test when he suffered severe arm, leg and hand injuries in a near-fatal crash during a minor rally in northern Italy that he had entered for fun.He had been one of the sport's brightest prospects before his accident, with a likely move to Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) on the horizon.Since his recovery he has competed in the world rally championship and tested other cars, including those used in Formula E and GP3.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He is chairman and chief executive of Renault as well as chairman of both Mitsubishi and Nissan, where he also served as CEO until earlier this year.""We believe an investigation is urgently needed to uphold the rights of Renault shareholders,"" CtW Investment Group Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger said.CtW, a branch of the U.S. union federation Change to Win, has been influential in pressing Tesla (O:TSLA) boss Elon Musk to add independent directors.The AMF said it had no immediate comment on the letter. A Renault spokesman could not be reached for comment.The letter said a creeping transfer of power to the Dutch-listed RNBV venture has been taking place since 2002 without ""adequate governance mechanisms or protections for Renault shareholders"" or any new regulatory scrutiny. The conflict of interest allegations partly echo criticisms leveled against Ghosn by the previous French government during his 2015 power struggle with then finance minister Emmanuel Macron - who was elected French president last month.The French state, Renault's biggest shareholder with nearly 20 percent, had indicated before the elections it would probably vote against Ghosn's pay from Renault and Nissan, which came to a combined 15.6 million euros ($17.5 million) last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It's how it goes sometimes."" ""I know how it feels, it's not a good feeling,"" reigning champion Nico Rosberg, who retired at the end of last year after years of battling Hamilton at Mercedes, consoled him as he conducted the post-race interviews on the finish straight. Australian Daniel Ricciardo took his second successive podium with third place for Red Bull.MINIMAL OVERTAKINGIn a race with plenty of sunshine and minimal overtaking, late crashes ensured the safety car made its traditional Monaco appearance.While Raikkonen led for the first 34 laps, the writing was on the wall at the pitstops with a consensus emerging already before the start that Ferrari would favor the championship leader.""It was a very tense race. I knew that (staying out) was the chance to win and I was able to use that window and come out ahead. After that I was able to control the gap behind,"" said Vettel.What had been a processional race, with the wider new cars making overtaking more difficult, turned into sudden drama with a collision between Jenson Button's McLaren and Pascal Wehrlein's Sauber at the tunnel entrance.Wehrlein's car was flipped on its side against the tire wall and fence, with the German driver trapped inside and marshals unable to do anything about it, after Button went down the inside in what looked like a wildly optimistic attempt to pass.Button parked his damaged car at the other end of the tunnel with the safety car deployed. Wehrlein's team mate Marcus Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) then plowed straight on into the barriers at the first corner with 13 laps remaining. Ricciardo gained his places on strategy, with Dutch team mate Max Verstappen venting his fury over the radio with some pithy language after discovering he was behind his team mate despite starting in front.Verstappen finished fifth, behind Valtteri Bottas for Mercedes, with Carlos Sainz sixth for Toro Rosso. Frenchman Romain Grosjean was eighth.Brazilian Felipe Massa was ninth for Williams and Denmark's Kevin Magnussen took the final point for Haas. Mexican Sergio Perez was 13th, ending his run of 15 successive points finishes for Force India.Former champions McLaren's hopes of a first point of the season had already disappeared 12 laps from the end when Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne, who had been 10th, crashed at the same place as Ericsson.Renault's Nico Hulkenberg was the first to retire, pulling over at the tunnel entrance with smoke coming out of the rear of his  Renault  (PA:RENA) on lap 16.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The complaint was filed in the federal court in Detroit.""These claims are baseless and we will vigorously defend ourselves,"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said.He added that the trucks comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards and California's own tough emissions standards.The lawsuit alleges violations of racketeering and consumer protection laws, and seeks remedies including possible refunds, restitution for lost resale value, and punitive damages.It adds to legal problems for Detroit-based GM, which has already paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches linked to 124 deaths.GM joins VW, which has admitted to cheating, and at least four other automakers whose diesel emissions have been scrutinized by regulators or consumers.They include Mercedes-Benz parent  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA),  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA)GM shares were down 74 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $32.46 in afternoon trading, after earlier falling as much as 3.8 percent.RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak estimated that one-eighth of GM's full-sized pickups have diesel engines, and said ""negative publicity"" from the lawsuit could steer prospective buyers to  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) or Fiat Chrysler's Ram division.EXCESS POLLUTANTSAccording to the lawsuit, ""on-road"" emissions testing conducted for the plaintiffs found that Duramax-engined trucks produced nitrogen oxide pollutants two to five times higher than allowed, and ""many times"" higher than gasoline-engined trucks.Modifying the engines to meet emissions standards would reduce performance, horsepower and fuel economy, the 184-page complaint said.Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] was also named as a defendant for having allegedly helped develop the defeat devices, in an ""unusually close"" collaboration with GM.Bosch spokeswoman Alissa Cleland said that company will not discuss matters being investigated or litigated.The named plaintiffs are Andrei Fenner of Mountain View, California and Joshua Herman of Sulphur, Louisiana.They said they would not have bought, or would have paid less for, their respective 2011 Sierra and 2016 Silverado trucks had they known about the alleged rigging.Their law firms include Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, which helped reach multibillion-dollar settlements for VW owners and dealers and has brought similar claims over GM's diesel-equipped Chevrolet Cruze.Hilliard Munoz Gonzales, which handles many GM ignition switch lawsuits, also represents the plaintiffs.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil lawsuit accusing Fiat Chrysler of using software on 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014 to evade emission standards.Fiat Chrysler has denied wrongdoing. It also faces a separate Justice Department criminal probe on emissions.The case is Fenner et al v General Motors LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, No. 17-11661.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Mercedes title rival Lewis Hamilton had been fastest before lunch.The German was the only driver to break the one minute 13 seconds barrier.Triple world champion Hamilton, six points behind after five races, was only eighth in the later practice with a lap of 1:13.873, more than a second off the pace.The Briton, last year's winner in Monaco, had produced a 1:13.425 effort in the morning, when Vettel had to settle for second best.Hamilton, whose Finnish teammate Valtteri Bottas ended the day 10th, is hoping to equal the 65 career pole positions of late boyhood idol Ayrton Senna in Saturday's qualifying.""We were good in P1 (first practice) but something went wrong in this session. We need to figure out why,"" said Hamilton. ""This afternoon, for whatever reasons, the tires weren't working. That's something we have to study and figure out to fix for Saturday.""The top six in the afternoon were all inside last year's pole position time of 1:13.622, set by Australian Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo.Ricciardo was second fastest on Thursday, 0.487 slower than his former teammate Vettel, in a boost for former champions Red Bull, who have had to watch as Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Mercedes fight for the race wins this season.Ferrari's 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen was third fastest, ahead of Toro Rosso's Russian Daniil Kvyat and teammate Carlos Sainz, with Max Verstappen sixth for senior team Red Bull.BUTTON BACKMichael Schumacher remains the last Ferrari driver to conquer Monaco, whose tight and twisty harbourside street circuit promises to be an even greater challenge this year with faster and wider cars.""We need to get into the rhythm and Monte Carlo is a lot about confidence at the end of the day, so you need to trust your car,"" Vettel had said on Wednesday.""I am confident that we have the tools so it's up to us to find the right set-up to get into groove and have the confidence. Wider car and wider tires - it makes the track more narrow I guess.""Under cloudy morning skies, Britain's Jenson Button returned to the cockpit as a McLaren stand-in for Fernando Alonso, who is competing at the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday.The 2009 champion was 14th fastest in the morning and 12th in the afternoon with a time only a fraction slower than Belgian teammate Stoffel Vandoorne - a solid performance for a driver who had not been in a Formula One car since last November.He also found that some things never change, complaining over the radio about the driving of others.The second session was briefly red flagged with half an hour remaining when Canadian rookie Lance Stroll, testing the limits on his first Monaco weekend, hit the barriers hard at the entrance to Casino Square (NYSE:SQ). Stroll was not injured.Britain's Jolyon Palmer also had trouble when his  Renault  (PA:RENA) suffered a blown engine.Practice in Monaco is always on a Thursday since Friday, the usual day for first running on track at other races, is a rest day.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It hurts,"" said the Red Bull driver, who finished second to Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, at the time. ""I got to the pits and everyone's running around like headless chooks (chickens).""The pole position was the only one that escaped champions Mercedes last year and Ricciardo took some solace when he then won in Malaysia after Hamilton suffered engine failure.Title rivals Hamilton and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, separated by just six points and with two wins apiece, will be the favorites in Sunday's showcase race around the metal-fenced streets.But Ricciardo reckons he can again muscle in on the action, even if his car's  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine is down on power.""Regardless of where the car is at come Monaco, I'm certainly confident going there,"" he said at the previous Spanish Grand Prix, where he finished third.""I certainly feel like I run those streets ... I already get excited thinking about Monaco, I love that place. It's cool,"" he added.""The memories of last year are still more sweet than bitter so I'm just excited to get another chance this year.""MILESTONES IN MINDBoth Hamilton and Vettel have their own milestones in mind on what promises to be a sunny week in the Mediterranean principality for the two multiple title winners.Vettel, the championship leader, is aiming to become the first Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) driver to win in Monaco since Michael Schumacher in 2001 -- almost ancient history as far as Formula One is concerned.Hamilton meanwhile can equal his late, great idol Ayrton Senna's career tally of 65 pole positions on the 30th anniversary of the Brazilian's first Monaco win.Mercedes are going for their fifth successive Monaco win, with Hamilton triumphant last year after three victories in succession for now-retired champion Nico Rosberg.The title duel, in the sixth and slowest round of the championship, will also be about absent friends and returning heroes.Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion who called it a day last year, will be filling in for Spaniard Fernando Alonso at McLaren while the double champion takes on the Indianapolis 500 on the same weekend.That challenge, made easier by McLaren's on-track Formula One woes with the team now the only ones yet to score a point this season, has already made plenty of headlines.Button's return, to a race the now-37-year-old won in 2009, will also attract plenty of interest and the team can hope for some improvements after Alonso qualified seventh in Spain.""We've made some progress in Spain, which was good,"" McLaren's executive director Zak Brown told Reuters.""I don't expect any significant improvement in Monaco other than we think we have a good race car that's suited around Monaco. So I'm hoping we score our first points of the year.""Mexican Sergio Perez, third last year for Force India ahead of Vettel, is now going for his 16th successive points finish.The wider and faster cars could also make overtaking rarer than ever at a circuit where it is notoriously difficult to pass but where accidents are commonplace.""Overtaking? Just no chance,"" French driver Romain Grosjean told Reuters.""Some places it's going to be very tight. But on the other hand, it's going to be faster and we're going to have more grip and more downforce so we'll love it.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The French leader had called to congratulate him on being re-elected in Friday’s presidential vote.""We should bring peace and stability back to the region. We hope Europe does not fall into the trap of countries that promote their wrong interpretations of the region,"" Rouhani was also quoted as saying.Paris, which is at odds with Iran over the crisis in Syria, took one of the hardest lines against Tehran during negotiations between Iran and major powers in 2015, but has been quick to restore trade ties.French carmakers PSA (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are taking advantage of their lack of U.S. operations by piling into a resurgent Iranian market that is still off-limits to rivals fearful that Trump's administration will impose sanctions.France has said it backs Trump's call to strengthen the monitoring of the deal, but that it is committed to implementing it, including the lifting of sanctions. Asked earlier on Monday whether Paris agreed with Trump's call to isolate Iran, the French foreign ministry said it would ""work toward developing political dialogue that should be part of a constructive approach with regard solving regional crises"".

PSA - the maker of Peugeots and Citroens - and Renault have pushed hard into Iran since its 2015 deal with world powers that saw international sanctions lifted in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear activities. PSA has signed production deals worth 700 million euros ($768 million), while Renault has announced a new plant investment to increase its production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year.The French companies, unlike their German, American and Japanese competitors, do not have manufacturing or sales operations in the United States. This makes them less vulnerable to penalties for any violation of U.S. sanctions still in force which ban financial transactions with Iran. The prospect of a hardened U.S. stance under President Trump - a consistent critic of the nuclear deal - has deepened the caution of carmakers with large American exposures. Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) are among those that have put Iranian ambitions on hold, industry sources told Reuters.""We're well aware of the market potential in Iran but we can't afford to take any risks,"" said a source close to VW. The company declined to comment on specific investment discussions. PSA and Renault declined to comment on their Iranian operations in detail. Earlier this year, PSA's Middle East chief Jean-Christophe Quemard acknowledged that the renewed U.S. pressure under Trump was helping his company stay ahead of foreign rivals who were holding back.""This is our opportunity to accelerate,"" Quemard said. ""We've opened up a lead and we plan to hold on to it.""Early movers to establish Iranian operations could win big in a market deprived for years of affordable state-of-the-art vehicles and where sizeable import duties hand a major advantage to locally built cars.Iranian car sales jumped 50 percent in the first quarter of 2017, according to data provider IHS Automotive, with models from  Peugeot , Renault and Iran's SAIPA showing solid gains.Tehran car salesman Mehdi Monfared, whose dealership mostly sells domestic manufacturer Iran Khodro's namesake brand, said he had witnessed an ""explosion"" in demand in recent months.""People are being less careful with their money and are spending their savings on cars,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""And the banks are lending."" PRESIDENTIAL PEUGEOTRouhani pushed the French investment to the forefront of his election campaign when he attended a ceremony this month to mark the production launch of the Peugeot 2008, the first product of post-sanctions manufacturing deals with foreign carmakers. ""When we signed the nuclear deal, critics said it was just a piece of paper that would never be implemented,"" the president, whose main challenger is a hardline cleric opposed to opening up Iranian markets, said in an Instagram post picturing him behind the wheel of the mini-SUV at the event in Tehran. ""But now we can see that auto industry sanctions have been lifted, joint venture agreements concluded and a new car is being built.""PSA and Renault have moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships with Iran Khodro and SAIPA. PSA plans to add more Peugeot and Citroen models in coming months, while Renault has introduced its Sandero compact alongside the Tondar sedan.By contrast VW, which had been considering a production tie-up with Iran's Mammut Khodro, has put the talks on the backburner because of the uncertainty, according to the source close to the group.""Any company operating in Iran or planning to enter the market needs to ask itself what could happen if there is a fundamental change of course by the U.S.,"" the person said.BMW has also studied production, import and distribution opportunities in Iran but concluded that the time was not right, according to a source familiar with the matter.""Once we see General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford set up shop our plans may be revived, but not before,"" the person said.A BMW spokesman said the company's future entry into Iran ""will depend on political and economic developments"", adding: ""There are currently no concrete plans."" Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) had announced undated plans for Iranian heavy truck production before Trump's November election victory, but now plays them down. ""There is hardly any economic growth in Iran, so demand for commercial vehicles is generally low,"" the company said.U.S. carmakers withdrew before the 1979 Iranian revolution as ties between the countries broke down. Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota (T:7203) have not signaled any Iranian investment plans since the nuclear deal. PRODUCTION REBOUNDNuclear-related sanctions were lifted after the 2015 agreement, but Washington has maintained its own pre-existing ban on financial transactions with Iran, making it harder for companies with a large U.S. presence to do business with Tehran.The Trump administration has also ordered a review of sanctions relief granted under the nuclear deal, despite acknowledging Tehran's compliance.But the U.S. pressure has not halted a steady recovery in car production in Iran, from 796,000 cars in 2013 to 1.23 million last year. IHS expects output to keep climbing to 1.34 million cars this year and 1.49 million in 2018, nearing the 1.65 million peak recorded in 2011.""Locally built vehicles are the bestsellers by some margin,"" said IHS analyst Michel Jacinto, an Iran specialist.South Korea's Hyundai (KS:005380) is building its Accent compact, to be followed by the i20 mini, as Chinese brands including Chery move to defend the small but growing footholds they gained while sanctions kept their European rivals out.Affordability may be an issue for some new models. The Peugeot 2008 is expected to be priced at around $24,000 when it arrives in showrooms - more than three times the average annual urban household income in Iran.Until such market realities are tested, however, the new products are being greeted with optimism.""The 2008 launch is the result of Rouhani's policy since the signing of the nuclear deal, so it was symbolic,"" PSA's Quemard told Reuters last week.Project lead times of two years or more mean the 2008 is the international agreement's first tangible result, Quemard said. ""So it's a good example - and it's being used as such.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nearly nine out 10 cyber insurance policies in the world are in the United States, according to Kevin Kalinich, global head of Aon Plc's cyber risk practice. The annual premium market stands at $2.5-$3 billion. The biggest reason for the larger penetration in the United States, says Bob Parisi, U.S. cyber product leader for insurance broker Marsh, ""is that the U.S. has been living with state breach notification laws for the past 10 years."" The greater transparency created an incentive for U.S. companies to get insurance to compensate for damage from incidents they were required to report. An upcoming European Union directive is expected to have the same impact there.Companies that were not prepared for WannaCry can expect to rack up business interruption costs that far exceed a ransomware payment, said Kalinich.""If you’re a hospital that turned away patients, if you're a global delivery company that can't send package, or a telecom company in Spain, Russia or China, the financial statement impact from the business interruption is much larger than the $300 ransomware,"" he said.Organizations hit by the attacks, which lock up computer systems until the victims pay a ransom, included Britain's National Health Service, French car manufacturer  Renault  (PA:RENA), and Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF).Sources close to Telefonica said the company had insurance to cover the attacks but it was too soon to estimate the economic impact.Renault and the NHS did not respond to requests for comment.West Coast cyber risk modeling firm Cyence estimated the average individual ransom cost from Friday's attacks at $300, and the total economic costs from interruption to business at $4 billion. The U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a non-profit research institute that advises governments and businesses on the costs of cyber attacks, estimated more modest total losses. They were likely to range in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and unlikely to exceed $1 billion, the group forecast. HIGH MARGIN BUSINESSA typical cyber insurance policy will protect companies against extortion like ransomware attacks, which insurers say have spiked in the past 18 months. It would cover the investigation costs and also pay the ransom, according to Parisi. But there are caveats. Companies that did not download a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) patch issued in March to protect users from vulnerabilities may be out of luck, since many cyber policies exclude coverage in such an instance.Companies using pirated software are also unlikely eligible for an insurance payout, Kalinich said.Most cyber insurance policies cover breaches of up to $50 million, with much of the losses related to the interruption of the firms' business, Parisi said. Some policies can cover losses for as much as $500-600 million.Cyber insurance policies also typically cover the cost of notifying those whose data has been breached, hiring a PR agency to address reputational damage and arranging credit monitoring for those affected, as well as potential legal suits.It is a high-margin business. Insurer Sciemus, for example, has previously said it charges around $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance and as much as seven times that to cover attacks causing physical damage. Other providers include Allianz (DE:ALVG), AIG, Chubb (NYSE:CB) and Zurich as well as Lloyds' of London insurers such as Beazley and Hiscox.DEMAND TO RISE Even before the weekend attacks, demand in Europe was expected to rise after an EU directive is implemented in mid-2018 requiring companies to notify authorities of a data breach.With strong competition and uncertainty as to how many of the losses over the weekend were insured, the impact on insurance premiums, however, may be muted.Insurers are likely to more carefully scrutinize risks they take on as well as how they word policies and exclusions, Kalinich said.""They will want to pick the companies that are most prepared,"" Kalinich said. Other firms might be eligible for coverage, but more exclusions may apply, he said.For example, insurers may seek to deny coverage if companies pay the ransom without contacting their insurers first, he said.""There are really important intricacies. You could end up losing a couple million dollars.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

840,"May 15, 2017 05:34AM ET",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,nan,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday, May 15:1. Saudi Arabia, Russia back 9-month extension to OPEC output dealSaudi Arabia and Russia, the world's two top oil producers, agreed on Monday to extend oil output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018 in a bid to erode a global crude glut.In a joint statement that followed an earlier meeting in Beijing, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak said they had agreed to prolong an existing deal by another nine months until March 2018.The timing of the announcement ahead of OPEC's next official meeting on May 25 and the statement's strong wording sparked a sharp rally in crude prices.U.S. crude jumped to a two-week high of $49.09 a barrel, up $1.26, or around 2.6%, while Brent gained $1.30 to $52.14, the highest level since May 2.2. Cyberattack spreads, though at slower paceCybersecurity experts said the spread of a ransomware worm dubbed WannaCry had slowed on Monday, but that the respite might only be brief as more people around the world return to work and turn on their computers.The cyberattack, which lock up computer systems until the victims pay a ransom, has infected more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries over the weekend.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Sunday pinned blame on the U.S. government for not disclosing more software vulnerabilities.Among the highest-profile corporate victims were, French car manufacturer  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF).3. North Korea carries out another missile testMarket participants kept a wary eye on developments in North Korea, which successfully conducted a newly developed mid-to-long range missile test on Sunday aimed at verifying the capability to carry a ""large scale heavy nuclear warhead.""The test was a significant advance in North Korea’s drive for an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the U.S. mainland.The United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss North Korea's latest missile launch, diplomats said on Sunday, which was requested by the U.S. and allies South Korea and Japan.4. China's economy loses momentum in AprilChina's growth took a step back in April after a surprisingly strong start to the year, as factory output to investment to retail sales all tapered off as authorities clamped down on debt risks in an effort to stave off a potentially damaging hit to the economy.Factory output was up 6.5% in April from a year earlier, down from 7.6% in March, and fixed-asset investment rose 8.9% in the first four months of the year, off the 9.2% in preceding four-month period.Analysts had predicted factory output would grow by 7.1% in April, and tipped fixed asset investment to rise 9.1%.Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping over the weekend pledged $124 billion in fresh financing to support its “Belt and Road” infrastructure mega-program.5. Global stocks rise to multi-year highs as investors shrug off risksGlobal stock markets rose on Monday, as investors shrugged off another missile test by North Korea and threats from a cyberattack that spread around the globe at the weekend.Most Asian indexes closed higher, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (NYSE:EPP) rising around 0.3% to its highest level since June 2015, while MSCI's emerging markets benchmark (NYSE:EEM) advanced 0.4% to a two-year high.In Europe, stocks across the continent were mostly in positive territory in mid-morning trade, with London’s FTSE 100 and Germany’s DAX scaling fresh record highs.On Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow futures inched up 44 points, or around 0.2%, the S&P 500 futures added 3 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.On the data front, Monday's calendar features a survey on manufacturing conditions in the New York region at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT). Shortly afterwards, the NAHB housebuilder sentiment survey is due at 10AM ET.Markets are pricing in around a 70% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool."
841,"May 14, 2017 10:49AM ET",Hamilton wins in Spain with Vettel second,nan,"By Alan BaldwinBARCELONA (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton won a strategic Spanish Grand Prix thriller on Sunday to cut Sebastian Vettel's overall lead in the Formula One championship to six points with a quarter of the season completed.The Mercedes driver's 55th career win was hard-fought and tense, with Ferrari's Vettel seizing the lead from Hamilton at the start and in the hunt all the way as the tire strategies played out.Hamilton took the checkered flag 3.4 seconds clear of the German, who did all he could to beat him with a thrilling move to pass the Briton's team mate Valtteri Bottas that will be replayed for some time to come.""That's how racing should be and I loved it,"" said a happy Hamilton, who raced side by side with Vettel at turn one after the German's final pitstop.""This is what the sport needs to be every single race...to have that close battle with him, a four times champion, is awesome,"" added the triple champion.Vettel now has 104 points to Hamilton's 98.The Briton, who made the move stick seven laps later and then made his tyres last to the finish, had sounded strangely breathless during the race when fretting about a strategy that turned out to be spot on. ""Lewis saved the race with an incredible drive. The strategy was great, but it was the driver who won it,"" said Mercedes F1's non-executive chairman Niki Lauda.POOR STARTThe win was Hamilton's second in Barcelona and ended a run of 10 different winners in 10 years.""I was eight seconds ahead and then...I don't know how we managed to lose that,"" said Vettel, who made the most of Hamilton's poor start. On an afternoon that saw the two multiple world champions in a battle of their own with the rest so far behind they might as well have been in another race, Daniel Ricciardo finished 75.8 seconds behind the winner.Ricciardo was the only driver not lapped by the top two in a race after inheriting third, and his first podium of the year, from Bottas after the Finn's engine expired.On a day of Finns failing to finish, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen went out at the start after a collision with Red Bull's 2016 winner Max Verstappen.Bottas, who celebrated his first career victory in Russia two weeks ago, made glancing contact with his compatriot and the impact pitched Raikkonen into Verstappen on the other side, smashing the suspension on both cars.The 19-year-old Dutch driver, with a legion of fans around the Circuit de Catalunya, shook his fist as the field disappeared in front of him and Raikkonen stopped.Stewards investigated the incident and decided to take no further action.Bottas retired 38 laps later, having started with an engine that had already done four races and was hurriedly shoe-horned into the car overnight on Friday after a water leak was discovered.Spain's double world champion Fernando Alonso, starting seventh for McLaren after a troubled practice, was forced into the gravel in a tussle with Williams's Felipe Massa and dropped to 13th. He finished 12th.The virtual safety car was deployed when Alonso's team mate Stoffel Vandoorne broke his car's suspension in a collision with Massa on lap 34.Mexican Sergio Perez finished fourth, his 15th successive points finish, for Force India with French rookie team mate Esteban Ocon fifth.Germany's Nico Hulkenberg was sixth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), with compatriot Pascal Wehrlein eighth for Sauber after a five second time penalty was applied -- the Swiss team's first points of the season -- and Carlos Sainz seventh for Toro Rosso.Russian Daniil Kvyat was eighth for Toro Rosso and French driver Romain Grosjean took the final point for Haas.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

My last lap was so-so but I could see the fans cheering and all the flags,"" said the triple champion, interviewed on the finish line in front of the crowd in a new departure for the sport.Hamilton's team mate Valtteri Bottas, a first-time winner in Russia two weeks ago, qualified third, with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth.Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, who became Formula One's youngest winner in Spain last year after Hamilton and then team mate and 2016 champion Nico Rosberg collided at the start, will line up fifth for Red Bull. Vettel's car needed an engine change between final practice and qualifying, and he praised his mechanics for their efforts in getting it all done with minutes to spare.""They did an engine change in sub two hours. It's a miracle they got me out,"" he said.ALONSO SEVENTHOn a rollercoaster afternoon, the German missed out on a second successive pole by a mere 0.051 of a second after locking up and running wide at the final chicane. ""I had it, I had it,"" he said ruefully over the radio.He could at least thank his lucky stars, or years of experience, to get that far after being told to stop the car soon after qualifying had started.The four times world champion hesitated to obey the instruction, however. ""Seems better now,"" he said and carried on. ""OK, box, Sebastian, box,"" he was told.""OK, you can push,"" came the eventual radio message from the pit wall, with the problem apparently resolved. He then set the fastest lap of the session before Hamilton and Raikkonen went quicker.Double world champion Fernando Alonso, whose McLaren broke down in first practice and was slowest overall on Friday, enjoyed a miraculous transformation -- and delighted his home crowd -- by qualifying an astonishing seventh.""Maybe it was at the oval (where) I learnt how to go quick on the straights,"" said the Spaniard, who will leave Barcelona on Sunday night for Indianapolis to compete in the Indy 500 on May 28. ""P7 is a gift and we will see what we can do tomorrow.""Sometimes the weekends start the wrong way but then they fix themselves, and vice versa. The important thing is tomorrow, to try to get a few points,"" he added.""It was better than expected but the support from the people gives you a few extra tenths.""Australian Daniel Ricciardo was sixth for Red Bull, with Mexican Sergio Perez eighth in a Force India.Britain's Jolyon Palmer, yet to score a point this season, had another disappointing Saturday after qualifying 17th in the  Renault  (PA:RENA) while team mate Nico Hulkenberg went through to the second phase and will start 13th.""Yesterday felt good, today I've just struggled,"" said Palmer, whose results have left him feeling the pressure. ""It's tough. I really thought this weekend could be good but today it's all come crashing down.""Canadian 18-year-old rookie Lance Stroll, also yet to finish in the points after four races, failed to get his Williams through the first phase and will line up 18th. Brazilian team mate Felipe Massa will start ninth.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

851,"Apr 30, 2017 01:17PM ET",Bottas wins in Russia for his first F1 victory,nan,"By Alan BaldwinSOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Finland's Valtteri Bottas celebrated the first Formula One victory of his career at the Russian Grand Prix on Sunday after jumping both Ferraris at the start and then holding his nerve over the tense closing laps.Championship leader Sebastian Vettel, who had started on pole position alongside Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) team mate Kimi Raikkonen, extended his advantage to 13 points with second place after putting Bottas under huge pressure at the finish.The German crossed the line just 0.6 seconds behind a man who joined Mercedes from Williams in January as replacement for retired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg and was finally a winner after 81 starts. ""Took quite a while, huh?,"" said the Finn over the radio as he took the chequered flag, an expletive bleeped out for the listening world as he whooped in a rare outburst of emotion. ""Worth the wait.""""This strange opportunity came over the winter to join this team and I have to thank the team for making this possible,"" he added after meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin before spraying champagne on the podium.""First win and hopefully first of many... it's a good feeling.""It was the first time in four years, since Raikkonen won with Lotus in Australia in 2013, that a Finnish driver had stood on the top step.Raikkonen made it two Finns in the top three with Britain's Lewis Hamilton, Vettel's closest rival, struggling to match the leaders' pace and finishing fourth for Mercedes.Vettel now has 86 points after the opening four races with triple champion Hamilton, a winner in China, second on 73 and Bottas third with 63.Mercedes continued their record of winning every Russian Grand Prix since the first in 2014, this time against the odds after Ferrari had swept the front row for the first time in nine years.But their proud boast of also leading every lap around the Olympic Park circuit disappeared when Vettel briefly led following Bottas's first pitstop.After an aborted start, with Fernando Alonso's McLaren breaking down on the formation lap, Bottas seized the lead from third on the grid.The safety car was then deployed after a collision between Renault's Jolyon Palmer and Haas's Romain Grosjean put both out, and the race settled down into a procession before the nail-biting finale.""I tried everything to catch Valtteri. I thought there would be an opportunity on the back straight,"" said Vettel, winner of two of the first three races for his resurgent Italian team.""I thought there was an opportunity but I was not sure what Felipe Massa would do and ended up losing out,"" he added, with the Williams driver delaying him at a key point in the chase. ""It doesn't matter, though. Big congratulations to Valtteri. It is his day.""Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen finished fifth with Sergio Perez chalking up his 14th successive points finish for Force India and French team mate Esteban Ocon seventh.Nico Hulkenberg was eighth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), with Massa ninth for Williams and Spaniard Carlos Sainz taking the final point for Toro Rosso.Canadian rookie Lance Stroll finally reached the finish line after three retirements in a row and took 11th place for Williams.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

852,"Apr 30, 2017 09:18AM ET","Wary of Trump, EU courts Iran to boost moderates before polls",nan,"By Alissa de CarbonnelTEHRAN (Reuters) - Wary of U.S. President Donald Trump's tough talk on Iran, the European Union is courting Tehran to show Iranians preparing to vote in a May 19 presidential poll that it is committed to a nuclear deal and they stand to benefit, EU diplomats say.    Europe's energy commissioner is leading more than 50 European firms in a business forum in Tehran over the weekend - the latest bid to foster new ties in the 16 months since Iran curbed its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.    Of the six major powers who engineered the deal - the United States, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - EU nations bore the brunt of the oil embargo on Iran and stand to gain the most from a thaw they view as a victory for European diplomacy.Meeting with Iran's atomic chief Ali Akbar Salehi, Commissioner Miguel Arias-Canete echoed the EU's mantra that it is ""fully committed"" to the 2015 deal and expects the same from all other parties.But the bloc's leverage remains limited - particularly if it is not able to shield European firms from the risk of remaining U.S. sanctions and encourage big banks to reverse over a decade of Iran's exclusion from the international financial system.    The latter was a theme of another big conference in Tehran on Saturday attended by Germany and Iran's central banks.Some Western companies have returned - planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) and carmakers Peugeot–Citroen and  Renault  (PA:RENA) - but many more have hung back, fearing Trump will tighten the screws on an already complex set of rules for engaging with Iran.    The pace and scale of Western investment is at the heart of a challenge by hardline rivals of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, who is seeking re-election in May.    Iran's ultimate authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his loyalists have criticized Rouhani's policy of rapprochement with the West, arguing the 2015 nuclear accord had not yielded the benefits he promised.""He needs more time... He has to be given a chance,"" Iran's vice president, Masoumeh Ebtekar, told Reuters in an interview.""There is a lot of enthusiasm about working with Iran now and ... I hope that the American administration wakes up to these realities,"" she added.The Trump administration said on April 18 it was launching an inter-agency review of whether the lifting of sanctions against Iran was in the United States' national security interests, while acknowledging that Tehran was complying with the deal to rein in its nuclear program.CONFRONTATION RISKEU diplomats voiced concern that a more confrontational stance by the Trump administration could empower Iran's hardliners ahead of the elections - although there is no sign the United States intends to walk away from the deal.EU diplomats say they share U.S. concerns over Iran's human rights record, its ballistic missiles tests, its funding of blacklisted militant groups and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.    ""We disagree that we have to address these issues by ditching the (nuclear) deal,"" one EU diplomat told Reuters. ""This will only empower those (in Iran) with a more confrontational stance - bring out the worst in the system.""    For now, Iranian leaders have kept their cool, with Salehi saying Iran will only take ""reciprocal action"" if the U.S. is found in breach of the deal - leaving EU diplomats caught in a balancing act between the two long-time rivals.    In recent months, European leaders have been frequent visitors to Tehran with businessmen in tow - in an effort to keep alive the 2015 accord, which also has the support of Russia and China, rivals for influence in the Islamic Republic.    The bloc's trade with Iran has partially recovered - much of that due to oil exports from Iran in what one EU official called ""a direct incentive to stick to the deal"".    The International Monetary Fund this year applauded Iran's ""impressive recovery"", with growth expected over 6 percent for the last 12 months and low inflation - a record that Rouhani has been keen to defend.    But the hoped-for a boom since the EU and United Nations sanctions over Iran's nuclear program were lifted a year ago has been hampered by separate U.S. measures in place over Iran's missile program.    ""The Europeans want to at least create the optical impression they are politically invested in this deal working,"" said Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Even if from a commercial perspective, companies are essentially on hold.""     The risk of falling afoul of U.S. measures has been enough to persuade major Western banks to stay away from Iran, and Tehran accuses Washington of undermining the nuclear deal by scaring investors away from Iran.    While acknowledging domestic criticism, Salehi told reporters Tehran will remain committed to the deal regardless of the outcome of next month's vote.       There are also signs that the EU's firm stance has given U.S. officials pause, with senators saying they delayed a bill to slap new sanctions on Iran due to worries over how the bloc would react and the Iranian presidential elections.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

No details about the cost or duration were given, although it is likely to be until 2020 at least.Honda currently has an exclusive agreement with former world champions McLaren but that relationship, which started in 2015, has been strained due to a lack of engine performance and reliability.Sauber, a long-standing mid-table team who are languishing near the back of the field after fighting back from a period of financial difficulties, are using last season's Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) engines at present.Neither they, nor McLaren, have scored a point so far in three races this year.""In addition to the partnership with McLaren which began in 2015, Honda will begin supplying power units to Sauber as a customer team starting from next year,"" said Katsuhide Moriyama, Honda's head of brand and communication operations.""This will be a new challenge in Honda’s F1 activities,"" added the executive in a statement.""In order to leverage the benefits of supplying to two teams to the maximum extent, we will strengthen the systems and capabilities of both of our two development operations, namely HRD Sakura and the operation in Milton Keynes.""Under Formula One rules designed to ensure no team is left without an engine supply, manufacturers are obliged to supply a team if they have spare capacity and are asked to.Champions Mercedes currently supply three of the 10 teams, as do  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Ferrari, while Honda have only one partner.The Japanese manufacturer is still hoping to make big strides in the latter part of the season, with Mercedes and Ferrari enjoying a big power advantage over the others.Sauber principal Monisha Kaltenborn said the deal was part of the team's realignment and recovery as it celebrates its 25th anniversary in Formula One.""We have set another milestone with this new engine era, which we await with huge excitement and of course we are looking for new opportunities,"" she said in a statement.""We very much look forward to our partnership with Honda, which sets the course for a successful future -- from a strategic as well as from a technological perspective.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""The first run was not really tidy, so I left it to the end, and I improved some time in the last sector,"" said Vettel, who had to wait before confirmation came over the radio that Mercedes were beaten.""I immediately opened the radio 'tell me about the others, tell me about the others!',"" he said. ""When I got the message we got it I was over the moon. The car was phenomenal this afternoon.""Bottas was fastest in the first two phases of qualifying, with the choice of tires coming into play, and those who had suspected the champions were hiding their pace in practice appeared to be justified.But that too was a false dawn, with glum looks and shaking heads in the Mercedes garage as the reality of the situation emerged.""I just wasn't quick enough today, it was all in the last sector... so there's some work to do,"" said Hamilton, who had racked up six poles in a row before Bottas took his career first in Bahrain two weeks ago.""Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) are quickest in qualifying and generally in race trim, so it will be interesting to see where we stand tomorrow,"" added the Briton.Bottas, who has yet to win a grand prix and joined from Williams in January, recognized Mercedes had expected far more from a circuit where they have led every lap since the race first appeared on the calendar in 2014.""For sure they have a very good car and we are struggling to compete with them,"" he said of Ferrari.""Personally, and as a team, coming into this weekend probably we were thinking that it's going to be better than Bahrain. So far it's turned out to be not so good and Ferrari seems to be doing something better here than us.""So for sure it's disappointing for us not to be on pole,"" added the Finn.Australian Daniel Ricciardo qualified fifth with Massa sixth and between the two Red Bulls with Max Verstappen behind in seventh. Renault  (PA:RENA), who have struggled to score points, again had a car in the top 10 on the grid with Germany's Nico Hulkenberg qualifying eighth.

Really, those guys are just very quick,"" he said.""The Ferrari seemed very, very fast on the long runs, so we need to work out how we can improve our pace.""Raikkonen and Bottas also have good records in Sochi, however, with the 2007 world champion finishing third last year and his fellow Finn taking the first fastest lap of his Formula One career in 2014 when he also came third for Williams.""We were learning about the tires on long runs and short runs and it seems like over one lap we still have work to do to get the maximum out of the UltraSoft tire -- that's our focus tonight,"" said Bottas.Raikkonen said Ferrari were catching up but just how much remained to be seen.""Are we at the same level as them (Mercedes)? I don’t know. It's not far off, let's put it that way,"" he had said on Thursday.The morning session was halted briefly when the engine cover blew off Esteban Ocon's Force India, leaving debris for marshals to recover.Russian reserve Sergey Sirotkin replaced Germany's Nico Hulkenberg at  Renault  (PA:RENA) for the opening session but the car broke down on track before he could do a timed lap and was pushed off by marshals.Red Bull's Max Verstappen had problems in the afternoon, pulling over and complaining of a lack of power, while McLaren again struggled with Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne already resigned to starting the race at the back after an engine change.

I'm not for it,"" Haas F1 driver Magnussen told reporters ahead of Sunday's Russian Grand Prix.""I don't think we need something like that.

863,"Apr 16, 2017 03:43PM ET",Vettel wins Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Hamilton,nan,"By Alan BaldwinMANAMA (Reuters) - Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel forged seven points clear at the top of the Formula One standings on Sunday after winning a Bahrain Grand Prix thriller that saw Lewis Hamilton penalized for underhand tactics.Hamilton, who had started the floodlit race level on points with the German, took second place for Mercedes after staging a late chase following the five-second penalty for driving deliberately slowly into the pits.Hamilton's Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas was third after leading from his first pole position, struggling with his tires and twice respecting team orders to allow the faster Briton through.The victory was Vettel's second of the season after the four-times world champion won the opener in Australia. Hamilton, who won in China last weekend, crossed the finish line 6.6 seconds behind.Vettel's 44th win lifted him to 68 points, with Hamilton second on 61 and the championship looking ever more likely to be an evenly matched battle between the two with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Mercedes a cut above the rest.""Yes guys, that's what I'm talking about,"" whooped the German, who was helped by a safety car after an aggressive early pitstop.""It was a really great day. It was on the last half of the out lap when all the fireworks were going off that I was like 'I love what I do',"" he said. Hamilton's race, already compromised by Vettel passing him off the start for second place, unraveled further when he drove ""unnecessarily slowly"" as he came in for his first pit stop.The move was a deliberate one to prevent Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo getting the jump with a quick stop while Hamilton waited behind Bottas, already in the pits.The Briton served the penalty at his second stop, frustration evident from his shaking helmet, before charging back and taking more than a second a lap out of Vettel's advantage.The task of making up 20 seconds in 16 laps was ultimately too great a task.BACK FOOT""The pitlane was my fault and apologies to the team. I tried my hardest to catch up,"" said Hamilton, who thanked Bottas for his help.Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said the Finn's hopes of a first win had been hit even before the start when a problem with a generator on the grid left him with the wrong tire pressures.""From then on we were on the back foot,"" he said.Bottas kept the lead for the opening laps, with Vettel close behind in a five-car train.The safety car appeared on track after 18-year-old Canadian newcomer Lance Stroll, suffering his third retirement in three races, turned into Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz as the Spaniard left the pits.""I got hit from the side,"" the Williams rookie exclaimed.Red Bull's Max Verstappen had already crashed out by then, blaming brake failure after he trekked across the gravel into the tire barrier on lap 12.""It was a great team effort today and I felt like we are quick. I tried to put Valtteri under pressure. But the early pit stop worked,"" said Vettel.""Lewis obviously was a very big threat again towards the end... but the car was a dream today.""Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth with Australian Ricciardo fifth for Red Bull and Brazilian Felipe Massa sixth for Williams on the 75th birthday of team founder Frank Williams.Mexican Sergio Perez finished seventh for Force India, his 13th successive points finish, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean eighth for U.S.-owned Haas. Germany's Nico Hulkenberg was ninth for  Renault  (PA:RENA), that team's first points of the year, and French rookie Esteban Ocon bagged the final point for Force India.McLaren's nightmare continued with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne failing to start and Fernando Alonso retiring on the final laps but classified 14th.""I never raced with less power in my life,"" the Spaniard told his team.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

864,"Apr 15, 2017 02:21PM ET",Bottas ends Hamilton's pole run in Bahrain,nan,"By Alan BaldwinMANAMA (Reuters) - Finland's Valtteri Bottas took his first Formula One pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday with a sizzling lap that ended Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton's bid for a seventh in a row.Triple world champion Hamilton qualified alongside, a mere 0.023 - or 17 centimeters - slower than Bottas's time of one minute 28.769 seconds but with everything still to play for on Sunday.That clinched the first front row lockout of the season for the reigning champions after two races with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel splitting the Silver Arrows.Hamilton, joking and laughing in a later news conference, appeared delighted for Bottas and offered a warm handshake to a man who left China last weekend with his mind in turmoil after a costly mistake behind the safety car.""Firstly, a big congratulations to Valtteri. He has been working so hard, gelled so well with the team and today he was just quicker, he did the better job and hats off to him,"" said Hamilton.""That's how close I think qualifying should always be. It forces us all to be more on the limit.""""For sure, it feels good,"" said Bottas, the first Finnish driver to secure a pole position since Hamilton's then-team mate Heikki Kovalainen for McLaren at the 2008 British Grand Prix, 168 races ago.""It's my first pole in my career in my fifth season in F1 so it took a few years but hopefully it's the first of many for me,"" he added.Vettel, joint leader of the world championship standings with Hamilton after two races with one win each, will start in third place with Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo fourth.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, whose last pole was also in 2008, qualified fifth. Mercedes won the race last year with now-retired champion Nico Rosberg, the man Bottas has replaced, and have now taken five successive poles at the desert Sakhir circuit.Hamilton had been fastest in both the first and second phases of qualifying, and set the pace with his first lap in the final session before Bottas pulled off his masterstroke.The unflappable Finn let out a rare whoop over the team radio, with engineer Tony Ross -- who had inadvertently called Bottas 'Nico' during the race in China -- replying that ""for a moment there you actually showed some emotion, well done"".Hamilton and Vettel, sitting alongside Bottas in front of reporters, jokingly asked the polesitter whether the Finnish language had a word for 'excited' or 'exciting'.Bottas thought hard but words failed him. ""Kind of,"" he hesitated, as his rivals laughed.""See, it doesn't exist,"" said Vettel. ""It's not one that's really used much in the vocabulary,"" added Hamilton.""I don't know really,"" concluded Bottas.Dutch teenager Max Verstappen qualified sixth for Red Bull with Nico Hulkenberg seventh on a good day for  Renault  (PA:RENA), who had Britain's Jolyon Palmer in 10th place after his first appearance in the final phase.Brazilian Felipe Massa starts eighth for Williams and France's Romain Grosjean ninth for Haas. German driver Pascal Wehrlein also made a strong return after a back injury kept him out of the first two races, qualifying 13th for Sauber while Swedish team mate Marcus Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) was only 19th.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

(on a) long run we might be quite a bit behind, but I am sure we can improve for tomorrow,"" said Vettel.Hamilton ran off the track after being baulked by Nico Hulkenberg's  Renault  (PA:RENA).""These drivers are just so dangerous,"" the Briton said over the team radio, with both drivers later summoned to see the stewards. Ricciardo was third in the evening with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth after his afternoon session went up in smoke, with the Finn abandoning his smoking car and trudging off in the desert heat.The solitary walk through the arid landscape in overalls and helmet, before being collected by a scooter, was an arresting sight -- and also typical of a driver with 'Iceman' tattooed on his left arm.""Walking through the desert in 37C heat. In full race suit. Helmet on. Only the Iceman is cool enough to do it,"" the official formula1.com website observed on its Twitter feed.ENGINE CHANGEWhile Raikkonen built up a sweat, Vettel settled in at the top of the timesheets with a best lap of one minute 32.697 seconds. He did 1:31.310 in the cooler evening conditions, with Raikkonen fourth after an engine change. Champions Mercedes had been more focused on longer runs with heavier fuel loads in the searing afternoon heat, with Bottas only 14th.They speeded up in the evening and did more laps than anyone.""It's definitely tougher than before, driving in the heat with these new cars. But I'm used to being in a Finnish sauna, so it's no problem,"" commented Bottas.The 'T-wing', fixed on the engine cover of the Finn's car, broke free during the second session and was collected by Verstappen's Red Bull, damaging the car's floor.""It did about 50,000 pounds ($62,650) of damage so I think they should be banned on grounds of safety and cost,"" said Red Bull principal Christian Horner.Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda spent much of the opening session chatting to the sport's former commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone, who was appearing at a race for the first time since he was shuffled aside by chairman Chase Carey and Formula One's new owners Liberty Media (NASDAQ:FWONA). Red Bull's Max Verstappen was third and eighth fastest.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, who missed the first two races with a back injury, returned with Sauber and was 18th and 19th in the two sessions.McLaren's Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne, who scored a point in Bahrain last year as a stand-in, had a troubled day and stopped on track with engine problems 21 minutes from the end of the first session.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

866,"Apr 12, 2017 11:00AM ET","In her flagship town, France's Le Pen is already a winner",nan,"By Matthias Blamont and Lucien LibertHENIN-BEAUMONT, France (Reuters) - In Henin-Beaumont, where French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen's National Front won power three years ago, her backers are sure she will win a thumping victory later this month - locally, at least.This former coalmining community in northern France, a town where unemployment approaches 20 percent, is one of only about a dozen municipalities - out of 36,000 nationwide - that are controlled by her far-right party and its affiliates.The anti-immigrant, anti-European Union Le Pen, who grew up near Paris, has since made a home here and will cast her own ballot in the first voting round at its town hall on April 23.""I believe Marine Le Pen will easily score 60 to 65 percent here,"" Jean-Robert Havet, a technician for carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), said of the first round.Opinion polls say she is tied for first place nationally in that round with centrist Emmanuel Macron, both around 24 per cent. But Macron is widely seen winning the runoff on May 7.Residents of Henin-Beaumont told Reuters they were mostly satisfied with the way the party runs the town under Mayor Steeve Briois, 44, and forecast a strong turnout to back his boss at the first round of voting.The FN's 2014 municipal election victory in this community of 27,000 brought an end to seven decades of left-wing rule.Its rise to power epitomizes the way voters have dumped the left for its failure to address joblessness, and backed the far-right's anti-immigrant and anti-globalization stand.On top of that, voters were fed up with the former Socialist mayor after he was convicted of misusing public funds. Unusually, Briois did not even need to campaign until the normal runoff vote since he won an absolute majority - precisely 50.25 percent - in the first round.""Steeve renovates schools, roads, buildings ... You couldn't see any of this before. It was a corrupted, dead town here,"" said Havet, 59. Although Le Pen's program resonates strongly in Henin-Beaumont and towns like it, she does less well nationally because many voters see her position on immigration as extreme. Her anti-globalization line also faces competition from the unexpectedly strong Jean-Luc Melenchon, a veteran far-left candidate who is just as spirited a debater as she is.In this town, though, there was little hesitation and even less uncertainty. ""She is close to the people. She has compassion for blue collar workers unlike those 'champagne socialists' you see on television,"" Havet said.Many others at the town's busy weekly market echoed that. ""I will vote 'FN' in the next election. We have a good mayor,"" said Celine Brulin, 46, who is unemployed. Even critics of the Front like Alain Alpern, 70, who once sat on the town council himself, predict a high Le Pen score. ""She will easily get to 50 percent and I even fear she will secure much higher figures. Le Pen has an address here so local residents are proud,"" he said. ""The mayor is everywhere and the National Front has a very good communication strategy.""Not all residents were pleased with the local administration and Le Pen's ideas.""If Marine Le Pen won, I wonder if I should leave France for good despite the fact I grew up here and I'm French,"" said Fatima Amara, a social worker of Algerian descent. ""I won't be arrested for what I'm telling you, will I?""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Briton is now five behind Schumacher's overall record of 68 poles.It was also the 58th time in 61 races that a Mercedes will start at the front.The German outfit were hotly pursued by Ferrari though.Vettel set a scorching pace to top the final practice session earlier on Saturday. The German and team mate Kimi Raikkonen, who was fourth, also topped the timesheets at the end of the first two parts of qualifying.Ferrari appeared to be on course to seize pole, with even Mercedes boss Niki Lauda betting against his own team. But in the end Vettel missed out.""Maybe I 'chickened' on to the brakes a bit too soon,"" said the 29-year-old Vettel.""Obviously it was very close with Valtteri, good job we got just enough margin to make it to the front row.” Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo set the fifth-fastest time ahead of Williams driver Felipe Massa.Nico Hulkenberg went seventh-quickest for  Renault  (PA:RENA) ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez.Russian Daniil Kvyat in the Toro Rosso was ninth with 18-year-old Williams rookie Lance Stroll rounding out the top 10.Fernando Alonso, who impressively hustled his McLaren Honda into the second part of qualifying, will start 13th.Sauber's Antonio Giovinazzi, who got impressively up to speed on his debut in Australia as a stand-in for Pascal Wehrlein, caused the biggest drama of the day when he ricocheted off the barrier lining the start-finish straight after losing control of his car in the final corner.Max Verstappen, nursing an engine problem with his Red Bull, was unable to progress past the first part of qualifying after being forced to abort his lap. He ended up 19th on the timesheets.Sunday's race will see Vettel going all out to cement Ferrari's credentials as genuine title contenders with a second successive win, after his triumph in the season-opening race in Australia.Hamilton, however, is the most successful driver at the Shanghai circuit with four victories to his name.However, with rain forecast for Sunday, teams could be heading into the unknown, especially after the weather all but wiped out the first two practice sessions on Friday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

871,"Mar 24, 2017 09:51AM ET",EIB asks French diesel inquiry to probe Renault's use of loans,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The European Investment Bank has asked French investigators to find out whether 800 million euros ($863 million) of EU-backed loans to  Renault  (PA:RENA) could have been used to develop test-cheating diesel engines, according to documents seen by Reuters.The European Union lending arm wrote to judges leading a fraud investigation into preliminary findings that Renault diesel engines - like Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) - had been configured to manipulate nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions tests.Renault, which has consistently denied breaking any laws or emissions rules, had no immediate comment on Friday. The Paris prosecutor's office did not respond to requests for comment.Since 2009, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has granted more than 8 billion euros in preferential loans to back development of vehicles with lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by carmakers including VW, exposed in 2015 for using software ""defeat devices"" to dupe U.S. regulatory tests.Technologies funded by the EIB have included diesel engines, because they emit less CO2 than gasoline equivalents. More recently, however, diesels have been shown to produce many times the legal limit of toxic NOx in real driving.""The EIB has granted Renault several loans to finance projects including research and development to reduce vehicle CO2 emissions (amounting to more than 800 million euros),"" the bank's chief fraud investigator told the French judges.The Jan. 30 letter also proposes a follow-up meeting ""in order to establish whether our financing is implicated in your investigations and to offer you all possible assistance.""It adds: ""The EIB enforces a zero-tolerance policy towards fraud and corruption and strives to ensure that no illegal activity tarnishes its business.""A spokeswoman for the Luxembourg-based bank declined to comment on the contact with French prosecutors. Two 400 million-euro loans granted to Renault in 2009 and 2013 have since been reimbursed, she said, and a third outstanding 180 million-euro facility did not cover any diesel development.MARKET FALLOUTRenault shares fell 7.8 percent in three days to end last week at 78.65 euros after excerpts of a November report by France's DGCCRF consumer fraud watchdog appeared in newspapers, wiping 2 billion euros off the company's value. The stock has since recovered some ground to 80.68 euros, as of 1235 GMT.Based on the agency's findings, prosecutors opened an investigation in January into fraud allegations against Renault and its Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn. If found guilty, the group could be fined up to 10 percent of annual revenue, or 3.58 billion euros.The DGCCRF report, also seen by Reuters, cites engine software parameters from Renault's own technical documentation that partially or entirely deactivate anti-pollution functions such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and ""lean NOx traps"" (LNT) outside predictable regulatory test conditions.""The use of software in the (engine) calculator to limit the effectiveness of anti-pollution devices mainly or exclusively to vehicle approval tests is a strategy that Renault has implemented,"" the DGCCRF concluded.Renault has argued in press briefings that the limits on emissions control were necessary to protect its engines while maintaining driving performance and fuel efficiency, and therefore allowed under current EU rules.The carmaker has nonetheless recalled almost 11,500 cars to tweak engine calibrations and reduce NOx emissions - a handful of the 900,000 sold in France with the controversial software.Changes will include extending the narrow range of air intake temperatures within which the EGR is programmed to work. In France's climate, the calibration renders the anti-pollution device virtually useless for seven months of the year, Renault itself concedes in company documents also seen by Reuters.The EIB, the world's biggest multilateral lender with almost 80 billion euros granted each year, has faced scrutiny over its funding to carmakers in light of the ""dieselgate"" scandal and subsequent investigations in France and other countries.VW, which has set aside 22.6 billion euros to cover its U.S. criminal settlement and other costs, was awarded 400 million euros by the bank in 2009 to develop ""green technologies"".The German carmaker's use of EIB funds has been ""very thoroughly"" investigated, bank President Werner Hoyer was quoted as saying at a January news conference.

He slammed into a barrier, scattering debris on the track and the red flag was raised until his wrecked car was hauled off.Felipe Massa's Williams car stopped half an hour into the second session.Twice champion Fernando Alonso was 12th fastest in FP2 and may have been buoyed by the result after arriving in Melbourne anxious after a dreary winter testing for the Woking-based team.With fatter tires and improved aerodynamics, the speed of the new cars was impressive. Hamilton's fastest lap was just shy of Vettel's pole record of 1:23.529 set at Albert Park in 2011.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I can confirm that a judicial investigation has been opened into aggravated cheating,"" the source said.The source said the Paris prosecutor had opened the investigation on March 15, after the finance ministry's DGCCRF consumer affairs and anti-fraud body had referred the case to the courts.A Fiat spokesman said the company took note of the investigation and reiterated that its diesel vehicles fully comply with emission regulations, as confirmed by the Italian Transport Ministry.The spokesman said the company would continue to collaborate with the authorities on all investigations and was confident the matter would be fully resolved. Following Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission in 2015 of cheating on U.S. diesel emission tests, several European countries launched their own tests on vehicle emissions.They found on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits - for some GM,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler models - and widespread use of devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions.The French test program has so far led to four carmakers -Volkswagen, Renault, Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group - being referred for possible prosecution by the consumer fraud agency.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Yeah. I didn’t make a big dent into it,"" the  Renault  (PA:RENA) driver said of his 2016 tally from 21 grands prix""I’m really confident that it will be a much better season. I haven’t got a lot of doubt about it.""Last season was a hard slog in a car best forgotten.Announced by Lotus as a driver before Renault completed their takeover of a team in desperate need of finance, Palmer was in danger of being squeezed out after the French manufacturer signed Nico Hulkenberg for 2017.Instead, it was Denmark's Kevin Magnussen who left for Haas and Palmer the one who stayed. Which was just as well, because he had no Plan B.""I feel like it’s completely different sat here now,"" he told Reuters in an interview during winter testing. ""I honestly think you learn more in the difficult times. And really, last year there were times where I had to pull myself together.""The year started quite difficult and I had to regroup and get my head straight for doing what I could the rest of the year.

I’ve come through that and now hopefully we are going to have a much stronger year, and I know I can dig deep and when the pressure’s on, shine through.""Renault are aiming for fifth place overall, a big improvement from ninth last year, but Palmer will still be occupying a very different space from Hamilton.BLING-FREE ZONEThere are no gold necklaces, Hollywood red carpets or private jets in the life of one of the few F1 drivers with a university education. Mention the word ""bling"" and he smiles.""You know what, I think that’s a long way away,"" said Palmer, who shares an apartment in London with his sister when not living out of a suitcase.""If that happens, then someone needs to give me a bit of a shove back into reality.""""I can’t see myself living in Monaco, but maybe in one year’s time I’ll suddenly have a change of heart and Nico convinces me it’s really good and I move there.""Somehow, you suspect not.A champion in the GP2 feeder series at the fourth attempt in 2014 -- Hamilton won it first time out in 2006 -- Palmer acquired a reputation for steady improvement that was also evident last year.He will need to shift up a gear against Le Mans winner Hulkenberg, who brings a wealth of experience from Williams and Force India and will be expected to lead the team, but Palmer said he felt a lot more relaxed.""I know what to expect, I know how it works and I’ve got a good relationship with the management here,"" he said.""I feel like hopefully we’re set up for the future as a team now.""Last year was Renault’s first year back, no-one knew really what to expect, the pressure was big on both drivers.

The agency announced at the time it had found ""suspected breaches"" of French law by Renault, and prosecutors opened a formal investigation two months later.Renault shares fell 3.7 percent on Wednesday after more details of the watchdog's allegations were published by daily Liberation.The carmaker has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any offence. It was not immediately available to comment on Wednesday and Ghosn could not be reached for comment. The finance ministry declined to comment. Following Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) exposure in 2015 for U.S. diesel test-cheating, several European countries launched their own investigative test programs.They found on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits - for some GM, Renault and Fiat Chrysler models - and widespread use of devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions.The French test program, overseen by an investigating committee, has so far led to action against Renault and three others: PSA Group, Fiat Chrysler and VW.In its Renault submission, the DGCCRF emphasized Ghosn's managerial responsibility, the judicial source said, confirming other French media reports on Wednesday.While Renault's ""entire chain of command"" was responsible, the dossier said, the chief executive was directly accountable because ""no delegation of powers had been established by Carlos Ghosn regarding the approval of engine control strategies"".Carmakers including Renault have broadly invoked an EU legal loophole designed to allow so-called ""defeat devices"" only when they are necessary for safety or engine protection. Renault and several of its peers told the French hearings that devices in their vehicles were legal under the EU exemption. But the panel concluded that the technical justifications ""remained to be proven"".Renault had explained the NOx-cutting exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology in its top-selling diesel engines had been found to cause serious turbo clogging problems.Engineers responded by programming the EGR to shut down outside a narrow range of air intake temperatures, 17-35 degrees Celsius (63-95 degrees Fahrenheit). While passing regulatory tests carried out near room temperature over short periods, the protocol sends NOx emissions sky-high on the road.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Previously they were more preoccupied with losing weight in a sport where the lightest men have enjoyed an advantage.Sainz, whose father and namesake was a world rally champion, was vocal last year about the dangers of shedding too much but he told Reuters during testing in Barcelona that the situation was now much healthier.""This year I have had diets but diets to be fit, not diets to be as slim and as skinny as possible...and because of that, I am a much happier person,"" said the 21-year-old.""At the end of 2016 my mum could tell me, every time I was coming home: ‘You look like you are not yourself, you look very skinny, you can see your bones here.’ It’s not normal.""She’s extremely happy and she now sees a smile on my face when I eat her food, while before I was sitting there sad with a piece of chicken and I was completely annoyed about it.""A year ago, Sainz and other drivers such as Red Bull's Australian Daniel Ricciardo were being pushed to shed kilos to gain performance.Formula One cars have a minimum weight limit, minus fuel but with driver included, and designers aim to get it down as far as possible so that additional ballast can be distributed around the car to improve handling.In 2014, the first year of the V6 turbo hybrid era, the limit did not compensate sufficiently for the heavier engines and drivers had to lose weight - in some cases an unhealthy amount.Now, it is important to be strong enough to get to the finish.""I think this year they will be proper gladiators out there, you know,"" commented Mercedes's reigning but retired champion Nico Rosberg.""The cars will take them to their physical limits and we might even see drivers losing race wins because of just being 'game over' physically.""Pit crews have also been busy in the gym to practise manhandling the heavier and larger Pirelli tyres.If there are any complaints, they come from drivers like Force India's lanky Frenchman Esteban Ocon who has had to eat more than he would wish.""I had to eat so much food,"" the 20-year-old said of winter training that has seen him add five kg.

The announcement is part of Mitsubishi Motor's efforts to rebuild its management system after it admitted last year that it had overstated the mileage on a number of its cars sold in Japan, battering domestic sales and tarnishing its brand image.From April, corporate vice president positions for roles including product development and marketing and sales would be occupied by officials from Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors said.This would hike the number of Nissan executives on Mitsubishi Motors' management team to seven, from two now. ""We need to strengthen our corporate governance to avoid a repeat of last year's scandal, along with scandals previous to that,"" Mitsubishi Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Osamu Masuko told reporters during a teleconference.After taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan installed Carlos Ghosn - its CEO at the time - as chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, while also naming two Nissan officials to Mitsubishi's board of directors.Nissan also dispatched other executives to the smaller automaker, including Trevor Mann, previously Nissan's chief performance officer who became chief operating officer at Mitsubishi late last year.Last month, Ghosn said he would step down from the top position at Nissan to focus on deepening the company's alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors.Separately, Nissan said Shiro Nakamura, the company's chief creative officer and one of Japan's best-known car designers, will retire after nearly 20 years at the automaker.Nakamura, 66, is recognized for referencing science fiction anime and embracing Japan's culture of ""cute"" in models including the GT-R supercar, the Cube compact MPV and the Juke SUV crossover, setting the automaker apart from many of its rivals which have been accused of making lookalike cars.Nakamura joined Nissan in 1999 from Japanese truckmaker Isuzu Motors (T:7202) and was one of the first key hires by Ghosn shortly after Ghosn himself arrived from French automaker Renault to save the company from bankruptcy.Alfonso Albaisa, who currently overseas design at Nissan's premium Infiniti brand, will succeed Nakamura, while former BMW (DE:BMWG) global chief designer Karim Habib will become the brand's new chief designer, effective July 1.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

884,"Mar 10, 2017 01:30PM ET",Mitsubishi likely to share pickups with Nissan: COO,nan,"By Laurence FrostGENEVA (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) and its new parent Nissan (T:7201) are studying joint production of pickup trucks in Southeast Asia as they look for savings within the broader Renault-Nissan alliance, a senior executive told Reuters.The Japanese groups may pool technical underpinnings and production of future replacements for the Thai-built Nissan Navara and Mitsubishi Triton, Mitsubishi Chief Operating Officer Trevor Mann said in an interview at the Geneva car show.Mitsubishi's pickup architectures are likely to become the basis for future alliance models, said Mann, who was despatched by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn to help turn Mitsubishi around after Nissan paid $2.3 billion for a 34 percent controlling stake in the scandal-hit company last October.""If you look at our cost performance in that region, we are the benchmark within the alliance,"" Mann said. ""Our four-by-four technology, our cost base on pickups is better than Nissan's.""Nissan snapped up Mitsubishi last year after the company admitted in April it had falsified fuel consumption data, triggering a sales slump and steep losses expected in the current fiscal year, which ends this month. Mitsubishi expects sales to bounce back above 1 million vehicles next year, Mann said, almost reversing their 8 percent decline from 1.05 million before the outcry.Nissan and Mitsubishi currently produce frame-based pickups and cars - which have fundamental design and manufacturing differences - on separate lines at each of their Thai plants.Moving to common architectures could potentially allow the Mitsubishi factory to specialize in pickups while the Nissan plant builds cars and SUVs, increasing productivity at both sites, Mann said, while stressing that nothing had been decided.Cooperation will rapidly extend to other countries in the region including Indonesia and the Philippines, where the companies have plants, Mann said. But pickups are likely to stay based in Thailand, where they account for 40 percent of sales.The current Navara and Triton models were launched in 2014 and are not due for replacement before 2022, which means development and production decisions may still be two or more years away.In the meantime, Nissan and Mitsubishi are already pooling car transport and other logistics while stepping up efforts to find more savings from joint purchasing. Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan, whose 18-year-old alliance is cemented by reciprocal minority shareholdings, are also likely to use Mitsubishi's plug-in hybrid technologies, Mann added. ""That's an obvious opportunity.""But Renault may have to wait longer than its alliance partner for the market access and savings that their new affiliate can bring.""What we have to do is prioritize,"" Mann said. ""We have the capital share with Nissan, so it's logical to start there.""Under Nissan ownership, Mitsubishi is still ""cleaning house"" in the wake of the fuel-economy data scandal, he added.""We're introducing a proper delegation of authority, risk control and business ethics in the company,"" Mann said. ""If we did uncover anything (else) which was not correct, we would disclose in an appropriate manner.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We have a responsibility to run an organization monitored by global society. And global society will not accept that,"" said Todt.""I'm sure if you said 'let's go back to engines from 10 years ago', many manufacturers would not support such a move. I'm convinced a minimum of three out of four would leave.""Formula One currently has Mercedes, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Honda as suppliers to its 10 teams.Ferrari, the most successful team in Formula One history that Todt led when seven-times champion Michael Schumacher was racing for them, have been in the championship since it started in 1950. The others have come and gone over the years.Todt said that stability was essential, given the huge costs involved in designing and producing engines, but recognized the sport had yet to find its ideal solution.Ross Brawn, the former Ferrari technical director and ex-Mercedes team principal who won titles with his own Brawn team in 2009, said last week that Formula One needed to identify what kind of engine it wanted.""Road transport is moving towards fuel cell or electric or different power trains,"" said the Briton, appointed in January as Formula One's managing director for motorsport, at a book presentation in Oxford.""There’s very strong feedback from the fans that noise is important.""So maybe we will reach a point where Formula One just steps aside from mainstream automotive and acknowledges that it’s a passionate sport and the engines are no longer relevant but they are still part of Formula One.""He added, however, that the sport wanted to keep the manufacturers on board.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Sonata is Hyundai Motor's second-biggest selling model after its Elantra in South Korea as well as the United States, and one of its top sellers in China. The stylish design and affordable price of the previous-generation Sonata, launched in 2009, propelled Hyundai Motor to its biggest-ever share of the U.S. market, and helped it escape an industry-wide downturn largely unscathed.But its curvy styling received mixed reviews in the conservative home market of South Korea, prompting the automaker to tone it down in 2014.With the latest version, Hyundai Motor has changed the sheet metal in an unusual move for a non-generational update. It has also given it a more sporty look with a curvy hood and a bigger grille. Lee said Hyundai Motor's next-generation Sonata will take design cues from this redesigned version.Hyundai Motor is working on next generation cars with ""a different flair"" for marketing from 2019, Luc Donckerwolke, senior vice president for design, previously told Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

888,"Mar 06, 2017 07:40AM ET","GM shifts from bigger is better to less global, more profitable",nan,"By Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co’s (N:GM) decision to sell its European operations doubles down on a bet that the company can win by being less global, but more profitable, in an auto industry increasingly driven by software. Without the German Opel and British Vauxhall brands, GM last year would have sold about 8.8 million vehicles -- well behind Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) in the race to be the world's largest automaker by vehicle sales.Opel and Vauxhall combined sold nearly 1.2 million vehicles in 2016, and generated $18.7 billion in revenue, about 11 percent of GM's total. However, all of GM's activity in Europe - the investments in new model designs and cleaner engines, the efforts to make factories more efficient and the wages paid to 38,000 employees - has generated nothing but losses since 1999. Meanwhile, GM's business in North America has boomed. GM's home market operations were reborn as a smaller company due in part to the U.S. government led bankruptcy in 2009, with fewer brands, fewer dealers, fewer employees and far less money owed to creditors and retirees. Since 2009, cheap gasoline has powered a boom in sales of high-profit pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, lifting GM's North American pre-tax profit margins to just over 10 percent in 2016. To keep its North American profit machine revved up, GM will have to invest in new SUVs and trucks, as well as expensive technology to enable those trucks to meet rising federal fuel economy targets.Europe is demanding cleaner cars, too. But far less of the technology GM would buy to clean up European diesels and tiny gasoline engines would be useful in the United States, where larger gasoline engines – including eight cylinder motors used in pickup trucks – dominate the market. GM has concluded that it cannot achieve significant economies of scale in emissions technology for Europe on its own, company executives said.  Peugeot  Chief Executive Carlos Tavares is wagering that he now can gain an advantage against rivals such as  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen AG with the help of the added revenue and sales volume provided by Opel.France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP), the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, announced a deal to buy GM's Opel division on Monday.GM's decision to walk away from Western Europe highlights two other profound shifts since 2009, when GM's board scuttled a deal to sell Opel and Vauxhall to a group led by auto supplier Magna International (TO:MG) and Russia's Sberbank.The first is China, now the world's largest auto market with roughly 28 million vehicles sold in 2016, and more growth forecast to come.As China grows, GM will need to shift more vehicle engineering money and capital investment to feed that market - which could eventually replace much of the global sales volume sacrificed by the sale of Opel to Peugeot SA (PA:PEUP). GM's Buick brand, its primary brand in China, and the Wuling brand of small commercial vehicles GM builds with partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, each outsold Opel and Vauxhall in 2016. The second factor is the race to transform cars into electrified, intelligent devices that are paid for by the mile instead of purchased on installment plans.Asked last month whether GM needed more radical restructuring to lift its share price, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra pointed to ""the way that we are investing in the future, which I think is a huge opportunity, with transportation-as-a-service,"" and to ""the opportunity that technology has to transform this industry"" as factors that could change how the company is valued. However, investors have not changed their views yet. Gary Silberg, head of KPMG's [KPMG.UL] Americas automotive practice, said that when it comes to the digital systems and the people required to collect, analyze and manipulate the terabytes of data required to make a car drive itself, Silicon Valley companies such as Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and ride services leader Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] have the edge.""The war for talent is absolutely essential to winning in the market place,"" Silberg said. And those adept in artificial intelligence systems ""are not going to work for the auto industry."" GM demonstrated the new economics of the industry last year when it agreed to pay $500 million - and potentially more - to buy a tiny San Francisco robotic driving technology startup, Cruise Automation.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) followed suit with a $1 billion deal to bring aboard and fund the future work of robotic vehicle startup Argo AI.GM's Barra has told investors that GM would deliver 20 percent or better returns on invested capital, and hold capital spending roughly flat with current levels of $9 billion a year, putting extra cash into share buybacks.Those constraints on capital force tough decisions, Barra and other senior GM executives have said. The decision to abandon Opel after nearly 80 years is the most momentous yet, and the success or failure of the bet could define Barra's legacy.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

889,"Mar 06, 2017 05:51AM ET",PSA targets Opel turnaround as GM exits Europe,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Edward TaylorPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) has agreed to buy Opel from General Motors (N:GM) in a deal valuing the business at 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), creating a new European car giant to challenge market leader Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).The maker of  Peugeot  and Citroen cars vowed to return Opel and its British Vauxhall brand to profit, targeting an operating margin of 2 percent within three years and 6 percent by 2026 underpinned by 1.7 billion euros in joint cost savings.PSA shares jumped as much as 5.2 percent after Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said GM's European arm could be turned around using lessons from the French group's own recovery. Opel recently recorded its 16th consecutive full-year loss.""We're confident that the Opel-Vauxhall turnaround will significantly accelerate with our support,"" he said.By acquiring Opel, PSA leapfrogs French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) to become Europe's second-ranked carmaker by sales, with a 16 percent market share to VW's 24 percent.The disposal seals GM's exit from Europe and ends a relationship dating back to the 1920s.Eight years after coming close to a sale to Canada's Magna (TO:MG), the Detroit car giant has faced renewed investor pressure to offload the business to raise profitability, rather than chase the global sales crown currently held by VW.Last year, PSA and GM Europe recorded a combined 72 billion euros in revenue and 4.3 million vehicle deliveries.GM will receive 1.32 billion euros for the Opel manufacturing business in the form of 650 million euros in cash and 670 million in PSA share warrants.An additional 900 million euros will be paid by the Paris-based carmaker and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) for Opel's financing arm, to be operated jointly and consolidated by the French bank.'PROUD NOT RELIEVED'After fending off 2015 merger overtures by  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) with support from her board, GM boss Mary Barra agreed to target a 20 percent return on invested capital and pay out more cash to shareholders.""The way I look at this is positioning Opel-Vauxhall to be incredibly successful in the future,"" Barra said on Monday when asked by a reporter whether she was relieved.""General Motors doesn't have to be relieved,"" PSA's Tavares interjected. ""They can be proud of giving Opel-Vauxhall a better future.""PSA shares were up 2.2 percent at 19.49 euros as of 0939 GMT, after reaching 20.06 euros earlier in the session. GM shares closed 1.2 percent higher on Friday after Reuters reported a deal had been struck.The two carmakers, which already share some production in an existing European alliance, confirmed last month they were negotiating PSA's outright acquisition of Opel, sparking concern over possible job cuts.Tavares said on Monday the targeted savings would come from purchasing and research and development - avoiding plant closures - as the Opel lineup is redeveloped with PSA technology and vehicle architectures.An ambitious technical convergence push will begin with the Opel Corsa, the CEO indicated, as earlier reported by Reuters.The next version of the popular subcompact will be delayed by a year to 2020 as it goes back to the drawing board, according to presentation slides shown to analysts.""Our planning teams are already working on that,"" Tavares said when questioned about the model. Another five PSA-based Opel vehicles will follow by 2023.LABOR COSTSThe Opel deal caps a stellar two-year recovery for PSA, which avoided bankruptcy in 2014 by selling 14 percent stakes to the French state and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489), matching the Peugeot family's diluted holding.Tavares has since cut about 3,000 French assembly line jobs each year through voluntary departures to trim the wage bill to 11 percent of revenue from the 15 percent level he inherited - which is roughly where Opel's labor costs stand today. PSA reiterated pledges to run Opel as a distinct German subsidiary and honor existing job guarantees, which tend to cover production plans for existing models. Beyond those horizons, however, the outlook for Opel plants may be less certain.""Tavares wants to create healthy competition between the plants,"" said one person involved in the tie-up talks. ""They will be competing for workload.""With Europe's auto market near a peak, some analysts expect the new group to close two or three plants within five years. Britain's European Union exit adds to the uncertainty over Vauxhall's UK plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.But Tavares said exports could help fill Opel plants, adding that UK manufacturing brought opportunities as well as risks in the event of a ""hard Brexit"" in which Britain leaves the EU without a free-trade deal.""This may look to you a little bit romantic,"" he conceded.The transaction also sees GM retain most of Opel's pensions deficit, estimated by analysts at $10 billion. Earlier in the talks, the U.S. carmaker had sought to offload a larger share of the liabilities, sources said.Some smaller pension funds will be transferred to PSA, along with a 3 billion euro payment to cover their full settlement, the companies said on Monday.Existing Opel models will be barred from entering new overseas markets under ""non-compete"" agreements that had also complicated negotiations - while GM will be similarly excluded from marketing the same underlying technologies in Europe.The PSA warrants, exercisable in five years and maturing in nine, provide a financial incentive for GM to continue cooperating. The U.S. carmaker has agreed to sell the shares received upon exercise, keeping no stake in PSA.The Opel sale cuts GM's cash balance requirement by $2 billion, the company said, allowing it to accelerate share repurchases. GM will also take a charge of $4 billion to $4.5 billion on the deal, expected to close in late 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Between them, PSA and GM Europe recorded 71.6 billion euros ($76 billion) in revenue and 4.3 million vehicle deliveries last year.The tie-up was approved on Friday by the PSA supervisory board, on which the French government, Peugeot family and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489) are represented as shareholders, one source with knowledge of the matter said.Spokespeople for PSA and Opel declined further comment.The two carmakers, which already share some production in an existing European alliance, confirmed last month they were negotiating an outright acquisition of Opel and its British Vauxhall brand by Paris-based PSA, sparking widespread concern over possible job cuts.In their jointly issued invitation to a Paris press conference at 0815 GMT on Monday, PSA and GM gave no indication of its subject. Separate briefings for the German press and Opel unions are expected to be held the same day.Sources close to the talks had reported progress on Thursday after the carmakers narrowed differences on a near-$10 billion Opel pension deficit and other issues. GM's European arm recently posted a 16th consecutive year of losses.The negotiations had encountered problems over GM demands that a PSA-owned Opel be barred from competing against its own Chevrolet lineup in markets including China, they said.But the ""non-compete"" issues were finally resolved as GM agreed to inject ""substantially more"" into the pensions than the $1 billion to $2 billion it had initially offered, another person said. The sources declined to give further details. Detroit-based GM, which came close to selling Opel to Magna (TO:MG) in 2009, has faced investor pressure to offload its struggling European arm and focus on raising profitability rather than chase the global sales crown currently held by VW.After fending off 2015 merger overtures by Fiat Chrysler with support from her board, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra agreed to target a 20 percent minimum return on invested capital and pay out more cash to shareholders.For PSA, the Opel deal caps a stellar two-year recovery under cost-cutting CEO Carlos Tavares, who said on Feb. 23 he would apply the same methods to Opel if the deal went through. PSA averted bankruptcy by selling 14 percent stakes to France and Dongfeng in 2014, to match a diluted Peugeot family holding.The acquisition offered an ""opportunity to create a European car champion"" and quickly exceed 5 million annual vehicle sales, Tavares told analysts as he presented full-year earnings. PSA also expects savings of up to 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) from the tie-up, sources have said.Tavares also told his board that PSA would redevelop the Opel lineup with its own technologies to achieve rapid savings, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

891,"Mar 03, 2017 06:01AM ET",Infiniti hints at F1-inspired high-performance car,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING (Reuters) - Infiniti, Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) premium brand, will display a concept car at next week's Geneva motor show that will hint at a new ""Formula One-inspired"" high-performance model based on its Q60 coupe.Developing such a premium-sport grade car could help Infiniti stand out from the crowded luxury automobile market, with a sporty-but-greener image.Dubbed the Infiniti Black S, the show car represents ""the maximum level of performance and dynamic capability of cars offered under the Infiniti name,"" the brand's global chief Roland Krueger said in a phone interview on Friday.For the greener bit, he added: ""We try to offer the best of both worlds. We have a very powerful engine, but at the same time the fuel economy and emissions standards are also very good.""The potential development is a collaboration between Infiniti and Nissan's alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and its F1 racing team, using F1 electric hybrid powertrain technology, among others.Krueger said it's not yet clear when any production Black S model would be showroom-ready.A new model wouldn't use exactly the same technologies as those in the Renault F1 car, he said, but would borrow from the ""philosophy"" of the race car to harvest energy from the car and use that to accelerate its performance.Infiniti would engineer the car to be ""a performance car, but in a marketable way,"" Krueger added.A hybrid powertrain being explored through Project Black S would likely use the energy recovery system required in F1 cars - taking the gasoline engine's exhaust gas to spin a small turbine to generate electricity which can then be used to boost the car's power and torque.Infiniti last year moved from being a sponsor of Renault's F1 team to becoming a technical partner.BRAND PRIORITIESNissan said last year it plans to equip some Infiniti cars with a gasoline engine with the efficiency of a diesel engine.With variable compression technology, the new engine can at any time choose an optimal compression ratio for combustion – a key factor in the trade-off between power and efficiency in petrol engines.The technology, which Krueger said will be available in an Infiniti model to be launched early next year, gives the performance of a turbo-charged gasoline engine while matching the power and economy of today's diesel and hybrid powertrains.""We have two main (brand priority) pillars: One is styling, the other is forward-thinking technologies,"" Krueger said, citing the new variable compression engine and the F1-inspired hybrid performance powertrain.Infiniti said on Friday it sold 20,114 vehicles globally in February, up 21 percent from a year earlier. Its sales for 2016 rose 7 percent to 231,000 vehicles.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We've done a lot to improve the business but we're exploring opportunities to see if we can accelerate that even more because scale does matter in this business,"" she said. ""We're continuing the dialogue.""Barra also said that the automaker backs corporate tax reform, but raised concerns about a Republican ""border adjustment"" tax proposal. ""If not done very thoughtfully it could be problematic,"" she said, saying tax reform needs to avoid ""unintended consequences.""The planned border adjustment tax would impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods while providing write-offs for goods that are exported. Some automakers have raised concerns about the tax, especially because all U.S.-built vehicles include a significant number of foreign-produced parts. NO TIMETABLESome reports in Europe have suggested GM could have a deal with PSA as early as next week, but Barra declined to discuss a timetable.PSA, the Paris-based maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars, and Detroit-based GM confirmed on Feb. 14 they were in talks over a PSA-Opel tie-up to create Europe's second-largest carmaker by sales after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).Acquiring GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands would give PSA a 16.3 percent share of the European passenger car market, vaulting it ahead of French rival  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).PSA and GM have tried before to combine their small cars in the failed centerpiece of a ""global strategic alliance"" unveiled in 2012, and rapidly scaled back to three shared projects from 40 initially considered.Last week, German magazine Der Spiegel reported GM told Peugeot it would only sell licenses for the manufacture of Opel cars to the French company if it agreed not to sell the vehicles in North America, Russia or China.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I think he was a bit disappointed with how F1 had been in the last four or five years and I think he needs to fall back in love with it and then his comments will be a lot more positive. So hopefully this car helps do that.""MCLAREN PROBLEMSThe immediate signs did not look promising, with Alonso having to sit out most of Monday morning due to an oil system problem and Belgian team mate Stoffel Vandoorne sidelined for much of Tuesday with engine problems.Alonso managed just 29 laps on Monday, compared to world champions Mercedes who put in 152, and Vandoorne did 40 on Tuesday.McLaren have not won a race since 2012 and have struggled for reliability and performance in two seasons with Honda. Alonso has also been vocal against the need to save fuel and tyres in recent years.He revealed to reporters last week at the launch of his new McLaren that he was contacted by Mercedes after world champion Nico Rosberg's sudden retirement in December, and Sainz said he had been too.""I’m not going to lie, they asked about my contract situation with Red Bull but Red Bull was fully clear that I had a contract signed for them for 2016 and the future. So there was nothing else going on,"" he said.In two seasons Sainz has earned a deserved reputation as a man to watch, a talent on the radar of teams bigger than Toro Rosso.He recognized that one day he would have to develop his career elsewhere, with Toro Rosso priding themselves on bringing through young talent, but like fellow Real Madrid fan Alonso he would not be considering his options until after the summer.""I told (principal) Franz (Tost) and the whole team: 'Look, it doesn’t matter what you read in the press or hear in the paddock',"" he said. ""I am so committed to Toro Rosso for this year and I am willing so badly to do well this year with Toro Rosso that I really don’t care of my future. We will have time over the summer and in the second half of the season.""I am 100 percent focused on this target that is this first half of the season to help Toro Rosso and myself, because at the end I also need another good year to position myself.""Sainz said he was convinced that, with a decent chassis and a switch from an old Ferrari engine to the latest Renault, the target of fifth overall in the constructors' standings was achievable for the Italy-based team.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That went to the Formula One commission and unfortunately was immediately rejected by the majority of teams.""The core Strategy Group incorporates the top teams only while all vote at the commission level.Horner hoped something could be agreed for 2018 to make the fins a one-season wonder because the cars would be more attractive without them.Red Bull have design ace Adrian Newey on their staff, a title-winner with three different teams and regarded as a master of aerodynamics.That has traditionally been a strong point for the team, who managed to win two races last year despite their  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine offering considerably less power than that of the dominant Mercedes.""I think it's wrong to ignore the aesthetics on a car,"" said Horner.

It said this month that it had asked Britain to extradite him.Mallya, who has a base in London as well as a country home bought from the father of triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, moved to Britain last March after banks sued to recover some $1.4 billion the Indian authorities say is owed by Kingfisher.He has dismissed the charges against him, saying last month that ""not one rupee was misused"".""The government-owned banks are trying to hold me personally responsible for the failure of India’s largest airline and to repay their debts,"" Mallya told Reuters in an interview at the launch of his team's 2017 car.""I have a counter claim on them as well. That is in the judicial system right now. ""Recovery of loans made to a PLC is a purely civil matter. The central bureau of investigation, at the behest of the government, converted it into a criminal matter.

Unafraid to trample over long-standing business customs, he became a hero in Japan and one of the auto industry's best known executives.Ghosn, 62, will continue to be chairman at Nissan, a position he also holds at Renault and Mitsubishi. He also leaves in his place a man cut from very similar cloth.Saikawa is a veteran cost-cutter with much of his career spent in managing purchasing and supply chains. The 63-year old was named the company's chief competitive officer in 2013, became co-CEO last November and also currently heads Japan's auto industry lobby.""The timing is a bit surprising,"" said Takeshi Miyao, Asia managing director at consultancy Carnorama. ""It appears Ghosn has decided very quickly that Saikawa is the right person to lead the company.""Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Ghosn began his career at  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France, moving on to Renault, where he oversaw a turnaround of the automaker.He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its CEO in 2001. Nissan is the strongest of automakers in the alliance, long outperforming Renault in terms of vehicle sales and profits, while Mitsubishi still needs an overhaul after a mileage cheating scandal last year.Bringing Mitsubishi into the fold has put the three-way alliance on par with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) - all producing around 10 million vehicles annually.That has brought an opportunity to benefit from scale but also the challenge of balancing the interests of all three automakers.""Ghosn is likely to focus on strengthening and raising profitability at all the alliance members so that they are not overly dependent on Nissan,"" said Miyao.""Even if the alliance as a whole produces 10 million cars, if 3 million of those cars are not profitable it will be difficult for the alliance to continue.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A PSA spokesman declined to comment on the deal talks or the French carmaker's objectives.The sales goal of 5 million vehicles, to be reached between 2020 and 2022, represents a 16 percent increase on last year's combined 4.3 million deliveries by PSA and Opel. It may be viewed as ambitious, with the European auto market now approaching a peak. The future of Opel's sales financing arm and 7 billion euro pension deficit is still under discussion, two sources said.Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Dominic O'Brien earlier said that savings of 2 billion euros could be achieved with 1.2 billion euros from joint purchasing, 400 million euros from R&D and a 400 million euros from the eventual elimination of 6,000 jobs.""The most obvious starting point for any restructuring, of course, lies with labour,"" O'Brien said in a note to clients, adding that layoffs would be more likely ""via attrition and voluntary rather than compulsory"".PSA said its Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had a ""constructive discussion"" with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday, repeating assurances given to German Chancellor Angela Merkel a day earlier that any existing GM commitments to unions would be honored.GM's current German job guarantees run to the end of next year and plant commitments until around 2019-20, unions say.The new group would have 75 billion euros in revenue and a 16 percent combined European market share, which shrank last year as both groups lost ground to rivals including VW and  Renault  (PA:RENA).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We have no idea what anyone else is doing, they don't know what we are doing,"" said Palmer.""We will hit the track in Barcelona (at the first pre-season test next week) and see some sort of form guide, I guess. But compared to the last few years it is a real chance for someone to upset the form book.""Early on I think there will be a chance if someone really gets the race right to make a big jump.""A downside of the more aggressive and quicker cars is that drivers face tougher physical demands on them as they experience greater G-forces in cornering.That means bulking up, putting on some muscle and strengthening the neck. Palmer has put on three to four kilos compared to last season, most of it on the upper body.For once, he could enjoy the 'full works' at Christmas dinner.""For years I've been trying to lean down and save weight and now I've got to try to bulk up for once... it's going to be very physical and hopefully it pays off.

904,"Feb 19, 2017 10:01AM ET",Ford sees big Russia gamble vindicated as sales finally turn corner,nan,"By Jack Stubbs and Gleb StolyarovMOSCOW (Reuters) - Ford (N:F) has become the first major foreign carmaker in Russia to see sales grow after three bad years, potentially vindicating its decision to double down on a notoriously volatile market when rivals decided to cut and run.Sales of cars in Russia have fallen by more than half since a 2012 peak of 2.9 million vehicles, due to an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices and Western sanctions. The market fell by 11 percent last year, and was down a further 5 percent in January from a year earlier. Ford's big U.S. rival General Motors (N:GM) pulled out of Russia two years ago. But Ford chose not only to stay, but to keep investing, launching new models with modifications designed to suit the country's harsh driving conditions.Since 2011, its joint venture with Sollers , a Russian partner, has ploughed $1.5 billion into making cars locally to local specifications.Now Ford's sales have turned a corner and rose 10 percent last year, an achievement the company says is proof its strategy is at last paying off.The 40,000 Fords sold in Russia last year are still barely more than a fifth of the almost 190,000 vehicles the company sold in 2008, before the global financial crisis brought the first of two collapses in the Russian car industry in less than a decade.During the latest crisis, Ford's share of the market for foreign cars fell at the expense of Korean competitors Kia (KS:000270) and Hyundai (KS:005380), which chose to shore up market share through aggressive pricing. But now their sales are still falling, while Ford's are on the rise. The Russian market is ""starting to turn"", Ford CEO Mark Fields told Reuters last week, promising to stand by the company's investments in Russia. ""Our intent is to build on that.""The Association of European Businesses lobby group forecasts the Russian car market to finally stabilize this year and grow by 4 percent. But it will still be years before a full rebound.""Despite the economic turbulence, we didn't cut investments and delivered the initial plan to launch seven new vehicles with a significant level of localization,"" Mark Ovenden, CEO of the Ford Sollers joint venture, told Reuters.He noted that the company opened a $275 million engine plant in 2015, a year in which Ford's Russia sales nosedived 41 percent. The joint venture now operates four plants in Russia.New models, such as the Fiesta hatchback and EcoSport SUV, have been adapted for Russian conditions of bad roads and extreme cold, with higher ground clearance, anti-corrosion finishes and engines adapted for lower grade fuel, Ovenden said.Ford would not say when it thinks its Russian operations will earn money. A spokeswoman declined to comment on profitability in Russia, saying Ford does not break down its European operations by individual market.Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at Russia's VTB bank, said Ford's Russian operations were still loss-making but could be profitable as soon as 2018.IHS analysts predict Ford's sales in Russia could rise to 60,000 vehicles by 2020. ""But it's going to be a long, slow build up,"" said Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive.Even at such small numbers, sales growth in Russia would mark a bright spot for Ford's European operations after it warned last month that the impact of Britain's vote to leave the EU would put a $600 million dent in its 2017 earnings.""POINT OF NO RETURN""Russia has been one of the great dream markets for carmakers since the automobile was invented.Ford first entered Russia in 1907 under the reign of Tsar Nicholas II, but foreign automakers were shut out during the Soviet era when Moscow built its own industry. Well into the 2000s, the market was still dominated by boxy Ladas built on a design licensed by the Soviets from Fiat in the 1960s, leaving huge pent-up demand for more comfortable and reliable models.A decade after the Soviet Union fell, Ford opened Russia's first foreign car plant in St Petersburg in 2002. By the time of its sales peak in 2008, some Russian automotive experts predicted the Ford Focus could become Russia's new national car.Although that ambition now seems far off, the decision to invest so heavily in building cars locally was one reason Ford decided to stay when GM left, said Bespalov.""Ford passed the point of no return in terms of investment,"" he said. ""Ford and GM were in different situations. For Ford the decision to continue to invest meant fewer losses than a decision to leave. For GM, it was the other way round.""Urquhart noted that GM had also been hurt worse than Ford globally by the 2009 downturn, giving it more reason to be cautious in the years that followed.While Ford saw sales grew last year, other foreign car companies suffered further falls, in line with the wider market.Kia, now Russia's second-biggest seller behind domestic top producer  Avtovaz  (MM:AVAZ), fell by 9 percent, and third-place Hyundai fell by 10 percent. France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), which sunk $1 billion into an initial 25 percent stake in now struggling Avtovaz in 2008, saw sales slide 3 percent last year.

Frenchman Jean-Eric Vergne was second in Saturday's race for the Chinese Techeetah team with Di Grassi, who started on pole position, third for Team Abt Schaeffler Audi Sport. Buenos Aires also saw the first demonstration run of two driverless 'Roborace' development, or 'DevBot', electric cars running on track together at speeds of up to 185kph but mostly slower.The cars used sensors and on-board systems to navigate the street circuit whilst communicating with each other to avoid contact but one of the two still crashed into barriers.A stray dog on the track posed an additional hazard.""This is an historic moment for Roborace and for the future of autonomous vehicle development,"" said Roborace chief executive Denis Sverdlov in a statement.""Seeing these two cars interacting at speed on a race track shows how fast the technology is progressing and how important a platform Roborace is for further development.""It is so exciting to see these vehicles functioning without any human intervention, making their own decisions and taking appropriate actions in order to guide themselves around the track.""Formula E organizers hope ultimately to have up to 10 driverless cars racing together, run by teams who write their own software, around city tracks as a support event to their series.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The state of Tamil Nadu has been in turmoil since its leader, film star turned politician Jayaraman Jalalithaa, died on Dec. 6, 2016 without naming a successor.Since then her close companion Sasikala has sought to take over the mantle of leadership of the AIADMK party, but earlier this week the federal Supreme Court convicted her of corruption and jailed her for four years.Hecklers surrounded the speaker for refusing to allow a secret ballot which the opposition group DMK believed would show up deep cracks in the ruling party. A DMK spokesman denied that his party colleagues created the ruckus.Known as the ""Detroit of Asia"", Tamil Nadu is India's second-largest manufacturing state.

911,"Feb 14, 2017 11:34AM ET",GM in talks to sell European auto business to Peugeot,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Edward TaylorLONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In a move that could shake up the global auto industry, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and French automaker PSA Group said on Tuesday they are in talks that could result in PSA buying GM's European auto operations.For PSA, owner of the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands, acquiring GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands would give it a 16.3 percent share of the European passenger car market, vaulting it into second place in the region, ahead of French rival  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and behind Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG.Any deal would have to overcome financial, industrial and political obstacles. Germany's industrial union IG Metall on Tuesday fired a warning shot, saying that if the companies were discussing the sale of Opel without the union's involvement, that would be an ""an unprecedented breach of all German and European co-determination rights."" German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said it was totally unacceptable that talks took place on French carmaker PSA Group buying GM's European Opel unit without consulting German works councils or local government.The French government, which owns 14 percent of PSA, could support a deal that would help PSA reach ""critical mass,"" an economy ministry source told Reuters. The government will ""give special attention to the impact in terms of jobs and the industrial impact of these initiatives,"" the source said. France is in the midst of a heated national election campaign. A spokesman for the Peugeot family, which holds a matching stake in the carmaker, was not immediately available. It was not clear what price GM might want for the loss-making European business, or what structure a deal could take.Both companies cautioned in statements that no deal is certain, but investors cheered the disclosure, sending shares in PSA, owner of the Peugeot and Citroen brands, up 3.7 percent and boosting GM shares by 3.5 percent in early New York trading.Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV rose 3.9 percent as investors speculated that one consolidation play could lead to another. Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has campaigned for more than a year for GM to combine with his company.BARRA'S GM STRATEGY: SMALLER, MORE PROFITABLEFor GM, selling Opel would be the most dramatic demonstration yet of Chief Executive Mary Barra's strategy of putting profitability and returns on invested capital ahead of market share. Since taking over as GM's CEO in January 2014, Barra has signed off on decisions to quit markets, including Russia and Indonesia, where GM lost money, pull the Chevrolet brand out of Europe, and slash sales to rental car fleets that long propped up U.S. market share with little or no profit. GM's global market share slipped by 0.3 percentage points last year. Selling Opel and Vauxhall, which added almost 1 million cars to its sales, could mean abandoning the global volume race in which it is currently ranked third behind Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp, with just over 10 million vehicles delivered last year.In 2015, Barra and GM's board quelled an attempt by an investor group to install representatives on the automaker's board by agreeing to return more cash to shareholders, and to target 20 percent or better returns on invested capital. GM executives said that measure drives them to put more money into high profit markets, such as trucks and SUVs in the United States, or growth opportunities such as developing autonomous cars for ride services, and less in low-earning businesses.In 2016, GM said its return on capital was 28.9 percent.Despite delivering robust profits and promising $9 billion in share buybacks between 2015 and 2017, GM shares are still trading below the $41 a share level they reached in December 2013, just before Barra took over as CEO.EUROPE IS A DRAGGM Europe has been a drag on the automaker's global profitability since 1999, the last year Opel and Vauxhall recorded a net profit. GM restructured its European operations over the past six years, shutting Opel factories in Belgium and Germany and withdrawing the Saab and Chevrolet brands from sale. Still, GM Europe failed to break even in 2016, as Barra had once promised it would, and the company said last week it did not expect profits in the operation until 2018.Going forward, GM faces the prospect of heavy investments to comply with European government and consumer demands for cleaner diesel vehicles, and to catch up with a rapid shift toward sport utility vehicles.GM had previously discussed a sale of its European auto business to Canadian parts maker Magna in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when GM was heading toward a U.S. government-led bankruptcy. But GM pulled the plug on the tentative deal in 2009.GM and PSA have already shared production of commercial vans and developed common vehicle platforms, a relic of their last attempt to forge a broader alliance, which was unwound in 2013 with the sale of the U.S. carmaker's stake in PSA.Selling Opel would free up GM to invest more to develop vehicles for the North American and Chinese markets, where it makes nearly all of its automotive profits, as well as to expand new businesses.It remains unclear how PSA would cut costs in a combined group. France's PSA has 10 factories in Europe and General Motors has 11 plants. Under Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, PSA has rebounded from a 2013-14 brush with bankruptcy to reach record levels of earnings, posting a 6.8 percent automotive operating margin in the first half of last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sasikala guilty in the disproportionate assets case, upholding a four-year jail term handed down by a lower court and banning her from seeking elected office for 10 years.The verdict delivered a decisive blow against Sasikala, who had emerged from the shadows after three decades as a low-profile adviser to claim the mantle of five-times Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram who died in December.Sasikala mounted a bid to oust Tamil Nadu's caretaker Chief Minister O.P. Paneerselvam, corralling lawmakers from their AIADMK party into a resort hotel in an attempt to stop them from defecting to her opponent's camp.Panneerselvam, addressing jubilant supporters outside his residence in Chennai, appealed for party unity.

It hosts auto makers including BMW, Daimler, Hyundai, Ford, Mitsubishi, Nissan and  Renault  (PA:RENA).Sasikala, who first won the favour of Jayalalithaa by making campaign films and went on to run the household of the actress-turned-politician, was ordered to turn herself in to a court in Bengaluru, capital of the neighbouring state of Karnataka, that convicted both in 2014.The disproportionate assets case was first filed in 1996 by Subramanian Swamy, a veteran lawyer and politician from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist ruling party. ""After 20 years, I won,"" Swamy said in a tweet.Jayalalithaa was jailed in 2014 for holding 530 million rupees ($8 million) in unaccounted cash and property accumulated during her first term in power. She stood down following the verdict only to be freed on bail, and returned to office months later.Sasikala was also a defendant in the case. She has been ordered to pay a fine of 100 million rupees ($1.5 million) and cannot appeal the verdict.""She may file a petition for review, but generally it is not entertained in criminal matters,"" said B.V. Acharya, who had earlier acted as a public prosecutor in the case.Representatives for Sasikala could not be reached for comment. Her party's official Twitter handle expressed its support for her, saying that whenever Jayalalithaa had been ""in despair"" Sasikala had ""shared the burden"".""She is doing the same now, truth will prevail,"" it said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It will become even harder for American companies to operate, that's for sure. We've opened up a lead and we plan to hold on to it.""Within two weeks of his inauguration, Trump responded to an Iranian missile test with fresh U.S. sanctions, warning that Tehran was ""playing with fire"".General Motors (N:GM) and other American-owned brands last had a significant Iranian presence before the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Other western and Japanese carmakers that had avoided Iran under recent sanctions are now eyeing its potential.

VW has said it cannot keep a large number of temporary staff on its books because of shrinking demand for models such as the Golf hatchback and Passat saloon.""We would welcome if the group's management would more strongly deal with the implementation of the future pact and the compliance with agreements,"" a works council spokesman said in an emailed statement.A spokesman for the VW brand confirmed that talks have been postponed, but declined further comment.But Mueller, in a letter to staff on Monday which was seen by Reuters, indicated he may get more directly involved.""We as group management and I personally will continue to do everything, so that conflicts are resolved in a constructive manner and VW will be protected from harm,"" he said. The so-called future pact will lead to 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and foresees 30,000 job cuts at the VW brand without forcing layoffs until 2025.This plan is seen by analysts as critical to raising profitability at VW's core division, which is lagging rivals including  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and Toyota (T:7203). Apart from VW, Volkswagen also owns the Audi, Skoda, SEAT, and Porsche marques.Europe's largest automaker is having to make cuts to its high-cost operations in Germany to fund a strategic shift and shed costs following the diesel emissions affair, which is costing it billions of dollars in settlements.($1 = 0.9401 euros)   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

919,"Feb 09, 2017 01:40PM ET",PSA Group referred to French prosecutors over diesel emissions,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) has been referred to prosecutors over suspected diesel emissions-cheating, the company said on Thursday.The decision is a blow for the Paris-based manufacturer of  Peugeot , Citroen and DS cars, whose diesel technology had until now escaped serious criticism in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions-cheating scandal. ""We are extremely surprised, even shocked by this decision,"" PSA engineering chief Gilles Le Borgne told reporters at the company's headquarters. The company denies using banned engine software cheats, he added.PSA is the fourth carmaker to be referred for possible prosecution by France's consumer fraud agency, after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA).Following VW's exposure in 2015 for U.S. diesel test-cheating, several European countries launched their own investigative test programs.They found on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits - for some GM (N:GM), Renault (PA:RENA) and Fiat (MI:FCHA) models - and widespread use of devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions.Carmakers have broadly invoked an EU legal loophole designed to allow such software only when it is necessary for safety or engine protection.PSA diesels under the current Euro 6 standard have cleaner emissions than many mass-market rivals, thanks to their deployment of costly selective catalytic reduction (SCR) as standard.But in a government-backed testing program last year, five PSA vehicles of the last Euro 5 diesel generation emitted significantly higher NOx in motorway driving conditions when engine temperatures were increased.By design, the cars' so-called EGR emissions treatment is deliberately reduced at higher temperatures to improve fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in out-of-town driving, where NOx and particle output is less critical, Le Borgne said.The company last year began an independently certified real-world CO2 emissions-testing program and began publishing results measured for all its vehicles on the road. ""We don't know what more we could have done,"" Le Borgne said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

920,"Feb 09, 2017 12:42PM ET","In French bellwether city, scandal deepens election uncertainty",nan,"By Patrick VignalCHARTRES, France (Reuters) - Chartres has in past decades been a bellwether for France's presidential elections, but ahead of this spring's poll the signal from this white-collar city appears to be blurred by a scandal that has fed into a wave of anti-establishment feeling.In at least the past four elections, the affluent city famous for its towering thirteenth century gothic cathedral has voted in close alignment with the final national result.Lying in the Beauce plain 90 km (56 miles) southwest of Paris, Chartres counts perfume makers including Guerlain (PA:LVMH) and Danish pharmaceutical firm  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) as local companies. It should be a fertile ground for center-right challenger Francois Fillon.The 62-year-old former prime minister's clean-cut, clean-living image had held appeal in Chartres, run for over 15 years by a conservative mayor. But embarrassing revelations that his family for years benefited from large parliamentary salaries have hurt that image. In a Reuters poll of 100 people in Chartres city center, more than half said their vote was undecided. The survey intends to provide a snapshot of views in a single location and is not intended to reflect nationwide opinions. For many in Chartres, the Fillon debacle was a factor behind their indecision.""We are living at a time when the word integrity is becoming meaningless for our politicians. We've had some blatant examples in the past week"", 86-year-old Maurice Beauzac told a Reuters multimedia team.Fillon looked a shoo-in for the Elysee palace before the scandal surfaced two weeks ago, campaigning on a free-market platform to reduce regulation and haul down the stubbornly high unemployment rate.Now opinion polls suggest he will crash out in the first round. So too will the candidate of the ruling Socialist Party, Benoit Hamon, the surveys indicate, as mainstream parties battle against a rising tide of populism across Europe.The favorites to reach the runoff vote on May 7 are the far-right National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen, and independent challenger Emmanuel Macron who has yet to release a full manifesto. Among those polled by Reuters in Chartres, 25 percent said unemployment was their number one concern, while 19 percent named a lack of integrity, or honesty, as their main worry.For a graphic on the Reuters poll: http://tmsnrt.rs/2kras5jFor a photo essay: http://reut.rs/2k3TE0J For an online video: http://reut.rs/2kqsmT3""FED UP""The high level of uncertainty in Chartres underlines how wide open the presidential race remains. It also points to the disaffection many voters feel towards the political elite.""People are becoming less and less interested in politics,"" said Sebastien  Renault  (PA:RENA), a 35-year-old florist. ""It's a world of sharks out there, one eating the other.""It is a sentiment that will worry the main political parties, especially in a place where unemployment runs almost two points below the national average of nearly 10 percent, and a median annual salary of 30,000 euros places it in the top 10 for cities of its small size.""Like France, Chartres is fed up with the traditional political system but it's not only linked with the recent affairs,"" said Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges. ""It's just that the situation in this country has been deteriorating for the past 40 years. Almost everybody has somebody in his family who is out of work.""France's outgoing president, Francois Hollande, was elected in 2012 on a promise to create jobs, winning the hearts of socialists by declaring banks to be his ""main enemy"" and pledging extra taxes for millionaires. But he later launched reforms -- including cutting corporate taxes and legislation to make it easier for companies to hire and fire -- that traditional socialists viewed as a betrayal of left-wing values. Now it is the anti-European Union Le Pen who rails against free-trade who is pitching herself as the true defender of French workers' interests.Against this backdrop, some in the National Front are optimistic the party will get a boost from the Fillon scandal.""I think all of this clearly plays in Marine's favor,"" said Aleksandar Nikolic, the youthful head of the National Front's regional branch. Nikolic expressed surprise that immigration and security ranked low among the concerns of those polled by Reuters.""When we ask the people here what their main concerns are, security and immigration clearly come first,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

921,"Feb 07, 2017 08:37PM ET",Exclusive: Italian diesel probe omitted key tests for Fiat Chrysler models,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Silvia AloisiPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) vehicles were allowed to skip key tests for illegal engine software during Italy's main emissions-cheating investigation in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal, according to the transport ministry's own report.The report, presented to a European parliamentary committee in October but never officially published, will be seized upon by environmental groups pressing MEPs to vote on Thursday for tougher EU oversight of vehicle testing by national authorities.""It's imperative that we break this cosy relationship between national testing authorities and their domestic carmakers,"" said Julia Poliscanova, a vehicle emissions specialist at Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment. ""This problem is at the heart of Dieselgate.""The Italian report may raise questions for Fiat Chrysler (FCA) as it faces a U.S. criminal investigation for alleged emissions manipulation and German accusations that it, like VW (DE:VOWG_p), used ""defeat devices"" to confound nitrogen oxide (NOx) tests.FCA on Monday became the third carmaker after VW and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to be referred to French prosecutors over the scandal. The Italian-American company denies breaking any laws, a spokesman reiterated, declining further comment.The ministry findings, which have been circulated by some Italian opposition politicians and examined by Reuters, include complete sets of data for eight diesel cars made by BMW (DE:BMWG), Ford (N:F), Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen and GM's (N:GM) Opel.But for three of the seven FCA models also investigated - a Jeep Cherokee 2.0, Alfa Romeo Giulietta 1.6 and Lancia Ypsilon 1.3 - results are missing from an on-road measurement phase and a reversed version of the EU's standard ""NEDC"" lab test.All seven FCA models also lack data for an ""Artemis"" test that adjusts the EU lab regime to reflect urban driving styles. The three skipped protocols are typically used to help unmask defeat devices by preventing them from detecting the test.No explanation for the missing FCA results was offered in the document. But transport ministry spokeswoman Luisa Gabbi told Reuters a ""new definitive version"" had been drafted to include more data for FCA models following further tests, and would be published in coming weeks. ""No key test has been omitted for FCA,"" she said.Following VW's exposure in 2015 for U.S. diesel test-cheating, several European countries launched their own investigative test programs.Their results revealed on-road NOx emissions as high as 15 times the regulatory limits, as well as the widespread use of defeat devices that reduce exhaust treatment in some conditions.LOOPHOLEFCA is among carmakers including Renault and GM that have broadly invoked an EU legal loophole designed to allow such software only when it is necessary for safety or engine protection. All deny breaking the law.In German and French testing, a Jeep Cherokee 2.0-litre similar to the model overlooked by Italian engineers emitted between 5.3 and 9.9 times the legal NOx limit under modified EU test cycles conducted in the lab or on the road.Independent road testing of a Fiat 500L with the same 1.6-litre engine as the omitted Alfa Giulietta measured NOx levels more than 5.6 times the statutory 180 milligrams per kilometer for Euro 5 engines, according to UK-based Emissions Analytics.According to the Italian report, the FCA models were all analyzed in Fiat's own labs under the supervision of ministry officials, while all other models were tested at an independent Istituto Motori facility. The draft regulation before MEPs would bolster EU oversight of government testing authorities to address perceived conflicts of interest when they inspect and certify the cars of their own national manufacturing champions.Brussels would get powers to carry out vehicle spot-checks and allow national authorities to peer-review one another's decisions. Under current rules, a vehicle certification is valid EU-wide but can be revoked only by the country that issued it.Lawmakers on the European Parliament's internal market committee are expected to approve the draft with only minor amendments on Thursday, setting the stage for a plenary vote.The European Commission, which drew up the proposals last year, is mediating in a related dispute after Germany accused Italian regulators of failing to act on evidence that FCA models including the Fiat 500X use banned defeat devices.A spokeswoman for the EU executive declined to comment on the Italian diesel report but emphasized the need for change.""Member states have so far wanted to keep exclusive responsibility,"" Lucia Caudet said. ""But this system has failed.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

922,"Feb 06, 2017 05:50PM ET",French investigators refer Fiat Chrysler emissions case to prosecutor,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have referred carmaker  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) for possible prosecution over abnormal emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollutants from some of its diesel engines, the government said on Monday.The investigation, launched in the wake of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) emissions test-cheating scandal, revealed emissions from Fiat Chrysler models that were several times higher than regulatory limits.A file on Fiat Chrysler has been passed to prosecutors, a statement from the finance and industry ministry said, while investigations into other car brands continue.The referral makes FCA the third manufacturer to be referred to French prosecutors, after Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and France's  Renault  (PA:RENA).The referral follows a testing program carried out by French regulators last year for a number of different carmakers. According to findings published last July, FCA's Jeep Cherokee model emitted eight times the NOx limit on a slightly modified regulatory lab test. Its Fiat 500x model emitted almost 17 times the limit in road testing, the report said. Fiat Chrysler could not immediately be reached for comment. FCA has already come into the spotlight after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) last month accused the American-Italian carmaker of using hidden software to allow excessive diesel emissions to go undetected, leaving it facing a maximum fine of about $4.6 billion.FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne angrily rejected the U.S. allegations, saying there was no wrongdoing and FCA never sought to create software to cheat emissions rules. He also stressed FCA's situation cannot be compared with VW's. Tensions have also arisen between Rome and Berlin after Germany raised concerns over FCA's Fiat 500X, Fiat Doblo and Jeep Renegade models, alleging that they were equipped with illegal cheating software. FCA rejects the allegations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

And yet, if Lando Norris keeps on winning, a South-West successor to the 2009 world champion -- who made his F1 debut in 2000 -- may not be too far down the road.The 17-year-old Glastonbury-based racer has caught the eye in karting and junior series and now has a first Formula One test with Button's McLaren team lined up.""My ambition is to be in Formula One and be a champion in Formula One,"" he told Reuters.""If I’m able to get onto a junior program or something... 2019 could be a good chance (to reach F1). It’s kind of just around the corner from what I’ve been doing.""Such sentiments are not unusual in the junior formulae, before reality all too often sinks in, and there are others with strong claims such as 18-year-old George Russell who this week joined the young driver program of world champions Mercedes.But Norris, who rode bikes before taking up karting at seven and is a big fan of MotoGP great Valentino Rossi, is building impressive credentials.He was a world go-karting champion at the age of 14 in 2014 and followed in Button's footsteps last year by winning the McLaren BRDC (British Racing Drivers' Club) Autosport award.The prize includes a Formula One test and simulator role with the former champions, as well as use of the team's training facilities.""He definitely has a great career in front of him. Lando’s a future F1 driver and I believe a future F1 World Champion,"" commented BRDC president Derek Warwick at the time.Norris, who turned 17 in November and has yet to find the time to take a driving test or schedule any lessons after doing 63 races last year, aims to use the opportunity ""to learn what an F1 car is like, obviously the speed and the grip.""And if something does come of that, perfect.""Last year he won the Toyota Racing Series in New Zealand as well as the Formula  Renault  (PA:RENA) Eurocup and Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup and also finished eighth in British Formula Three despite missing half the season.In 2015, he won the inaugural MSA Formula title and this season he will be competing in the same Euro F3 championship that propelled Red Bull's Max Verstappen, Force India's Esteban Ocon and Williams' Lance Stroll into Formula One.Seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher's son Mick will be one of his opponents.""If I can have a great season this year... then that will open me up to more opportunities with possibly joining a junior team or something. And then we’ll have to see where it goes from there,"" said Norris.""At this point I’m not on any junior team so my whole focus is just F3. There’s not really been a plan put in place for next year because of what could happen."" Like Canadian Stroll, the 18-year-old billionaire's son who will make his F1 debut in Australia in March, Norris has money behind him but expects to progress on merit.""I’m fortunate enough that my Dad’s able to pay for everything that I’ve done so far. I wouldn’t want to go into Formula One having to pay for everything,"" he said.""I prefer earning my way into it by showing that I have the ability to be good, and fast and from that a team picks me up.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

929,"Jan 19, 2017 10:34AM ET",Davos CEOs 'go local' on supply chain in Trump era,nan,"By Martinne Geller and Ben HirschlerDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Business leaders in Davos, traditionally the high priests of globalization, are talking up the benefits of local production this week to shield themselves from criticism from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump.Elected on a jobs-focused ""America First"" platform, Trump has taken to Twitter to rebuke major companies like General Motors (N:GM),  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and United Technologies (N:UTX), either for making goods in Mexico or for the price of their products.At this week's World Economic Forum (WEF), a gathering of business and political elites in the Swiss Alps synonymous with free markets, company bosses said they were now preparing to adjust to the Trump era. ""The basic message is to be more national, don't just be global,"" Richard Edelman, CEO of communications marketing firm Edelman, told Reuters. ""Let's try and pre-empt that tweet by having a long-term discussion about the supply chain.""General Motors on Tuesday highlighted moves it said would add nearly 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, including a decision to shift some production of axles to an American factory, rather than have them supplied from Mexico. The automaker said it wanted to ""build where we sell"".""There is no doubt we need to adapt,"" Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201), told Reuters. ""All carmakers have to revise their strategy as a function of what is coming.""At the same time, companies are reviewing potential mergers and rethinking job cuts, fearing the stigma of being labeled ""anti-American"".What companies have yet to spell out is the economic cost of such shifts or the extent of localization that will be needed to keep the peace with the new White House administration. TAX REFORMAdding to the incentive to increase U.S. manufacturing is the promise of lower corporate taxes under the Trump administration. ""It could mean increased investment in the U.S.,""  Novartis  (S:NOVN) CEO Joe Jimenez told Reuters.Vishal Sikka, chief executive of  Infosys  (NS:INFY), which provides IT services to large companies including banks, said his company expected more business from helping companies localize.""The irony is that when more walls show up it is a good opportunity for services companies to help do business across those walls,"" he said. The move to go local in response to Trump looks set to fuel a trend already evident in some industries, including food and fashion, which are trying to tap into consumer demand for homegrown materials and production.Other businesses are also thinking locally to mitigate currency risks in certain markets. Food companies in Britain, for example, which have seen their costs soar after sterling plummeted in the wake of the Brexit vote, have started moving toward local suppliers where possible to keep costs down. In some cases, technological advances are helping by making it easier for companies to shorten their supply lines.""With 3D printing, for example, some of the supply chain will reshore and come back to the local economies,"" said Frans van Houten, CEO of Dutch healthcare technology group Philips (AS:PHG). ""I think we will see supply chains becoming more regional.""Such tech-fueled localization may be a competitive advantage for multinational companies in a world of increasing geopolitical uncertainty, but it brings fresh challenges for developing economies which could lose out as jobs return to richer countries like the United States.Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP (L:WPP), the world's largest advertising agency, said U.S. growth could come at the cost of nations elsewhere.""The issue on Trump is what you win on the U.S. swings, you may lose on the international roundabouts,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

931,"Jan 16, 2017 01:00PM ET",Trump threatens German carmakers with 35 percent U.S. import tariff,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Andreas RinkeFRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S President-elect Donald Trump warned German car companies he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market, a plan that drew sharp rebukes from Berlin and hit the automakers' shares.In an interview with German newspaper Bild, published on Monday, Trump criticized German carmakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) for failing to produce more cars on U.S. soil.""If you want to build cars in the world, then I wish you all the best. You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax,"" Trump said in remarks translated into German.""I would tell BMW that if you are building a factory in Mexico and plan to sell cars to the USA, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that,"" Trump said.Volkswagen (VW) shares closed down 2.2 percent, while BMW and Daimler's shares ended 1.5 percent lower.Under pressure to deliver on campaign promises to revive U.S. industrial jobs, Trump has turned his fire on carmakers that use low-cost Mexican plants to serve the U.S. market. He has also warned Japan's Toyota (T:7203) it could be subject to a ""big border tax"" if it builds its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a planned factory in Mexico.All three German carmakers have invested heavily in Mexico, but also pointed out on Monday that they manufacturer in the United States as well. BMW executive Peter Schwarzenbauer told reporters the company was sticking to plans to invest around $1 billion in a new plant in Mexico, which is due to go into production in 2019 and create at least 1,500 jobs.SERIOUS WARNING""The president's powers are considerable. He can legally impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days. Trump is not constrained by Congress,"" said Simon Evenett, professor of international trade at Switzerland's University of St Gallen.""Even if foreign companies object and seek to challenge the legality of tariffs, it will take at least 18 months to get decided. Corporate strategies will be disrupted by then.""While investing in Mexico, German carmakers have quadrupled light vehicle production in the United States over the past seven years to 850,000 units, more than half of which are exported from there, Germany's VDA automotive industry association said.""In the long term, the United States would be shooting itself in the foot by imposing tariffs or other trade barriers,"" VDA President Matthias Wissmann said in a statement.German carmakers employ about 33,000 workers in the United States and German automotive suppliers about 77,000 more, the VDA said. Speaking in tabloid newspaper Bild, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that rather than trying to penalize German carmakers, the United States should instead respond by building better and more desirable cars.Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany's foreign affairs committee, said Berlin needed to take Trump's comments seriously. ""He seems to be absolutely focused on short-term job interests and security interests ... not that he is looking for free trade so much, but more for protection,"" he told Reuters.MEXICAN PLANSDaimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW already have sizeable factories in the United States where they build higher-margin sports utility vehicles (SUVs) for export to Asia and Europe.Around 65 percent of BMW's production from its factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is exported overseas. BMW builds the X3, X4, X5 and X6 models in the United States.""It is surprising that Trump singles out the carmaker that exports more vehicles from the United States than any other manufacturer,"" Evercore ISI analysts said.A BMW spokeswoman said the planned plant in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi would build the BMW 3 Series from 2019, with the output intended for the world market. The plant would be an addition to existing 3 Series production facilities in Germany and China.In June last year, BMW broke ground on the plant, pledging to invest $2.2 billion in Mexico by 2019 for annual production of 150,000 cars.Daimler has said it plans to begin assembling Mercedes-Benz vehicles in 2018 from a $1 billion facility shared with Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201) in Aguascalientes in Mexico. A spokesman for Daimler declined to comment on Trump's remarks. Last year, VW's Audi division inaugurated a $1.3 billion production facility with 150,000 vehicle production capacity near Puebla, Mexico. Audi said it would build electric and petrol Q5 SUVs in Mexico.Audi declined to comment on Monday. VW also declined to comment on Trump's remarks but noted it was investing another $900 million in its U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Trump called Germany a great car producer, saying Mercedes-Benz cars were a frequent sight in New York, but claimed there was not enough reciprocity. Germans were not buying Chevrolets at the same rate, he said, calling the business relationship an unfair one-way street. Chevrolet sales have fallen sharply in Europe since parent company General Motors (N:GM) in 2013 said it would drop the Chevrolet brand in Europe by the end of 2015. Since then, GM has focused instead on promoting its Opel and Vauxhall marques.Asked by Reuters whether Trump could take any steps to make it easier for GM to sell more American-made cars in Europe, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the company aimed to build cars in markets where they are sold.""We're a global company so we're going to continue that focus just because from an economic perspective that generally turns out to be the best framework,"" she said. ""I think there is a lot that we can work on with President-elect Trump.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

934,"Jan 13, 2017 11:05AM ET",Diesel emissions inquiries widen to Renault and Fiat,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume, Simon Carraud and Agnieszka Flak PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - European carmakers were drawn into a widening probe of diesel emissions testing on Friday, with French prosecutors examining  Renault  (PA:RENA) and British authorities seeking answers from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.Volkswagen's  admission that some of its diesel vehicles were fitted with software designed to hide their true level of emissions has highlighted that most cars spew out far higher levels of health-threatening nitrogen oxide (NOx) in everyday driving conditions than in laboratory tests. Shares in Renault fell more than 4 percent to their lowest level in around a month after a source at the Paris prosecutor's office said it had launched a judicial investigation into possible cheating on exhaust emissions at the French carmaker.Renault said it respected all laws concerning exhaust emissions, adding that its vehicles did not have software enabling them to cheat on emissions standards.The French clampdown follows allegations by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Thursday that Fiat Chrysler, like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), was potentially using illegal software to hide excess diesel emissions.No manufacturer other than VW has been found to have installed software designed solely for the purpose of circumventing emissions tests, but regulators in Britain and Germany say that carmakers have made extensive use of a ""thermal window"" which allows manufacturers to turn down pollution-control systems for the sake of protecting an engine. German investigators said they had found that some carmakers defined the ""thermal window"" in such a way that exhaust treatment systems were switched off most of the time. Switching off or throttling back emissions treatment systems in cold weather reduces the risk of condensation building up in catalytic converters, which may otherwise cause rust and reduce exhaust-filtering effectiveness in the long run.It also improves engine performance and stretches the intervals between refilling vehicles with urea, an expensive substance needed to extract NOx from exhaust fumes. Regulators across the globe are now seeking to determine when a ""thermal window"" engine management system becomes an illegal ""defeat device."" Under U.S. law, there is an obligation for manufacturers to declare their emission control strategy. This has been the basis for EPA action against Volkswagen and now against Fiat Chrysler.NEW TESTING REGIMEThe European Commission said it had been informed about the ""worrying"" EPA allegations and would look at what implications they might have for the European Union.""We will now work with the EPA, national member state authorities and of course Fiat in order to establish potential implications for vehicles sold in the EU,"" it said.The European Commission has limited powers to force polluting cars off European roads, since vehicle licensing in the EU is still conducted on a national level. But European regulators have introduced a more stringent testing regime designed to reflect everyday driving conditions in the wake of the VW scandal that will take effect this year.Under the revised Real Driving Emissions (RDE) cycle, the disparity between road and laboratory test results will be narrowed. SEEKING INFORMATIONBritain on Friday said it was urgently seeking information from the EPA over its allegation that Fiat Chrysler used hidden software to allow excess diesel emissions to go undetected.""We are urgently seeking further information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency... and will also be seeking information from the manufacturer regarding vehicles in the UK market,"" a spokesman at the Department for Transport said.Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne angrily rejected the allegations on Thursday, saying there was no wrongdoing and Fiat never attempted to cheat emissions rules with software detecting a vehicle was in test mode.Fiat's volatile shares surged 7 percent in Europe, after falling sharply in U.S. trading on Thursday, and were trading 5 percent higher at 1453 GMT.The automaker's stock has risen by around 70 percent this year since Donald Trump's election, on expectations of less stringent emissions policies under the next U.S. administration.But carmakers continue to face scrutiny in Europe. Earlier this week the European Commission called on Italy to cooperate with a German probe investigating allegations that the Fiat 500X, Fiat Doblo and Jeep Renegade models were equipped with illegal cheating software. Fiat rejects the allegations.Germany's motor vehicle authority KBA began testing the vehicles of several foreign manufacturers as part of a blanket probe of vehicle emissions after the Volkswagen scandal first came to light.And the country's transport ministry asked the European Commission to investigate Fiat's emissions after being stonewalled by Italian authorities.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

If you have two different visions then the result is that the work inside the team is slow,"" he added.Vasseur's departure came a day after champions Mercedes announced the exit of technical head Paddy Lowe, who is now expected to show up at Williams after a period of 'gardening leave'.For the first time in 23 years, Formula One will have no reigning world champion in action as a consequence of Nico Rosberg retiring five days after winning the title with Mercedes.The German's replacement has yet to be announced.McLaren had already parted company with their boss Ron Dennis, while engineering head Pat Symonds left Williams at the end of last year.Tail-enders Manor are meanwhile facing an uncertain future after going into administration this month.Renault, who took over failing Lotus at the end of 2015 and finished ninth of 11 teams last year, are due to unveil their new car on Feb. 21 with the season starting in Australia on March 26. The team, who have Germany's Nico Hulkenberg and Britain's Jolyon Palmer as drivers, started 2016 without a designated principal and will be run by president Jerome Stoll and managing director Cyril Abiteboul.Vasseur, who took on his role midway through last season, has a reputation for success in the GP2 support series with his ART team.Hulkenberg won the GP2 title with ART in 2009 and had been looking forward to linking up with Vasseur again after switching from Force India at the end of last season.There had for some time been reports of differences of opinion among the management despite Renault, who have restructured the team and recruited more staff, setting what looked like realistic targets.""We knew... when we took over the company that 2016 would be very difficult in terms of results. That's life. We have to build up a strong team for the future,"" Vasseur told Reuters a year ago.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

941,"Jan 05, 2017 12:20PM ET",Exclusive: Nissan halts joint development of luxury cars with Daimler - sources,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Nissan is halting joint development of luxury cars with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, sources close to the companies told Reuters, suspending a key project in their seven-year partnership and potentially hitting profitability at a new shared factory in Mexico.Nissan (T:7201) decided in October its premium Infiniti brand would not use ""MFA2"", an upgraded  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) car platform that the companies have jointly funded, in part because Infiniti was not performing well enough to absorb Mercedes technology costs, the sources said.""It wasn't possible to close a deal on the basis of MFA2,"" said one of the people. ""The targets set by Infiniti were too difficult to achieve.""The move could reduce efficiency at a $1 billion shared factory opening this year in Aguascalientes, Mexico, where the companies had planned to use the same compact car architecture to cut complexity and production costs, two of the sources said.It could also ultimately force Nissan to write down part of a 250 million pound ($306 million) investment at its UK plant that included Mercedes-based tooling, they added.Daimler and Nissan pursue joint programs only when ""beneficial for both sides"", the companies said in separate statements to Reuters, without directly addressing emailed questions about their plans for MFA2 vehicles.Projects are constantly reviewed against targets to account for ""developments beyond the control of management"", they added, and discussions about joint development of future premium compact cars are ongoing. Nissan's decision deals a blow to the broad cooperation deal struck between Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn and his Daimler counterpart Dieter Zetsche in 2010.It also underscores the mixed results of Nissan's battle over almost three decades to transform Infiniti into a significant global player in the lucrative luxury car market.The decision predates Donald Trump's election as the next U.S. president, the sources said, and was unrelated to campaign vows to penalize Mexican imports that have rattled the auto industry. Ford (N:F) on Tuesday scrapped a planned compact car plant in the country.Nissan and Daimler are pushing ahead with Aguascalientes, where they will build Infiniti and Mercedes models for the U.S. and other markets from a single assembly line opening in 2017.The project nonetheless faces weakening U.S. demand for smaller cars that contributed to Ford's cancellation and has further raised profitability hurdles for new Infiniti compacts.Persistently low oil prices accelerated the market shift to larger vehicles in 2016, Ford sales chief Mark LaNeve said on Wednesday. ""All the growth was SUVs and trucks.""PREMIUM STRUGGLEInfiniti has struggled outside the United States, last year selling 16,000 vehicles in Western Europe and 230,000 globally - less than 5 percent of Nissan's overall tally and barely one-tenth of Mercedes's expected 2 million deliveries.The first Infiniti appeared in 1989, the same year as the launch model for Toyota's (T:7203) upscale Lexus brand - which has since grown three times bigger by sales.Modern carmakers pursue economies of scale by increasing the number of models built on each underlying platform - an adaptable chassis accommodating different body sizes, engines and alternative component sets for every part of the vehicle.The retreat on luxury compacts leaves intact the sharing of engines between Infiniti and Mercedes, and small cars between  Renault  and Daimler's Smart. The three groups also collaborate on vans and pickups.But joint premium car development for Mexican production was ""one of the largest projects between the Renault-Nissan alliance and Daimler"", Ghosn said when unveiling the program in 2014.A year later, after upgrading its plant in Sunderland, England, Nissan began building the Infiniti Q30 hatchback on the current MFA architecture developed for the Mercedes A-Class and derivatives. The plant added the QX30 SUV in 2016, extending Infiniti's push into smaller vehicles.Nissan has now ditched plans to use the updated Mercedes platform for successors to those models planned for Aguascalientes, the sources said - or for any future Infinitis. Other cancellations include a compact Mercedes-based Infiniti Q40 sedan earmarked for the plant in 2018.Instead the single, less efficient assembly line will build Mercedes cars including an A-Class sedan and subsequent mini-SUV alongside Infiniti vehicles based on Renault-Nissan architecture, starting with a new QX50 SUV this year.PRICING POWERNissan was forced to conclude that the Infiniti brand would not command the higher prices required to turn a profit on vehicles stuffed with Mercedes technology, one source explained. ""One of the lessons learned is that if you have the costs of a luxury vehicle but not the pricing, it's hard to be profitable,"" he said.Nissan may end up writing down some Sunderland investment in Mercedes-based tooling that had been intended to outlast the current Q30 and QX30, people with knowledge of the matter said. The company is still paying its share of MFA2 development costs running to hundreds of millions of euros for a platform it no longer plans to use, they said, but will leave Daimler with a higher share of some production costs in Aguascalientes.The setback may also show the limits of Ghosn's consensual approach to economies of scale as head of both Renault (PA:RENA) and Nissan, whose 18-year-old alliance is underpinned by significant cross-shareholdings.The slow pace of integration has contributed to upheaval at the recently created alliance powertrain division, charged with converging Renault and Nissan engineering.Plans to build Infinitis on Mercedes technology had encountered resistance at Nissan from the start, one source said. ""Once again, Ghosn has been unable to break through the wall of engineers to force commonality.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

His departure from Williams means the former world champions, who finished fifth this year, will start the year with several new faces.Canadian Lance Stroll, still just 18, will be making his race debut but his team mate remains uncertain following the surprise retirement of Mercedes' newly-crowned world champion Nico Rosberg.Bottas, who has been at Williams since 2013, is the favorite to replace Rosberg as Lewis Hamilton's team mate. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff is also involved in the Finn's management.If Bottas leaves, Brazilian veteran Massa is tipped to come back out of the retirement he started -- somewhat reluctantly when it became evident there was nowhere else for him to go -- at the end of November.Media reports indicated Massa, 35, had agreed the terms for a return to Williams should Bottas go.Massa is currently on holiday, his manager Nicolas Todt was not immediately available and neither Williams nor Mercedes have confirmed anything.Williams use Mercedes engines and a discount on them, coupled with Lowe possibly being allowed to join the team earlier than scheduled, is likely to sweeten any deal for Bottas. Mercedes, who are believed to have former Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) technical head James Allison lined up, have said there will be no announcement on their driver line-up until the New Year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

944,"Dec 16, 2016 02:00AM ET",Nissan CEO sees record 2017 sales as global econ growth buoys demand,nan,"By Naomi TajitsuYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) will post record sales in 2017 as a stronger global economic growth buoys demand for the industry, offsetting the impact of volatile currency and commodity markets, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said. Ghosn, who is also CEO of alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA), said he was confident U.S. trade policy under President-elect Donald Trump would continue to promote strong ties with Mexico, where Nissan produces cars for export to the United States.There have been worries about the risk of rising costs for Nissan and its rival automakers if Trump makes good on promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or slap tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico.According to its latest global sales figures, Nissan sold 4.52 million over January to October, after posting record sales of 5.42 million cars and trucks worldwide in 2015.""I think 2017 should be a good year. I think we will see reasonable economic growth, particularly in the car industry ... I think we will establish a record for sales in 2017,"" Ghosn told reporters on Friday.Higher raw material prices and currency fluctuations will continue to present risks for the industry, but this will be offset by a growth trend in global economies that will keep demand for cars strong, Ghosn said.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects global growth to accelerate to 3.3 percent in 2017 from 2.9 percent this year as the Trump administration's planned tax cuts and public spending fire up the U.S. economy.Ghosn said he was not very worried about the future of the NAFTA. ""What has been said by the president of the United States is 'America first' ... We have to believe that the program is about American interest, and American interest includes strong trade relations with Mexico."" The international trend to reduce vehicle emissions will drive Nissan's plans to develop more ""green"" cars, including its Leaf - the world's top-selling all-battery powered car - regardless of industry moves to loosen regulations, Ghosn said.A U.S. trade group representing some of the world's largest automakers is making a last-ditch effort to block the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing tough fuel economy standards through the 2025 model year.Carmakers are scrambling to produce more lower-emission vehicles to comply with tightening regulations in China, the world's top auto market, California and other regions, even as a relatively high price and limited charging infrastructure has curbed consumer demand.After taking a controlling stake in the scandal-hit Mitsubishi Motors Corp earlier this year, Renault-Nissan will pool Mitsubishi plug-in gasoline hybrid technology and Nissan's battery-electric technology for use across models made by all three automakers, said Ghosn, also the chairman of Mitsubishi.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Compensation (excluding stock options) will not be doubled if we don't return to the black next year, for example. Because compensation will be merit-based, if our performance is not good, director salaries will reflect that,"" he said.Mitsubishi now has the firepower to raise compensation after paying its previous board of 10 directors 423 million yen in the year ended March, below the maximum 960 million yen previously set aside for such compensation.The company has yet to determine salary and benefits for Ghosn, and a breakdown of Wednesday's voting was not immediately available.As the head of the Renault-Nissan automaker alliance, Ghosn received combined compensation of around $17 million in 2015 despite a vote by Renault shareholders against his pay package of 7.2 million euros ($7.65 million) earlier this year.Executive pay is a major political issue in France, whose government commands more than 18 percent of voting rights in Renault. Ghosn last month told Reuters he expects the government to oppose his pay package in 2017.Ghosn is already among the top-paid executives in the auto industry, which also include General Motors (NYSE:GM) CEO Mary Barra, who received a combined $28.6 million in salary and perks last year, and Ford CEO Mark Fields, who was paid a total of $18.6 million.($1 = 115.1100 yen)($1 = 0.9407 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Representatives for the South Korean company could not immediately be reached for comment.Kia cars had been assembled by Pakistan in the past but disappointing sales led to a halt in manufacturing.The new venture will also market and sell, besides import and export of, ""all types of Kia vehicles, parts and accessories,"" Lucky Cement told the Pakistan Stock Exchange in a statement.Kia's re-entry into Pakistan will boost government efforts to shake up the Japanese-dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota (T:7203), Honda (T:7267) and Suzuki (T:7269), who assemble cars in Pakistan with local partners.Last month, French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) agreed to invest in a new factory in Pakistan and official say they are talking to several other carmakers.The government believes increased competition should bring down exceptionally high car prices in Pakistan, and in March it introduced a new auto policy favoring new entrants into the market by offering generous import duties.The incentives have angered existing market players, some of whom have said publicly they should get similar terms.Pakistan, with a population of nearly 200 million people, is a potentially huge market, but just 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year.

947,"Dec 06, 2016 10:54AM ET",Exclusive: Emissions crackdown exposes Renault-Nissan engine trouble,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan alliance is replacing its top executive in charge of combining the carmakers' engines and gearboxes, sources told Reuters, as tightening emissions regulations expose the slow pace of integration so far. Alain Raposo, global head of powertrain engineering, will be moved to an advisory role, and a successor announced this week, four people with knowledge of the matter said.A Renault-Nissan spokeswoman said there would be no comment on ""speculation about personnel changes"" from the companies or the people involved. ""The alliance is on track with its overall convergence objectives, including engineering,"" she said.Under Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who heads both  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan (T:7201), the carmaking alliance created in 1999 is still moving incrementally towards common vehicle architectures and engines, in search of 5.5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in annual savings by 2018.The two groups, with total sales of 145 billion euros, say 85 percent of engines are already shared in some way. But that understates inefficiencies, executives privately concede - as well as the cost of protracted bickering over whose technology becomes standard.""It's a permanent punch-up - after 17 years we are still unable to think like a single company,"" said one of Raposo's management colleagues. ""In powertrain it's always been hell.""A coming onslaught of emissions regulation in the wake of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) exposure last year for cheating U.S. diesel tests has made the problem more urgent.Independent studies have since blamed Renault for some of the highest real-world nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, piling pressure on engineering boss Gaspar Gascon Abellan and Thierry Bollore, Ghosn's second-in-command at the French carmaker.Questions over whether Renault's technology breaches EU law have been referred to prosecutors for investigation. Renault has said all its engines are legal.BEHIND SCHEDULEThe weak emissions performance is inflating Renault's bill for curbing excessive on-the-road emissions from current engines and accelerating development of cleaner new ones, along with rechargeable gasoline-electric hybrids.""We're behind on several projects - some engine development schedules are all over the place,"" said another manager. ""The tighter standards are causing real difficulties, so we're hiring and doing everything we can, but it's not enough.""In one example, Renault realized too late that the next generation of gasoline engines was likely to require particulate filters, hitherto reserved for diesels, the manager said. ""We had thought we could get by without them.""The scramble has begun to weigh on Renault's capital expenditure - focusing more attention on untapped savings opportunities with Nissan.Renault-Nissan is set to top 10 million annual vehicle sales following Nissan's acquisition of Mitsubishi Motors, rivalling the likes of Toyota (T:7203) and GM (N:GM). But the economies of scale are further behind.For instance, the carmakers have refused for years to pool three-cylinder gasoline engines, or to use each other's. The current Renault Clio and Nissan Micra have similarly powered - yet separately conceived - motors and transmissions.And while Nissan developed continuous variable transmission (CVT) automatic gearboxes through its subsidiary Jatco, Renault purchased costlier dual-clutch transmissions (DCT) from Getrag, pending plans to design and produce its own.LATE GAINSDuring Raposo's tenure, however, sources said Renault recently agreed to use a Nissan three-cylinder and shelve DCT gearbox development, in favor of greater use of its partner's CVT in core models, starting with the Kadjar SUV next year.Production of Nissan's next Micra, now ramping up at a Renault plant west of Paris, also includes versions with a Renault three-cylinder engine.But these gains are too little, too late to alleviate the strains on Renault's engineering resources. ""Top management wants to go faster,"" said another executive.Raposo is the latest in a series of alliance directors to pay the price for slow progress on technical convergence that they lack the authority to impose.Renault owns 43.4 percent of its larger partner but has refrained from exercising control under Ghosn's philosophy of consensual decision-making, which hands each company an effective veto on joint investments.The Renault and Nissan executive committees ""have never been capable of converging"" technologies in a timely way, a senior manager said. ""So they end up punishing the guy underneath.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Next year will be different.""Being able to put on some strength and muscle will be more challenging and more rewarding, so I'm up for that. I'm all for making it harder. Time to unlock the hidden Honey Badger,"" added Ricciardo, who has as a picture of the animal on the back of his racing helmet.The Australian, who won in Malaysia in October and started on pole in Monaco, shed more than three kilograms before the start of the 2016 season in a bid to improve performance.Former champions Red Bull were handicapped in 2015 by their uncompetitive  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine and sought other ways of closing the gap, one of them being reducing weight where possible.Ricciardo said third place in 2016 felt more convincing and more sustainable than it had in 2014.""This year I felt like I did everything I did in '14, but at a higher level when I really pushed myself,"" added the Australian, who had 19-year-old Dutch team mate Max Verstappen pushing him hard from May onwards. ""I was able to find some pretty good levels through the year, and there were quite a few times that I was able to exceed my own expectations for what I thought I could do, maybe even surprise myself a bit.""Otherwise, Ricciardo said he was looking to get home and relax once his team commitments were over.""It's little things that I get to experience again in the off-season that make me realize why I love being home when I can be.

The country's most recent Formula One race was at Magny-Cours, in central France, in 2008.France hosted the first recognized grand prix near Le Mans in 1906, and was also part of the first world championship season in 1950 with a race at Reims.The five-year deal was agreed with the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (PACA) region in association with the city of Toulon, department of Var and the French motorsport association (FFSA).PACA president Estrosi, an ex-mayor of Nice and a former car and motorcycle racer who finished fourth in the 1978 French 500cc Grand Prix at Nogaro, said the event was likely to happen in the European summer. He declined to say how much it had cost to bring back motor racing's elite competition, but said the contract was in the normal price range for a grand prix in Europe.""Losing the grand prix left a real scar on the country,"" Estrosi said.Germany has been axed from the 2017 calendar for financial reasons, despite the country having world champions in dominant Mercedes, but Hockenheim still has a contract to host the loss-making race in 2018.Le Castellet, which features the long Mistral straight, has been fully renovated and is now owned by Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone's family trust.The Briton told Reuters last week that the trust was not involved in the race and would be leasing the facility to ""the people that are going to be the promoters.""France currently has two drivers on the starting grid, Romain Grosjean and Esteban Ocon, while French manufacturer  Renault  (PA:RENA) has its own team and provides engines to former champions Red Bull and Toro Rosso.The showcase Monaco Grand Prix, a few hours' drive from Le Castellet, has been a fixture on the calendar since 1950 and the closest thing to a home race for French drivers in recent years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

957,"Nov 22, 2016 07:02AM ET",KKR to buy Nissan-backed supplier Calsonic for up to $4.5 billion,nan,"By Junko FujitaTOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm KKR & Co (N:KKR) is buying Nissan Motor-backed auto parts maker  Calsonic Kansei Corp  (T:7248) for up to 498.3 billion yen ($4.5 billion) in its biggest deal in Japan, seizing on a rare chance there to do a multi-billion dollar purchase.KKR announced on Tuesday it will pay 1,860 yen per Calsonic share, or a 28.3 percent premium over the stock's last closing price, for the 41 percent stake held by Nissan (T:7201) and for the rest of the shares from the market through a tender offer.It beat out rival private equity firms Bain Capital and MBK Partners, which, according to Thomson Reuters LPC, had bid to buy Nissan's stake. Japan's second-biggest automaker opened the auction to sell the stake in June.Calsonic provided private equity firms a rare opportunity to conduct a multi-billion dollar deal in a country where large companies are still reluctant to sell their units through drastic restructuring.Japan's private equity industry has been held back by decades of pitiful economic growth and a hostile corporate culture. But, encouraged by governance reforms and demographic shifts, the industry could see a flurry of activity.The KKR deal comes as Nissan is seeking to invest in areas such as development of new technologies, including in next generation electric cars and automated driving functions. Nissan also bought a controlling stake in embattled Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) earlier this year.Calsonic Kansei, which specializes in traditional auto parts, including interiors, electronics, air conditioning units and compressors, relies for about 80 percent of its global sales on Nissan.KKR said it would help Calsonic expand internationally amid a shrinking home market for the Japanese company. ""As a partner to Calsonic Kansei's management team, we aim to assist the company in achieving its growth ambitions and make available our international network and industry expertise to continue Calsonic Kansei's success globally,"" Hiro Hirano, head of KKR Japan, said in a statement. The company expects the tender offer to be launched in February 2017.EXCESSIVE RELIANCESome private equity firms that did not bid to buy Calsonic had concerns about its excessive reliance on Nissan for revenue, and limited growth potential for the auto parts it makes, according to sources. But as more Japanese automakers dismantle their supplier groups, Calsonic has been trying to grow its client baseaway from Nissan. It now counts  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) - which owns 44 percent of Nissan - Isuzu Motors and other automakers as clients.In Japan, KKR has done some sizeable deals. These include the 2013 purchase of Panasonic Healthcare from Panasonic Corp (T:6752) in a deal worth $1.67 billion and the acquisition of Pioneer DJ from Pioneer Corp (T:6773) in 2014 for $550 million.And KKR agreed to sell Intelligence Holdings for 68 billion yen in 2013, almost double what it initially paid for the temporary staffing agency three years ago.The U.S. buyout firm had also been interested in buying Takata Corp (T:7312), the Japanese parts maker at the center of the world's biggest auto recall, but the buyout firm was no longer in the bidding, sources told Reuters earlier this month.Calsonic shares were untraded earlier on Tuesday after the company said it would discuss Nissan's stake sale at its board meeting. The shares closed at 1,450 yen, up 9.7 percent.Nissan shares closed down 1.4 percent.KKR was advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co on the Calsonic deal, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) advised Nissan.

958,"Nov 18, 2016 10:14AM ET","Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs",nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan SchwartzWOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and its labor unions agreed to cut 30,000 jobs at the core VW brand in exchange for a commitment to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025, a compromise which leaves the carmaker's profitability still lagging rivals.The turnaround plan announced on Friday will lead to 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and lift the Volkswagen (VW) brand's operating margin to 4 percent that year, from an expected 2 percent in 2016.That target still remains below rival European carmakers such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), which is targeting an operating margin of 6 percent in 2021.VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements.The cuts came with a management pledge to create 9,000 new jobs in the area of battery production and mobility services at factories in Germany as part of efforts to shift toward electric and self-driving cars.""We have to invest billions of euros in new cars and services while new rivals will attack us - the transformation will surely be more radical than everything we have experienced to date,"" VW brand CEO Herbert Diess said at a press conference.DEEP ENOUGH?Some experts argued the cost cuts were not deep enough.Spending on R&D and staff across VW's automotive operations has been growing for years with the need to overhaul the cost base dating back to before the diesel emissions scandal broke 14 months ago.""The deal may be the best the company could negotiate with labor but it's not a victory for either side,"" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor.""The cuts are too small to make VW cost competitive with Toyota (T:7203) and other global rivals.""With 610,000 workers globally, VW last year built slightly fewer vehicles than Toyota which has 350,000 staff. The German company has also been slow to cease production of unprofitable vehicles in its 340-model range.VW's labor leaders said management had agreed to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025, a step which clears the way to cutting 23,000 jobs via the more palatable methods of buyouts, early retirements and reducing part-time staff.Jobs will also be cut in North America, Brazil and Argentina, VW said, without being more specific. Around 120,000 employees work for VW brand in Germany including 6,000 temporary staff.UNIONS PLEASEDMany analysts and investors nonetheless welcomed the deal, sending the shares more than 2 percent higher to the top of the blue-chip DAX (GDAXI) index in early Frankfurt trading. At 1324 GMT (8:24 a.m. ET), the stock was still trading up 0.8 percent at 118.5 euros.Activist hedge fund TCI, which has been critical of Volkswagen management, said it looked like a good deal all round provided it could be made to stick.""As long as they are net savings – the savings are not given back by increased costs elsewhere in the organization,"" said TCI partner Ben Walker.""They've just to deliver now. It's easy to talk. They now have to deliver and execute,"" he added. Labor leaders were pleased with the outcome.""The most important message is the jobs of the core workforce is secure,"" VW's works council chief Bernd Osterloh said at the news conference in Wolfsburg, where the company has its headquarters.Management and labor agreed to outsource production of plastic parts from the German Braunschweig plant but will compensate workers by assigning more orders for chassis and steering assembly needed with rising investment in self-drive cars.In a further sign of its shifting focus, VW said it will build electric cars at its German factories in Zwickau and Wolfsburg. Electric motors will be built in Kassel, and VW will start battery cell production and development in Salzgitter. Volkswagen will also build battery packs for electric and hybrid cars in Braunschweig, it said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

959,"Nov 18, 2016 09:30AM ET",Exclusive: Renault boss sees pay row with French government in election year,nan,"By Joseph White and Laurence FrostNEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expects the French government to oppose his pay package in 2017, he told Reuters in an interview, setting the stage for another shareholder meeting clash - this time in an election year.""I don't think there's any chance that they will approve"" Renault's pay proposals, Ghosn said of the likely government position. The economy and finance ministry declined to comment.Ghosn nonetheless hopes to avoid a repeat of the last annual meeting outcome in April, when investors with 54 percent of voting rights opposed his 7.2 million euro ($7.6 million) pay. ""Our objective is to have a majority vote,"" he said.The French state owns 19.7 percent of Renault. Under a complex deal struck last year, its voting rights on routine questions including compensation are capped between 17.9 percent and 20 percent, depending on meeting attendance.Executive pay is attracting tougher shareholder scrutiny at companies from HSBC (L:HSBA) to  BP  (L:BP) and has become a hot political issue in France, where campaigning is well underway for presidential and legislative elections next April-June.The French parliament last week passed a law granting shareholders a binding vote on CEO pay structures, starting next year, and on actual payouts from 2018. Until now, French ""say on pay"" votes have lacked legal force. After the April 29 shareholder vote, Renault's board reconvened hastily and decided to uphold Ghosn's 2015 package, while pledging a review of future pay policy.The immediacy of its response intensified French criticism of Ghosn, who draws a second salary as CEO of alliance partner Nissan (T:7201), 44.5 percent-owned by the French carmaker.His 15.6 million euros in combined Renault-Nissan pay last year amounted to the third-biggest haul among CEOs of France's blue-chip CAC 40 index, according to advisory firm Proxinvest, which counsels funds on how to vote their shares.The firm wants to set a ""socially acceptable maximum"" for executive pay at 240 times the French minimum wage, or 4.8 million euros at today's rates.Renault's review culminated in July with a 20 percent cut to the variable component of Ghosn's 2016 pay packet.The reduction, worth 369,000 euros at last year's levels, is unlikely to satisfy the French government. ""We'll need to discuss this again (but) the new board proposals don't yet look sufficient,"" a ministry source said.Several people familiar with the matter said Renault's announcement was preceded by weeks of talks with investors who had opposed Ghosn's package or voiced concerns, including asset manager Amundi and Norwegian sovereign fund Norges.The consultations make it more likely Renault's revised pay policy will command at least narrow majority support at the next shareholder meeting despite state opposition, some said.France's political calendar nonetheless adds a degree of unpredictability and more scope for corporate embarrassment.Renault has yet to set a date for the 2017 meeting. Unless substantially delayed, however, it is likely to fall within an election season that begins with the first-round presidential vote on April 23 and ends with legislatives on June 18.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But it has big ambitions, aiming to achieve a market share of at least 90 percent by the end of 2018, Daiber said.""We're already in a good position in many markets,"" he added, pointing to Germany and Austria.

962,"Nov 16, 2016 11:40AM ET","Exclusive: VW seeks cost-cutting deal by Friday, devil is in the detail",nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is pushing for a cost-cutting deal with workers at its core brand by Friday to help fund investment in electric and self-drive cars, but accounts of discussions in just one area show how difficult it is.The need for a turnaround plan at the VW brand has been amplified by the billions of costs it is facing for its diesel emissions scandal but union leaders do not want workers to carry the can for what they see as the mistakes of managers.The main sticking point of the talks is how to ensure the future of its German factories as it seeks to cut some traditional roles making combustion engines in favor of new positions producing batteries and electric engines.Neither VW nor its powerful labor unions would comment on the progress of the talks but details from three company sources of discussions over the assembly of plastic parts shed light on their complexity.VW brand chief Herbert Diess, a former executive at BMW (DE:BMWG), which is less vertically integrated than VW, has sought to end production of some plastic parts including fuel tanks and bumpers at the Wolfsburg base, the three sources said.In a sign of the scale of the challenge, a new 1,500-square meter hall with blow-molding technology to make more plastic tanks went on stream only in September, the sources said.Unions have so far blocked Diess's plan, which would involve cutting several hundred of the 3,000 jobs involved in making plastic parts, an area competitors have long since outsourced.Management and labor are also discussing the outsourcing of some production of plastic parts at Braunschweig near Wolfsburg, one of the sources said. Those talks involve compensating staff by assigning more orders for chassis and steering assembly which will become more relevant with self-driving cars.Two VW factories in particular are hoping to benefit from the post-dieselgate expansion into zero-emission technology: Salzgitter, which now makes combustion engines and Kassel, VW’s biggest component plant making gearboxes, engines and emission systems.One company source indicated an overarching deal could be reached by Friday, but others did not confirm the prediction.BOARD MEETINGThe supervisory board of VW, part owned by the state of Lower Saxony and Qatari Investment Authority, is due to meet on Friday to approve spending on plants, equipment and models across the multi-brand group until the end of the decade, but needs prior agreement with the works council on restructuring and jobs.Managers want to cut annual costs at the core brand by 3.7 billion euros ($3.99 billion) through 2021 to help fund VW's transformation while facing billions of euros in costs from its emissions scandal.But labor leaders, who occupy almost half the seats on the group's 20 member supervisory board, have said they will not approve any cutbacks without management committing to fixed targets and quotas for product, output and investment.That could have an impact on the share price.""They urgently need to bring about change and not settle for a shaky compromise,"" said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper who last week lowered his recommendation on the stock to ""Hold"" from ""Buy"" because of the reported discovery of cheat software at luxury brand Audi.Toyota (T:7203) built slightly more vehicles than VW last year with 40 percent fewer workers, the Center of Automotive Research said. First-half earnings per car were 395 euros at VW brand, 715 euros at  Renault  (PA:RENA) and 844 euros at PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP).Pieper argued that the group should be able to shed a third of its global 610,000-workforce and shut about 10 of its 120 plants. VW has ruled out forced layoffs but may cut up to 25,000 staff by waiting for people to retire.Sources have said it plans to double this year's expected operating of 2 percent by 2020 and lift it to 6 percent by 2025. That is below current profitability benchmarks at rivals Ford (N:F), PSA and Toyota.Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst who has a ""Buy"" recommendation on VW, said that may not last. ""It goes without saying that a 4 percent target by 2020 would jeopardize what we believe could be a credible turnaround story,"" he said.          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We got through all of our run programs and the car is feeling really good,"" Hamilton, who is seeking his third win in a row, told reporters.""It's pretty tough out here physically right now with the heat as high as it is...finding the right balance isn't easy either in these conditions as the tyres are getting really hot.""Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen was second in the morning but sixth after lunch, when the Williams pair of Valtteri Bottas and home favorite Felipe Massa were Mercedes' closest rivals.Rosberg, who described his day as a ""pretty normal Friday"", can clinch his first championship title if he wins on Sunday, wherever Hamilton finishes.""Our car looks quick but Red Bull are definitely close. The soft tyre is degrading quite a lot on the long runs, with blistering on the rears,"" the German said.""There's a surprising amount of degradation on the medium tyre too - but I think overall we've got decent pace on the long runs.""On paper Rosberg has a good chance, having won the last two Brazilian Grands Prix from pole position, but Hamilton - wearing an Ayrton Senna themed helmet this weekend - has the momentum after victories in Texas and Mexico.The weather at Interlagos can change from sunshine to torrential rain in a matter of minutes and the race has a history of surprises and drama, meaning there is still everything to play for.Australian Daniel Ricciardo was fourth and fifth fastest for Red Bull who have improved steadily this season and are the only team other than Mercedes to have won races.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was ninth in the morning, on the slower medium tyres, after spinning off in the closing minutes - his comments over the radio swiftly bleeped out on the television feed.The German, seventh in the second session, was warned after an expletive-laden outburst at the previous race in Mexico.Russian reserve Sergey Sirotkin took Kevin Magnussen's place at  Renault  (PA:RENA) for the morning stint while Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc was given a practice run in Mexican Esteban Gutierrez's Haas.McLaren's Fernando Alonso provided some laughs when his McLaren suffered an energy recovery problem and stopped trackside.The Spaniard also broke down in practice at Interlagos last year, when he triggered a social media flurry by sitting on a marshal's folding chair and sunning himself with his feet resting on his helmet.This time he again cast around for something to sit on, and found a television operator who offered him his place at the controls of the camera.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We shouldn't allow it to happen,"" he said.German automakers are heavily exposed to any new trade restrictions with Mexico.""Rhetoric around Mexican production, trade tariffs and a potential step-back in consumer confidence will likely weigh on stocks and auto demand,"" brokerage Evercore ISI said in a note on Wednesday.VW shares were down 2.3 percent at 1426 GMT, with BMW 1.9 percent lower and Daimler down 1.8 percent, outpacing a 1.4 percent dip for the broader European auto sector.BMW broke ground in June on a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, pledging to invest $2.2 billion by 2019 for annual production of 150,000 cars.Three months later, VW's Audi division inaugurated a $1.3 billion facility of the same capacity near Puebla. Audi will build electric and petrol Q5 SUVs in Mexico.By 2020, Mexico will have the plant capacity to supply a quarter of all vehicles sold in the United States, according to consulting firm IHS Automotive, up from one in six in 2012.Daimler also plans to begin assembling Mercedes-Benz vehicles in 2018 from a $1 billion facility shared with Renault-Nissan.The company employs 22,000 workers in the United States and aims to ""build a constructive dialogue with the new administration"", a Daimler spokesman said.European carmakers and other businesses had also been hoping a victory for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would clear remaining obstacles to large-scale investments in Iran, 16 months after a breakthrough deal to curb its nuclear program.Financial institutions are still too wary of U.S. sanctions to bankroll new deals, bankers have said, with the prospect of a Trump victory adding to their concerns.But Renault and PSA, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, have already begun ramping up investments and production in a market once dominated by the French.PSA, which has announced two manufacturing ventures with local partners, relies on Iran for 15 percent of its global car sales, while Renault unveiled its own production investment in September. Both groups declined to comment on Wednesday.Weeks before the election, however, PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares expressed hope that Trump's words on scrapping the Iranian nuclear deal would never translate into action.""There can be quite a gap between what's said on the campaign trail and what is done after the election,"" Tavares said at the Paris auto show, adding Iran presented a ""major opportunity"" for the group.""It's an opportunity we are not going to pass up, especially since our presence is 100 percent compliant with international rules,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

With financial difficulties leading to a lack of pre-season testing and car development, 2016 has been one big blank for Nasr and Swedish team mate Marcus Ericsson (ST:ERICAs).Sauber, who have been in Formula One since 1993, have been last in the constructors' standings since Germany's Pascal Wehrlein finished 10th in Austria in July but Interlagos could change that.""In terms of getting a point, in Sao Paulo as we know there is always a question mark on the weather, it can be anything – sunny or rainy on the same day,"" Nasr told Reuters in a telephone interview from Miami.""And this could play into our hands, in terms of having tricky conditions out there or if the track is wet or dry enough.""I would expect something like this that would help us score points because in normal conditions, on pure performance, we don’t have the car to achieve a top 10 finish. ""We need this combination and lets count on home soil too to bring us luck. It’s better to be positive than not,"" he added.Next week will be Nasr's second home race, after a promising debut season in 2015, and this time he heads for Brazil with time pressing literally and figuratively.Busy promoting a limited edition Felipe Nasr watch, made by Miami-based apparel and design brand Felio Siby and with an eye-popping price tag of $135,000, he is also assessing his options and waiting for a deal to come together.FLIP SIDEWith compatriot Felipe Massa retiring, Nasr stands to be South America's sole F1 driver next season.Commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone is keen on ensuring he stays but where remains to be seen, with speculation linking him to vacant seats at Force India and  Renault  (PA:RENA) -- for whom Brazil is an important market -- as well as Sauber.""There is nothing 100 percent yet but I am pretty confident we are going to be there (in Formula One) next year,"" said Nasr.His watch sponsor, founded by Gabon-born Dominique Siby, is also Force India's official lifestyle partner but the driver ruled out any significance of that deal in relation to his future.""Everybody wants to know where (I'll be). Even me, I don’t know where yet. But hopefully soon we are going to know,"" he added.Sauber will have 2016 specification Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) engines next year, which will put them at a power disadvantage but save money, and Nasr supported that step because more could be spent on improving the chassis.""There are better possibilities for results in other places, but Sauber -- knowing the team and I’ve been there for two years now so you build a relationship -- it’s much easier to know how to work with them,"" he said.On the downside, it would take time to get back up to speed.""As a driver you’re always thinking about how can I get the best results for myself. There’s many other things that come together, being at the right place at the right time, so we are working on it,"" he said.""In that first year I was able to show what I came for. This year since has been a little bit more difficult ... I saw the two sides of the coin, put it that way.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

975,"Nov 03, 2016 12:10PM ET",Renault-Nissan's Ghosn says mini-hybrids could compete in Europe,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan's new gasoline-electric hybrid technology would be competitive in Europe, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on Thursday, as carmakers turn away from diesel for smaller vehicles The ""e-Power"" transmission, announced a day earlier by Renault's alliance partner Nissan for the Note subcompact car in Japan, amounts to an electric vehicle powered by a small gasoline generator instead of a large battery.Carmakers are racing into electrification as Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) emissions test-cheating scandal hastens diesel's decline and stiffens regulatory resolve.  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Toyota are among those signaling a faster retreat from diesel in small cars.Although not emissions-free, e-Power's smaller battery makes it significantly cheaper than electric-only cars and never needs recharging. Fuel economy figures suggest that the carbon dioxide output compares well with traditional hybrid minis such as the Toyota Yaris. ""It's definitely cost-competitive with diesel,"" Ghosn said on Thursday, adding that the new technology ""absolutely"" would be viable for the European mass-market. Ghosn, who heads both carmakers, was speaking to Reuters at the New York Times Energy for Tomorrow conference in Paris.A Nissan spokeswoman said: ""There are no current plans for e-Power in Europe. But the technology can be adapted to other markets and (vehicle categories), so we wouldn't rule it out.""Renault-Nissan is not alone in using combustion engine generators to power electric cars.They have featured aboard Chevrolet's 2011 Volt electric car and as a range-extending option for BMW's i3. PSA, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS vehicles, is building electric prototypes with single-cylinder generators from Israeli start-up Aquarius Engines.Nissan said that Japanese prices for its e-Power Note will start at 1.77 million yen ($17,140), a 27 percent premium over the basic gasoline version. That is comparable with the extra outlay for a diesel option in European cars such as the VW Polo.The e-Power Note's stated fuel economy of 37.2 km per liter, based on Japanese regulatory test standards, suggests CO2 emissions of about 62 grammes/km. Toyota's Yaris hybrid emits 75 g/km in European testing.Renault-Nissan aims to market a battery-only vehicle in China for as little as $7,000 to $8,000 after government incentives, Ghosn also said on Thursday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

977,"Nov 01, 2016 01:59PM ET",Frustrated Europe hopes Clinton win can spur elusive Iran deals,nan,"By Noah Barkin BERLIN (Reuters) - After a year of disappointment, European businesses are hoping a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large-scale Western investments in Iran since the opening of its economy.While no one in Europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should Clinton defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump on Nov. 8, a win for the Democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last year's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.Business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the Iranian market in 2017, especially in the second half of the year, if a Clinton victory is followed by the re-election of moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next May.""If Clinton and Rouhani win, then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now,"" said Matthieu Etourneau, who advises French firms on the Iranian market for MEDEF International, the French employers group.""This is what the European banks and companies are waiting for,"" he said.Back in January, when the United States and Europe lifted sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, the excitement in Europe's business community was palpable.With a population of 78 million and annual output higher than that of Thailand, Iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union.European politicians flocked to Tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a platform to reduce Iran's isolation, traveled to Paris and Rome to promote his country to eager investors.But within months the euphoria had vanished, replaced by frustration on both sides.BIGGEST OBSTACLEThe biggest obstacle for European firms seeking to do business in Iran has been the reluctance of the continent's largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line.The United States has taken steps to reassure the banks. Last month the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing U.S. dollar transactions with Iran.But Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged at a think-tank event in London this week that banks remained skittish. German officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried.This caution is likely to persist, regardless of who is sitting in the White House. Beyond the issue of sanctions, the poor state of Iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system, the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners.""Everyone knows now that this will be a long, step-by-step process to build up our economic ties,"" said Friedolin Strack, head of international markets at the Federation of German Industries (BDI).Still, a Clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to Europe. Her close adviser Jake Sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in Oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear activity, and she has defended it during the election campaign.Trump, by contrast, has called it ""one of the worst deals ever made"" and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected. Bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a Trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in Europe.Recently however, there have been signs of movement.Smaller German banks, pressed by their clients to support them in Iran, are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services.""Medium-sized banks that finance the German Mittelstand have a great deal of interest in Iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively,"" said Siegfried Utzig, acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the Association of German Banks (BvB). ""We can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's still quite far away.""ENORMOUS POTENTIALIn June, the German government began offering export credit guarantees via insurance group Euler Hermes for firms wanting to trade with Iran.Edna Schoene, head of German government business at Euler Hermes, said about 30 formal applications had been received since then with a total value of about 2.5 billion euros. Nine of them have been approved.Add to that roughly 70 non-binding letters of interest (LOIs) that have been issued and the volumes push up into the double-digit billions of euros, Schoene said.""The potential in Iran is enormous and the demand for export credit guarantees is high, both in terms of formal applications and expressions of interest,"" Schoene said. ""I expect that we will see the first large-scale, credit-financed deals in 2017.""Some European firms are already benefiting from the opening of the Iranian economy. Last week French carmaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP), once the market leader, announced it had produced 105,000 cars in Iran under the  Peugeot  license in the third quarter, 15 percent of its total sales volume.Etourneau of MEDEF International is also optimistic that Iran's order of 118 jets from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and a recent joint venture deal between carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Iranian investment fund IDRO will prove a boon for smaller European suppliers. MEDEF International announced last month it was opening an office in Tehran, its first outside France, to support small and medium sized French firms seeking to enter the Iranian market.""We expect that 20-30 billion euros in public contracts to be attributed by the Iranians before the end of their fiscal year in March,"" Etourneau said. ""What we are telling companies is that they need a 5-10 year strategy. The market will open up progressively.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A source at Audi said the move would save Audi nearly 100 million euros per year.VW's flagship luxury division has set aside more than half a billion euros to cover costs for the diesel emissions scandal and possible recalls of cars fitted with Takata Corp airbags. Third-quarter financial results are due on Friday.Le Mans, one of the greatest tests of endurance for cars and drivers, has been a source of prestige for Audi which has won the race 13 times in 18 years.The decision to exit the WEC means Audi will be left with no diesel engines in motorsports, a spokesman said.It also leaves the WEC with just two manufacturers competing for the championship: Audi's VW stablemate  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), which has won for the past two years with hybrid models, and Toyota.Toyota said in a statement that it noted Audi's decision ""with regret"" but it would have no effect on the company's plans.""We are preparing for 2017 when we will return with the target of winning the Le Mans 24 Hours and the World Championship,"" a spokesman for the Japanese company said. A Porsche spokesman said it also had no plans to quit.More than a year after VW admitted to rigging emissions tests, Audi's move is another setback for diesel which analysts have said faces higher costs amid tougher standards and testing methods.But Audi said its exit from top-level sportscar racing does not imply diesel technology will disappear in its road cars.""If we are serious about achieving carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets, then there is no alternative to diesel because they are the most efficient engines,"" the spokesman said.Audi will continue to compete in Germany's DTM touring car championship where it will switch from an 8-cylinder to a 4-cylinder petrol-drive car in 2018.Separately, Audi is looking at the possibility of expanding its engagement in the RX World Rallycross championship where it may replace its 4-cylinder petrol model with an electric model, a spokesman said.Audi's decision is also a boost for Formula E, which has attracted interest from other manufacturers including German rivals BMW and Mercedes as well as  Renault  (PA:RENA), Jaguar, Citroen and India's Mahindra.""I was as surprised as anyone, probably,"" Formula E Chief Executive Alejandro Agag told Reuters.

The car was involved in over 4,000 deaths in Mexico between 2007 and 2012, safety organization NCAP said earlier this year. Nissan's announcement coincided with a new NCAP report that gave the version of the Tsuru sold with no airbags a zero star safety rating.The Global NCAP and the Inter-American Development Bank safety report published on Wednesday concluded that more than 440,000 deaths and serious injuries could be prevented and up to $143 billion saved if basic U.N. vehicle regulations were applied in major Latin American countries.Nissan said it will cease production in Mexico by May 2017 but will continue to support Tsuru customers by offering service, parts for repairs and maintenance of vehicles for the foreseeable future.The Japanese company said overall production volume in Mexico would not be affected by the move because it was increasing output of other models at two plants in the central state of Aguascalientes.A new  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and  Renault  (PA:RENA)-Nissan alliance joint-venture manufacturing complex will start production in Aguascalientes in late 2017, the company said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The works council did not return calls seeking comment. Talks between brand management and labour leaders are faltering at the moment with investment pledges and cost savings proving stumbling blocks, the sources said.Raising the pressure on management ahead of a staff gathering at the company's Wolfsburg headquarters on Thursday, labour bosses warned that the pact -- viewed by analysts as key to VW's longer-term future -- could still fail if executives withhold commitments to fixed targets and quotas for products, output and investment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Mitsubishi will not become a subsidiary of Nissan,"" he told a joint briefing.""This sends a strong message that it's not Nissan that's going to transform Mitsubishi, it's Mitsubishi that's going to transform Mitsubishi.""Pooling resources and eliminating duplicate operations would result in estimated annual cost savings of 25 billion yen for Mitsubishi while lifting its profit margins by more than 2 percentage points as of 2019.The company said it would also boost its earnings per share by 12 yen next year and 20 yen in 2018.SCANDAL RECOVERYNissan had first announced in May its intention to take a controlling stake in Mitsubishi after Mitsubishi admitted to falsifying the mileage of four minivehicle models, including two made for Nissan.Mitsubishi Motors blamed poor communication, lax governance and internal pressure for its lack of compliance after it was found in August to have overstated the mileage of eight additional models.As Nissan becomes the dominant stake holder in Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi's group companies - trading house Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd [MTFGTU.UL] - will see their combined stake diluted to around 17 percent, from about 34 percent before the deal was announced.Nissan has said it will not sell its stake to a non-group company without Mitsubishi Motors' consent for 10 years."

988,"Oct 18, 2016 12:50PM ET","Foreign firms say UK profits hit by Brexit vote, weak sterling",nan,"By Tom BerginLONDON (Reuters) - The drop in sterling and some weakening in demand following the vote to leave the European Union have eaten into the earnings of foreign firms operating in Britain, companies have been saying as they reveal their third quarter results this month.Firms including carmaker Ford, technology group HP Inc, Ryanair and Delta Air Lines Inc, said Britain’s vote to leave the EU, or Brexit, was forcing them to reassess profit targets, plan additional cost cuts, increase prices in Britain and curtail operations.Large listed firms are beginning to report profits for the July to September period -- the first full quarter’s earnings since Britain’s June 23 referendum on EU membership, which sent the value of sterling to a record low against a basket of currencies.While many domestic-focused British companies have reported resilient earnings since the Brexit vote, foreign companies are suffering because the profits they make in the UK are now worth much less in dollars or euros.“Translating sterling back into their own currency is a negative,” said Ian Williams, Economist & Strategist at Peel Hunt stockbrokers in London.He added that if companies believed the drop would persist, it could prompt them to freeze or cut investments in Britain: “The question is whether they want to maintain the degree of exposure to the UK that they have done historically.""India’s Tata Consulting, which offers outsourcing services to UK companies, told investors last week that earnings were suffering after a drop in the value of the pound from 95 to 81 rupees.Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) said it revised its estimate of currency impacts to reflect the weaker pound and U.S. Toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS), which manufactures Disney character dolls, told investors on Monday it faced a $25 million hit from currency headwinds -- primarily due to the UK pound -- in the fourth quarter. Irish budget airline Ryanair (I:RYA) cut its forecast for its profit growth this year to 7 percent from 12 percent on Tuesday citing the weaker pound.EXPORTERS HIT TOOThe weak pound has been celebrated as a boon for exporters, whose sterling-based costs are reduced relative to their foreign-currency revenues. But even foreign companies with export-orientated manufacturing operations in the UK have been hit. Carmaker Ford which has engine-making plants in Dagenham and Bridgend said last month that currency and GDP weakness following Brexit would weigh on European earnings.“Brexit we think in the short term, [will hit Ford’s margins by] a couple hundred million dollars this year,” Jim Farley vice president for Europe, Middle East & Africa said at an investor presentation.“We think it's going to be more like $600 million next year,” he added.Many foreign companies echoed comments from UK businesses which said they saw no major fall-off in demand from consumers post-Brexit. Yet some foreign companies selling to other businesses said they felt customers were now more hesitant to make big ticket purchases.“There is a sense of anxiety and that is still obviously continuing,” Vishal Sikka, CEO of outsourcing group  Infosys  Ltd. (NS:INFY) said on an investor call. Tata said it also saw weaker growth than it had expected before Brexit.PRICING POWERMany foreign companies said they aimed to offset the lower value of sterling by charging their customers more. Peel Hunt’s Williams said the biggest Brexit losers would be those companies without the power to push through price increases.Luxury goods maker LVMH said it had increased UK prices by 5 percent twice this year, without any drop in demand. Ford (N:F) said it had increased prices by 1.3 percent, helped by the fact that rivals Peugeot and  Renault  (PA:RENA) had done likewise. But even then, Ford said it only expects “some of that Brexit headwind” to be offset by this. Companies said they were also responding by intensified cost-cutting.“Given the continued headwinds due to competition, foreign currency and market sizing, we are driving another set of productivity improvements in fiscal 2017,” Cathie Lesjak HP Inc’s chief financial officer told investors last week.A few are scaling back operations. Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said it was cutting capacity on Transatlantic routes.But for now, companies downplayed any imminent plans to slash UK investment and relocate plants or people to other countries. Most said they were waiting to see the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU and what kind of access to the single market the UK will enjoy in future.“We've developed plans based upon various scenarios and we are going to have to wait and see how everything unfolds to know what we are going to do,” Paul Donofrio, chief financial officer of Bank of America, (N:BAC) said on Monday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

F1’s new regulations will change the game and give our team a good opportunity,"" the 2015 Le Mans winner said in a statement on Friday. ""In the years to come, Renault will play a challenger role, which fits my approach to racing 100 percent.""Mercedes-powered Force India are fourth in the championship, ahead of Williams, and Hulkenberg's departure will leave a coveted vacancy.Renault, who bought the failing Lotus team at the end of last year, are struggling in ninth place but - as former champions with strong resources - can be expected to become far more competitive.Their engine has powered Red Bull to two victories this season.""This season has been about putting the foundations in place for future success,"" said Renault Sport racing chairman Jerome Stoll.""For our next step we required an experienced driver who is still hungry for podiums. Nico Hulkenberg fulfils this role perfectly and is an excellent complement to what we want to achieve.""Hulkenberg, 29, has yet to finish on the podium in seven seasons that include one with Williams and one with Sauber but he hoped that would change at a team with a great lineage.""In his stint with Renault, Michael Schumacher not only helped make Germany an F1 nation, he also sparked my enthusiasm and fire for racing,"" he said.""As a part of the Renault family, I want to develop the car and write new success stories.""Seven-times champion Schumacher won his second title in 1995 with Renault-powered Benetton, the team now renamed Renault and still based at Enstone in central England.Force India, who have Mexican Sergio Perez confirmed for 2017, thanked Hulkenberg for his contribution over five seasons.""He's an outstanding driver, who has scored more points for this team than anybody else,"" said team principal Vijay Mallya.""While it's true we will miss Nico, we respect his decision to explore fresh opportunities and it would be wrong to stand in his way.""Hulkenberg's arrival means either, or maybe both, Denmark's Kevin Magnussen and Britain's Jolyon Palmer will depart next season, when the sport undergoes a major rule change with wider tyres and faster cars.Palmer was signed by Lotus while Magnussen was a late arrival following the departure of Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado in February.Of the two, Magnussen looks more likely to stay but the paddock rumor-mill has pointed to French rookie Esteban Ocon, currently with Manor, as a possible Renault or Force India driver.Ocon's current team mate Pascal Wehrlein, the Mercedes reserve driver, has also been tipped for a move to Force India.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

990,"Oct 14, 2016 08:27AM ET",Exclusive: Carmakers forced back to bigger engines in new emissions era,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Agnieszka Flak PARIS (Reuters) - Tougher European car emissions tests being introduced in the wake of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) scandal are about to bring surprising consequences: bigger engines.Carmakers that have spent a decade shrinking engine capacities to meet emissions goals are now being forced into a costly U-turn, industry sources said, as more realistic on-the-road testing exposes deep flaws in their smallest motors. Renault  (PA:RENA), General Motors (N:GM) and VW are preparing to enlarge or scrap some of their best-selling small car engines over the next three years, the people said. Other manufacturers are expected to follow, with both diesels and gasolines affected.The reversal makes it even harder to meet carbon dioxide (CO2) targets and will challenge development budgets already stretched by a rush into electric cars and hybrids.""The techniques we've used to reduce engine capacities will no longer allow us to meet emissions standards,"" said Alain Raposo, head of powertrain at the Renault-Nissan alliance.""We're reaching the limits of downsizing,"" he said at the Paris auto show, which ends on Saturday. Renault, VW and GM's Opel all declined to comment on specific engine plans.For years, carmakers kept pace with European Union CO2 goals by shrinking engine capacities, while adding turbo chargers to make up lost power. Three-cylinder motors below one liter have become common in cars up to VW Golf-sized compacts; some  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) models run on twin-cylinders.These mini-motors sailed through official lab tests conducted - until now - on rollers at unrealistically moderate temperatures and speeds. Carmakers, regulators and green groups knew that real-world CO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions were much higher, but the discrepancy remained unresolved.All that is about to change. Starting next year, new models will be subjected to realistic on-the-road testing for NOx, with all cars required to comply by 2019. Fuel consumption and CO2 will follow two years later under a new global test standard.Independent testing in the wake of VW's exposure last year as a U.S. diesel emissions cheat has shed more light on the scale of the problem facing automakers.Carmakers' smallest European engines, when driven at higher loads than current tests allow, far exceed legal emissions levels. Heat from the souped-up turbos generates diesel NOx up to 15 times over the limit; gasoline equivalents lose fuel-efficiency and spew fine particles and carbon monoxide.""They might be doing OK in the current European test cycle, but in the real world they are not performing,"" said Pavan Potluri, an analyst with influential forecaster IHS Automotive.""So there's actually a bit of 'upsizing' going on, particularly in diesel.""IN RETREATCarmakers have kept understandably quiet about the scale of the problem or how they plan to address it. But industry sources shared details of a retreat already underway.GM will not replace its current 1.2-litre diesel when the engines are updated on a new architecture arriving in 2019, people with knowledge of the matter said. The smallest engine in the range will be 25-30 percent bigger.VW is replacing its 1.4 liter three-cylinder diesel with a four-cylinder 1.6 for cars like the Polo, they said, while Renault is planning a near-10 percent enlargement to its 1.6 liter R9M diesel, which had replaced a 1.9-litre model in 2011.In real-driving conditions, the French carmaker's 0.9-litre gasoline H4Bt injects excess fuel to prevent overheating, resulting in high emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, fine particles and carbon monoxide.Cleaning that up with exhaust technology would be too expensive, sources say, so the three-cylinder will be dropped for a larger successor developing more torque at lower regimes to stay cool.The turnaround on size is a European phenomenon, coinciding with diesel's sharp decline in smaller cars. Larger engines prevalent in North America, China and emerging markets still have room to improve real emissions by shrinking.INEVITABLE RECKONINGFiat, Renault and Opel have the worst real NOx emissions among the newest ""Euro 6"" diesels, according to test data from several countries. They now ""face the biggest burden"" of compliance costs, brokerage Evercore ISI warned last month.Such reckonings are the inevitable result of on-the-road testing, said Thomas Weber, head of research and development at Mercedes , which has nothing below four cylinders.""It becomes apparent that a small engine is not an advantage,"" Weber told Reuters. ""That's why we didn't jump on the three-cylinder engine trend."" The tougher tests may kill diesel engines smaller than 1.5 liters and gasolines below about 1.2, analysts predict. That in turn increases the challenge of meeting CO2 goals, adding urgency to the scramble for electric cars and hybrids. VW has been far more vocal about ambitious plans announced in June to sell 2-3 million electric cars annually by 2025 - about a quarter of its current vehicle production.""You can't downsize beyond a certain point, so the focus is shifting to a combination of solutions,"" said Sudeep Kaippalli, a Frost & Sullivan analyst who predicts a hybrids surge.In future, he said, ""downsizing will mean you take a smaller engine and add an electric motor to it"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

993,"Oct 05, 2016 04:31AM ET",No country for young men: Senegal's villages deserted for dreams of Europe,nan,"By Kieran GuilbertGOUDIRY, Senegal (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slumped on a bench in a village in southeast Senegal - which is lifeless but for the occasional bleating of goats and splutter of old motorcycles - Aliou Thiam has only one thing on his mind. The 28-year-old is preparing to leave behind his wife, two children and the only life he has known in the pursuit of a goal shared by many young men across Senegal: reaching Europe.""I don't have anything here. That is why I want to go, why I need to go,"" he said, glancing at several men lying nearby in the shade, snoozing through the still, sweltering afternoon. ""The only thing we know is migration,"" Thiam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Migration equals success.""Thousands of Senegalese men set off for Europe each year, risking their lives on treacherous journeys through the Sahara desert and across the Mediterranean sea. Most fail. Many die.Senegal is among the top 10 countries of origin for migrants arriving in Italy this year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says, along with countries like Eritrea, Mali and Nigeria, beset by conflict or concerns over rights abuses.But Senegal's young men are not fleeing war. Deemed economic migrants, they are seeking a better life for themselves and their families, and see Europe as the only gateway to success.It is a belief entrenched over decades as generations of Senegalese moved to Europe - in particular to France, the former colonial master - and sent money home.But more and more young men are now trying their luck with discontent over joblessness and the slow pace of development simmering in the West African nation.Despite being one of Africa's most stable and fastest-growing democracies, Senegal's average monthly income is less than $100, and around one in eight people are unemployed.The surge in migrants has sparked debate globally about whether economic migrants should be treated differently to refugees fleeing conflict, and fueled fears poverty will worsen and national stability come under threat if remittances dry up.Uneducated, untrained and unemployed, Thiam and his peers in southeastern Tambacounda, one of Senegal's poorest regions, say they have been abandoned by the government - citing undeveloped land, few jobs, and a lack of vocational training schemes.""All over Senegal, but especially outside of Dakar, there is a view that you can't make it here, but can make it in Europe,"" said Jo-Lind Roberts, chief of mission for the IOM in Senegal. ""There is a lack of hope about life in Senegal.""NO JOBS, NO FUTURETambacounda is one of Senegal's main points of departure for the thousands of young men who have headed for Europe via Libya since the North African country's 2011 uprising led to a vacuum of state authority.Two-thirds of Tambacounda's population of 700,000 live in poverty, compared to less than half on average across the nation of 15 million, according to data from Senegal's 2013 census. One in three people in Tambacounda, where the average age is 20, have no job to go to. ""All these young people are lying around doing nothing,"" said El Hadji Sao, secretary general of Goudiry, one of Tambacounda's four departments. ""It is enough to cause revolt.""In the heart of Goudiry, young men work tirelessly in wooden shacks, repairing motorbikes, welding steel and sewing clothes.Yet very few jobs exist outside of the center of Goudiry, with vast expanses of arid, unused land interrupted only by withered baobab trees and isolated villages.""To have a job with a salary here in Goudiry is impossible,"" said 35-year-old Yaya Diallo, who sees migrating to Europe as the only way to feed his wife and children. ""I have to go."" Amid thatch-roof huts and mud-brick homes, the few newly-built health centers and schools, and the odd concrete house - some crowned with solar panels and satellite TV dishes - are a testament to the importance of remittances across the region.""Everything you see is from those who have migrated ... all the projects are financed by them,"" said Moussa Kebe, who returned to Senegal after almost two years in Libya and set up an association to appeal for development in the area.""If anyone is sick ... or needs clothes or food ... we have to call on the migrants. When someone passes away, or has to name a baby, we call the migrants - they are always solicited."" RELYING ON REMITTANCES Senegalese migrants sent home at least 930 billion CFA francs ($1.6 billion) in 2015, eclipsing international aid for Senegal and accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), World Bank data shows.This figure may be far higher as it does not account for the cash-stuffed suitcases brought home by migrants, experts say.Yet remittances to Senegal could shrink as European nations tighten their borders and work becomes harder to find, said Marta Foresti of the UK-based Overseas Development Institute.Aware of this, the government is working to create more jobs in agriculture, and educate migrants about the risks of migration, said foreign ministry official Serigne Gueye.""Migration is not the El Dorado people dream of - it is walking into the lion's den,"" he said in the capital Dakar.""We want migrants to understand that what interests us is not their lives abroad, but their successful return to Senegal.""The state also backs the Program for Support for Solidarity Initiatives for Development (PAISD), which helps migrants in France to pool their earnings and invest in projects back in Senegal, from solar power systems to mechanic training schools.""The migrants, with one foot in France and one foot in Senegal, are very important in terms of remittances - they are drivers of development,"" said Raphael  Renault  (PA:RENA) of the PAISD.But informing people of the risks of migration to persuade them to stay, while relying on remittances to spur development, is an unsustainable strategy, said the Roberts of the IOM.""Only 20-30 percent of remittances are invested in society, most go straight to families,"" she said. ""You can't just trigger development over a few years - it doesn't work like that."" GENERATION GAPThe success of Goudiry's former migrants, who migrated to Europe several decades ago before returning home to retire, has inspired the younger generations to follow in their footsteps.Thousands of Senegalese headed to France in the 1960s and early 1970s when booming economic growth saw the country recruit workers from its former colonies for manual labor.Although France ended its labor migration policy in 1974, former migrants from Goudiry who entered the country illegally afterwards said their journeys were affordable and safe. But these now elderly trailblazers, most of whom found consistent work allowing them to club together money in order to finance schools, wells and water towers back home, fear that their achievements may have set a dangerous precedent.""Adventure is always difficult, but there were none of today's problems in our time,"" said 63-year-old Bocar Diallo, who went to Libya in the 1970s and flew to France, where he worked for Renault and an airport during his 33 years there.But Goudiry's young men are not listening. Armed with smartphones and televisions - paid for mainly by remittances - they are plugged into social media and TV shows offering a taste of life in Europe too tantalizing to resist.Samba Sidibe, a softly-spoken man in his twenties, said his friends from Goudiry who made it to Europe often phoned him to boast about their new lives in France, Germany and Italy.""One friend would phone me, telling me that Europe is a thousand times better than Africa,"" Sidibe said. ""I looked on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), I saw the nice pictures - it drove me to go.""Sidibe is one of hundreds of young men in Goudiry who burned through their families' savings to reach Europe, but failed.More than 1,000 men have left Goudiry for Europe since 2013, said Kebe's Association of Repatriates from Libya. While half succeeded, at least 100 died on the journey and some 350 have been flown home by the IOM and governments of Senegal and Libya.Repatriated from Libya last year, Sidibe now finds himself worse off than he could have ever imagined.""I cannot sit here empty-handed,"" he said glumly, staring at the floor. ""I must replace the money (some $2,000) to help my parents get out of this ordeal. If I don't find work, I will be forced to migrate - to try my luck one last time.""DESERT OF DEATHStarting from a bus station in Tambacounda, Goudiry's aspiring migrants take buses, mini-vans and cars through Mali and Burkina Faso to reach Niger's desert town of Agadez - the main transit point in the Sahara for those dreaming of Europe. For Senegal's young men, among the 300,000 migrants expected by the IOM to pass through Agadez this year, there begins the hellish 1,200 km (750 miles) journey to Sabha in southern Libya – a route prowled by bandits and baked by the fierce desert sun.""The desert is much, much worse than the Mediterranean or Libya, because it is a place where you have no hope,"" said Ousmane Thiam, 24, who like Kebe, spent some two years in Libya and is spokesman for the Association of Repatriates from Libya.While images of dead migrants on European shores have caused a global outcry, Africans heading for Europe may be dying in greater numbers in the Sahara than the thousands who have died in the Mediterranean, according to migration tracking group 4mi.Thiam and other men from Goudiry who crossed the Sahara recalled being wedged into cars with 20 other migrants, having so little water that they had to drink their urine, burying dead bodies along the way, and being beaten and robbed at gunpoint.""But I didn't have a choice,"" Thiam said. ""If I had gone home, people would say I was scared - that I was not a man.""Despite having endured the grueling month-long journey from Senegal to Libya, the nightmare had just begun for Samba Thiam.Thiam was asleep in a hostel for migrants in Libya's capital of Tripoli when the police burst in, arrested the 39-year-old and sent him to a prison where he would spend three months.""Sometimes they beat us while we prayed ... innocent people were gunned down when they had done nothing wrong,"" he said.""If the person leaving could see ahead to what is happening in Libya, he would not leave. But someone who is motivated by a desire to succeed, and help his family, becomes blind to this.""LIFE LEFT BEHINDDespite growing awareness of the dangers along the route to Europe, and warnings from failed migrants about what lies ahead, a rising number of Senegalese are attempting the journey.At least 6,000 Senegalese migrants have reached Italy by sea from Libya so far this year - more than the total for all of 2015, according to the latest available data from the IOM. Yet for every man who leaves for Europe, there are the families - wives, children and parents - who are left behind.Mournful and desperate for news from those who have left, these families often rely on support from their communities - having spent their last franc to buy their relative's passage.Several widows said they could not stop their husbands leaving, and were unaware of the perils of the route ahead.In Goudiry's remote village of Ainimady, 28-year-old Falmata Diallo watches a group of women gossip and giggle while stitching bright, floral murals to use as blankets and rugs.Her eyes flood with tears as she relives the moment her husband left, and the agonizing silence she has endured since he called a year ago to say his boat was in trouble. ""When he left, my whole body was dead,"" the mother-of-three said, convulsing with sobs. ""I could not say, or do, anything ... nobody could stop him from leaving."" In nearby Lombi Sadio, 74-year-old Samba Anne and his wife have struggled to cope since the their two sons drowned in 2014.""They left because they didn't have anything ... (but) they were doing everything, providing for the family,"" Anne said, cradling a photo of his sons, who died in their mid-thirties. ""When I heard about their deaths, I was finished,"" he added. ""I am not a person any more.""BREAKING POINTAs toddlers squabble over a sack of oranges and teenage boys chase a tattered football towards a goal made out of branches, former migrant Issa Thiam argues with his son about his future. Ibrahim owns a small shop, but with no other opportunities, he wants to move to Europe to improve his family's fortunes.""I know of the dangers ... but staying here is harder than the road ahead because, when you are here with nothing to eat or drink, it (life) becomes a crisis,"" the 24-year-old said.But he will not leave without his father's permission.""I will slap him or hold him back if I can - I refuse to allow him to go,"" said 68-year-old Issa. ""Senegal can advance and develop, if the young people stay here and work here.""Yet Goudiry's young men see things differently, bemoaning broken dams, the absence of mechanized farming, and a lack of factories, training schemes and development in the area.As the sun sets in Toumbouguel, with girls gutting fish and women washing rice for the evening meal, Aliou Thiam smiles wryly at the prospect of realizing a better life in Senegal. ""It is better to die than to be here,"" said Thiam. ""I have nothing here.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Magnussen wasted no time in fleeing the blaze, rapidly undoing his seatbelts and hot-footing it out of his Renault.“Just the heat,” a cool and collected Magnussen told reporters after the day’s running had concluded, even engaging in barbecue jokes.“Everything worked well on the car on the in-lap, so just saw the smoke and hopped out,” said Magnussen, adding that he had had no indication of any problems as he brought the car into the pits.While Magnussen made it back to the safety of his garage, his car remained stranded in the pitlane as fuel gushed out of the top of the airbox repeatedly catching fire which the team’s mechanics kept putting out.The team was trying out a new fuel system on Magnussen’s car in preparation for next month’s high altitude Mexican Grand Prix which had caused the problem, they said.“There was a problem with a valve on a fuel breather pipe which meant that fuel escaped from the vent, causing a fire,” said Renault technical director Nick Chester.The incident prompted a 15-minute stoppage but the fire was eventually doused and Magnussen was back out in the afternoon session, his car fitted with the old fuel system and cleaned of extinguisher foam.He set the 19th-fastest time but was encouraged by team mate Jolyon Palmer’s pace who ended the day a promising 12th. “Yeah, it’s good to see,” said Magnussen. “Let’s hope that practice three is a similar picture and that we can carry it into qualifying.”Renault have struggled this season on their return to Formula One as a full-fledged works team.But there have been signs of progress with Magnussen scoring only the team’s second ever finish in the points with his drive to 10th at the last race in Singapore.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

997,"Sep 29, 2016 07:12AM ET",Car industry puts cooperation on show in battle against Silicon Valley firms,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Eric AuchardPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms to their businesses in developing autonomous driving systems, it was evident at the Paris Motor Show this week that carmakers are seeking to fight back by cooperating in areas of technology development where previously they might have tried to compete.Three big carmakers - BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and VW's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi - announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B).Meanwhile HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV (AS:TOM2), on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary.[L8N1C50UB]Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson (ST:ERICb), Huawei[HWT.UL], Nokia (HE:NOKIA), Qualcomm (O:QCOM) and Intel (O:INTC) to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy).It's unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles.""This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple (O:AAPL) and particularly Google (O:GOOGL) represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important,"" technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said.Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years.That's a dramatic acceleration from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla (O:TSLA).""We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform,"" Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche said.Now General Motors (N:GM), Nissan (T:7201) and VW are also experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's (N:MBLY) camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr).However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models.A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply Google-owned crowd-sourced mapping unit Waze with its data will help drivers find parking spots on their smartphones via a free app.And on Thursday  Renault  (PA:RENA) said it was working with Waze on a Google Android Auto protoype for a navigation app that besides showing traffic conditions will also identify 13,000 electric car-charging stations across France.CAREFUL DRIVINGSome in the industry are also warning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety"", alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as ""hands-free"" (http://reut.rs/2d5lUiG).Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasize the need for a cautious approach.""There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial – that is why at PSA we've always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps,"" PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month.""This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away.""Among car companies there are two camps: Those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it.Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c).Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of those auto makers who want to go it alone.Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's (HK:0175) Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group's deal to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are seen as hybrid approaches to such cooperation.""The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways,"" Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.""We are either capable of doing it in-house or we are going to all the partners that we need to go to, whether it's Nvidia (O:NVDA), Mobileye or HERE.""(Story refiles to remove repetitious phrasing in paragraphs 14, 15.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The German carmaker will showcase new electric vehicle (EV) architecture underpinning a staggering June pledge to achieve annual sales of 2 million-3 million electric cars by 2025.""Everyone's watching VW - they've set out some very high expectations,"" said Ian Fletcher, an analyst with consulting firm IHS Automotive.""Brands like  Renault , Nissan and Tesla are still going to be mainstays, but there will be far greater competition for electrification.""Nissan's (T:7201) 2010 Leaf kicked off the contemporary crop of battery-only cars, joined two years later by alliance partner Renault's Zoe, a hatchback subcompact.But scarce charging points, a driving range limited to around 100 miles (160 kilometers) and cheap fossil fuel stifled mass-market demand. Renault-Nissan, whose Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn had promised to deliver 1.5 million EVs by 2016, has logged barely 350,000 sales to date. The Leaf accounts for two-thirds of those, more than any other electric model.Tesla meanwhile stormed the premium market with its Model S sports car, tallying about 130,000 sales since its launch the same year as the Zoe. Its success proved that consumers were prepared to pay $72,000 for an EV that can do 265 miles (425 km) on one charge.But that kind of range is about to be matched by mass-market vehicle brands at much lower prices, thanks to a leap in battery technology that is mirrored by sales projections. Electric cars may claim 15 percent of registrations in 2025,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Kristina Church predicts, compared with 0.4 percent last year.Chevrolet's $37,500 Bolt, arriving in U.S. showrooms late in 2016 and in Europe as the Opel Ampera-e next spring, covers 238 miles (383 km) with its 60 kilowatt-hour battery from LG Chem (KS:051910), General Motors (N:GM) announced earlier this month.""Opel is democratizing the electric car with the Ampera-e,"" Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the time.Tesla had promised to do that with its promised Model 3, but the new vehicle will trail the GM launch by at least a year, with a shorter expected range. The Bolt also travels further between charges than the entry-level Model S.""Tesla is the champion of EVs, but long-term success not guaranteed,"" Church said in a note to Barclays clients. ""Traditional manufacturers are better prepared to face future mobility trends than some believe.""In Paris, Renault will unveil a longer-range Zoe ""LR"", with an upgraded 40 kWh LG battery that can power it almost as far as its larger GM rival, company and industry sources told Reuters. The new version will go on sale almost immediately.But affiliate Nissan, which builds its own batteries in a venture with NEC (T:6701), will not be in a position to follow suit for another year, the sources said - leaving its flagship Leaf outgunned by the Bolt in the interim.Daimler will show an electric car in Paris and outline plans for as many as nine production models, a source told Reuters recently, as part of a push by German luxury heavyweights to challenge Tesla.BMW (DE:BMWG) bosses are staying home to thrash out plans to follow their i3 electric mini with an expanded EV lineup, people familiar with the matter said.They are not the only executives taking a pass on Paris - where the outcry over ""dieselgate"" and weak emissions regulation has sharpened enthusiasm for electrified motoring. Ford (N:F) and Volvo (HK:0175) are among the absentees.As if to underline growing hostility towards combustion engines in congestion-clogged cities, the French capital held its biggest ever ""Car-Free Day"" the Sunday before the show. Lawmakers voted the following day to pedestrianize the Seine's right bank, permanently closing a major traffic artery.Autonomy, a new Paris gathering of ride-sharing startups and other ""urban mobility"" operators, is also giving the traditional automotive fest a wide berth, setting up camp in a diametrically opposite corner of town.""The car show is for people who see vehicles as objects of desire,"" said organizer Maureen Houel.

But definitely Formula One and Formula E are totally compatible in America and everywhere else.""Agag said it made business sense to keep Formula One and Formula E apart and he sees scope for both to grow, even if electric racing could one day become the bigger draw.The Formula One championship has been running since 1950, with annual turnover of around $1.9 billion and one of the largest global audiences in sport after the soccer World Cup and Olympics.Formula E's cumulative TV audience in its debut season was a comparatively tiny 61.5 million, according to research firm Repucom.""If the motor industry becomes fully electric, Formula E will be the relevant championship in terms of the motor industry,"" said Agag.""But I don’t think Formula One will disappear. I think Formula One will continue, like today there are horse races but we don’t use a horse to go to the office. Combustion cars will be maybe only used for racing.""But I think Formula One has such a strong tradition that it will continue in the future. Formula E may be the main championship at one point in 50 years or 60 years, but only time will tell.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Lisbon version will have 50,000 participants, jumping from 27,500 last year in Dublin. It will be held at a huge conference venue built for Expo 98 and visitors will enjoy a city full of recently-built hotels that have fed a tourism boom.Portugal's government is hoping the event will help boost funding and other support for technology firms in an economy that is only recovering slowly after a 2011-14 bailout.Apart from tech startups, chief executives from leading companies like  Renault  (PA:RENA) Nissan are also taking part this year as the Web Summit becomes a meeting ground for technology and business, chief executive and co-founder Paddy Cosgrave said.""If you track the Web Summit, in 2010 it was a startup conference, the average age of attendees was in the mid-20s. But in 2014 it began to change, the average age is now 36, it has become very much a ... technology business conference.""The Web Summit's rapid growth brought it to Lisbon as the venue ""had simply run out of space"" in Dublin, Cosgrave said.""If you look at Lisbon, something was already happening, and I hope that the Web Summit adds to the growing wave of interest in what's happening in Lisbon and Portugal. It's difficult to explain these things. Historians can look back and explain why a city is cool.""He cited a growing number of startups in Lisbon and the decision by the founder of Berlin's co-worker startup campus ""Factory"" to open in the Portuguese capital as evidence of its growing attraction.The Web Summit's biggest point of interest this year could be in bringing together a large number of experts in the car industry on driverless cars, according to Cosgrave.He said he had a particular interest in driverless cars as he does not have a full driving license, and he believes automated vehicles are just around the corner.""When you see so many large companies in an arms race against each other (on technology for automated cars), that's where things happen.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1010,"Sep 06, 2016 10:42AM ET",Exclusive: Renault sees diesel disappearing from most of its European cars,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) expects diesel engines to disappear from most of its European cars, company sources told Reuters, after the French automaker reviewed the costs of meeting tighter emissions standards following the Volkswagen scandal.The sober reassessment was delivered at an internal meeting before the summer break. It shows how, a year after VW (DE:VOWG_p) admitted engineering software to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests, the repercussions are forcing major European car makers to rewrite strategic plans that will shape their futures for years to come.Renault and domestic rival  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), both heavily invested in diesel technology, initially scrambled to defend its future viability after the VW crisis erupted.But in the July meeting, Renault's Chief Competitiveness Officer Thierry Bollore said the diesel investment outlook had dimmed significantly, according to two people who were present.""He said we were now wondering whether diesel would survive, and that he wouldn't have voiced such doubts even at the start of this year,"" said one of the people.""Tougher standards and testing methods will increase technology costs to the point where diesel is forced out of the market,"" the source summarized Bollore as saying.A Renault spokesman declined to comment.Diesel engines, pricier but more efficient than gasoline, had already vanished from the smallest 'A'-segment vehicles like Renault's Twingo well before VW's so-called 'dieselgate', as their extra expense outstripped savings on fuel.By 2020, Renault now predicts that the toughening of Euro 6 emissions rules will push diesel out of cars in the next 'B'-segment size category, including its Clio sub compact, as well as some 'C' models such as the Megane hatchback, the sources said.Models in those first three size categories accounted for most of the group's 1.6 million European deliveries last year, and more than 60 percent were diesels.""Everybody is backtracking on diesel because after 2017-18 it becomes more and more expensive,"" said Pavan Potluri, a power train analyst with consulting firm IHS Automotive.ELECTRIC CARSWhile the VW scandal centered on the German carmaker's cheat software, it also focused public attention on an industry-wide disparity between nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions on the road and those recorded in regulatory tests.Mass-market diesels that meet legal NOx limits in approval tests commonly emit five times as much or more in everyday use. The gases contribute to acid rain and respiratory illnesses blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths globally each year.Starting in 2019, however, vehicle approvals will be based on emissions performance during real driving. This is forcing manufacturers to install costlier emissions treatment systems.The business case for diesel can only deteriorate further, industry leaders realize, as targets become stricter, while electric and hybrid car batteries get cheaper and more powerful.""Beyond 2025 there may be some manufacturers that completely drop diesel, because the cost of electrification will have come down significantly,"" Potluri said.Diesel car sales will plummet to 9 percent of the European market in 2030 from 52 percent today, management consultant AlixPartners - regarded as an authority on the auto industry - predicted in June, with the decline accelerating after 2020. Renault and alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) assume the next wave of emissions rules, Euro 7, could halve NOx output limits again to 40 milligrams per kilometer, senior powertrain engineer Alain Raposo told a technical conference this summer.Renault is not alone in predicting a bleak future for diesel, though its projections go further than the doubts expressed by other car makers about the technology.VW now wonders ""whether it still makes sense to invest a lot of money in further developing diesel"", Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in June. The German carmaker's final bill for the scandal will likely far exceed the $15 billion settlement agreed so far in U.S. fines and vehicle buy backs.Wolfsburg-based VW is the only carmaker to have admitted using illegal software cheats. Similar allegations have been leveled by German officials against  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), and by South Korean authorities against Nissan vehicles equipped with Renault engines - and in both cases denied.SKY-HIGH NOXRenault, however, has been forced to concede that its real-world NOx emissions are far worse than the industry average, and the carmaker remains under investigation by French consumer fraud authorities.That has deepened Renault's engineering headache and tarnished the green image it cultivated with electric car launches and lower-than-average emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant focus of regulators prior to dieselgate.In road tests on almost 100 vehicles, ordered by a French commission on diesel emissions, Renault and Nissan cars produced more than eight times the regulatory NOx limit on average, with most of their Euro 6 models closer to 10 times the limit.Renault engineering chief Gaspar Gascon Abellan told the commission that the NOx-cutting exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in its top-selling diesel engines had been found to cause serious turbo clogging problems.Engineers had responded by programming the EGR to shut down outside a narrow range of air intake temperatures, 17-35 degrees Celsius (63-95 degrees Fahrenheit). While passing regulatory tests carried out near room temperature, the protocol sends NOx emissions sky-high on the road.Renault, Opel (N:GM), Fiat and others have said such ""defeat devices"" are legal because they are designed to protect their engines rather than cheat tests. But the French commission said their technical justifications ""remained to be proven"".Gascon Abellan agreed during hearings that Renault's EGR restrictions ""could be considered conservative"" and would now be relaxed by software tweaks to existing models, with no significant engine changes. ""I recognize that we could have done this earlier,"" he said.In common with Ford (N:F), VW and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), Renault is scrambling to catch up with Peugeot by rolling out costlier selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to rein in NOx emissions in real-world driving.Bollore, the competitiveness chief, blamed ""diesel consequences"" in part for a 115 million euro ($128 million) research and development overspend that weakened first-half earnings.Renault's electric car program and CO2 performance remain important assets in a world of ever-tightening emissions laws, Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Stuart  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said.""But they're going to have to address the diesel issue and add more SCR content than others,"" Pearson said. ""It might be one reason why Renault's earnings could be handicapped relative to Peugeot over the next few years.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1013,"Aug 31, 2016 02:10PM ET","Investment rebound expected to end Brazilian recession, boost Temer",nan,"By Silvio Cascione and Brad HaynesBRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A rebound in spending on machinery and equipment by Brazilian companies should lead Latin America's largest economy out of a deep recession in the coming months, providing a much-needed boost for new center-right President Michel Temer.A recent survey of chief financial officers by the local American Chamber of Commerce showed nearly half of the companies had put investment and strategic decisions on hold during the impeachment of leftist President Dilma Rousseff. The Senate's dismissal of Rousseff on Wednesday on charges of breaking budget rules could unleash a wave of new investments under her successor Temer, her former vice president who has served as interim president since she was suspended in mid-May.Temer has pushed a pro-business agenda, courting investors with plans to stabilize government debt, sell public assets and offer a more predictable business environment, in a bid to pull Brazil out of what is likely to be its worst recession.The prospect that Temer could serve the remainder of Rousseff's presidential term through 2018 has helped in recent months to spur new investments, including by French auto maker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Chinese solar cell maker BYD Energy. Economic data published on Wednesday showed that total investment in the second quarter grew for the first time since mid-2013.  Further evidence of a recovery would strengthen Temer's hand in Congress as he tries to pass unpopular budget and pension reforms, the results of which will be far more important for investors than any brief post-impeachment honeymoon.For the first time in years, economists have been raising rather than cutting their growth forecasts.Imports of capital goods rose 16 percent in the second quarter, according to data from the Trade Ministry. Local production of capital goods has also grown every month this year as companies dust off their investment plans.Although the recession left significant idle capacity, several manufacturers have shown eagerness to renovate their facilities for fear of missing the start of the recovery. ""There are relevant, unambiguous signs, that the worst moments for investments are behind us already,"" said Rodolfo Margato, an economist with Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil. ""Investments will offer a significant contribution for the economy to grow 2 percent next year.""The market consensus is for Brazil's economy to grow 1.2 percent in 2017, according to a weekly central bank poll. That is well above the market's meager 0.3 percent consensus forecast four months ago.Brazil's economy, however, has underperformed economists' forecasts since 2010. ROSY OUTLOOK SHATTEREDOne of the darlings of the emerging markets, Brazil enjoyed an investment boom that began in the 1990s as companies calculated that the country of 200 million people would emerge as a major economic power.That rosy outlook was shattered by the recent recession, which began in 2014, as business confidence imploded and investment dried up. Unemployment soared - it was 11.6 percent for the three months through July - as did the number of companies filing for bankruptcy protection.A budget crisis, caused by unexpectedly fast declines in tax revenues and the government's failure to quickly curb spending, further soured investors on the country's prospects. Brazil lost its investment-grade credit rating in 2015.But green shoots have begun to appear in recent months, with a steady stream of companies announcing new capacity and upgrading of assembly lines. U.S. agrochemical maker Albaugh LLC, pulp maker Veracel Celulose SA and Chinese solar cell maker BYD Energy were among those to announce new investments.""The expectations for the Brazilian economy are still cloudy, but it seems that we are experiencing a turning point,"" Harry Schmelzer Jr, the chief executive of electrical equipment maker WEG SA (SA:WEGE3), said last month.The optimism, however, has been spread unevenly.Companies dependent on consumer spending, such as apparel retailers, are among those that may have to wait longer for relief, as stubbornly high inflation, crippling unemployment and decade-high interest rates weigh on household spending.Economists are betting that investment will expand more broadly as the central bank puts a lid on price increases and starts cutting rates.BAD INVESTMENTS Investment has plunged about 27 percent since mid-2103, and few observers expect that drop to be entirely reversed in a rebound. Most economists forecast investment growth of between 3 percent and 6 percent in 2017.""Some of these are natural investments to make up for capital depreciation and keep some competitiveness,"" said Thiago Curado, an economist with consultancy 4E in Sao Paulo. ""A relevant part of the last investment cycle was poorly allocated, so capital depreciation has been higher."" Curado suggested companies will have to make new investments if they want to adapt to the new reality.Even in devastated parts of Brazil's economy, such as the auto industry, where sales have fallen by half from their 2012 peak, companies are betting on new models and more efficient technologies to get an edge over rivals.Brazilian-born Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault (PA:RENA), announced this month that the French carmaker was investing in two new models for Brazil.""Right now we see Brazil's auto market recovery with great hope. I don't think anybody believes the Brazilian market will stay at around 2 million vehicles,"" he said, predicting the country's annual auto sales had the potential to double again.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1014,"Aug 30, 2016 05:10AM ET",VW reviews procurement strategy in wake of supplier dispute,nan,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is reviewing its supplier and procurement strategy to avoid another crippling dispute like the one that caused production slowdowns and even stoppages at six plants this month, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said.VW suppliers Car Trim and ES Automobilguss, both part of Prevent Group, triggered the disruptions by halting deliveries of seat covers and cast iron parts for gearboxes, exposing how dependent VW has become on some of its suppliers.""We will of course look into questions such as multi-sourcing, single-sourcing. And we will look at our procurement contracts and try to optimize matters with all suppliers,"" Mueller told the Hamburg Business Journalists' Club in remarks embargoed for Tuesday.""One could discuss at length who is to blame for the fact that this situation went belly up, but I will not discuss it any further,"" Mueller said, referring to the dispute with Prevent Group.Tensions between carmakers and suppliers are on the rise as both struggle to defend profits amid slower growth in China and rising investment costs to meet stricter emissions rules.The need to invest in technology for electric vehicles, smartphone compatibility and autonomous driving features has forced a wave of consolidation among auto suppliers, narrowing the choice of available partners for carmakers such as BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and  Renault  (PA:RENA). Deals in the past three years include the $12.4 billion acquisition of TRW by Germany's ZF; Magna's (TO:MG) purchase of Getrag for $1.9 billion; and Continental AG's 1.5-billion-euro deal for Veyance Technologies.  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is said to be exploring a sale of its auto parts unit Magneti Marelli.VW and two of its parts suppliers last week resolved a contract dispute that had hit output at more than half of the carmaker's German plants and threatened to undermine its recovery from a diesel emissions scandal.A similar escalation of disputes with other suppliers is less likely since VW's partners tend to be members of VDA, Germany's Auto Industry Association, and follow an agreed code of conduct for resolving disagreements.Prevent Group, was not a member of the VDA, Mueller said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1015,"Aug 28, 2016 01:18PM ET",Rosberg eases to victory in chaotic Belgian GP,nan,"By Abhishek TakleGerman Nico Rosberg steered clear of the chaos unfolding behind him and cruised to an unchallenged win in a disrupted Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday. His Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton, the world championship leader, finished third from the back row of the grid, behind Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Rosberg started on pole and kept the lead after his main rivals, fellow front-row starter Max Verstappen and the Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) pair of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel, collided at the first corner. That allowed Rosberg to run away at the front and he crossed the line 14.1 seconds ahead of Ricciardo. The race was briefly halted with nine of the 44 laps completed after a massive crash for Kevin Magnussen, who lost control of his  Renault  (PA:RENA) as he crested the fearsome Eau Rouge. The Dane, who was taken to hospital for routine checks after suffering a cut to his left ankle, slammed violently into the barriers, prompting officials to first deploy the safety car and then the red flag as marshals worked to repair the damage. “In general, yes, I had everything under control,” Rosberg told reporters. “I just had an awesome car and Lewis wasn’t there to battle it out, which made it a less difficult weekend.” Sunday’s win was the 20th of the Rosberg’s career and sixth of the season. But it was the 31-year-old’s first since June’s European Grand Prix, reigniting his title challenge after a run of lackluster races in which he steadily lost ground to Hamilton. The Briton, winner of six of the last seven races leading up to the Belgian round, still leads the championship but by a narrower nine-point margin with eight of a record 21 races still to run. The triple champion, who had gone into the weekend gunning to become only the third ever driver to score 50 career wins, was happy to come away with a podium finish. “I honestly didn’t know what was going to happen in the race,” said Hamilton, whose rise up the order was helped by the opening lap collisions and race disruptions. “I really can’t believe we came so far up to be honest.” Nico Hulkenberg, who ran as high as second at one stage, finished fourth for Force India. Team mate Sergio Perez was fifth, on a strong day for the Silverstone-based team that took them ahead of Williams into fourth in the constructors’ standings. Vettel fought back to finish sixth ahead of Fernando Alonso who also enjoyed a strong race having started dead last. Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen, who had fallen one lap behind the leaders after the opening lap tangle, was ninth with Red Bull's Verstappen finishing a disappointing 11th.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1023,"Aug 15, 2016 01:33AM ET",Nissan revolution: could new petrol engine make diesel obsolete?,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuATSUGI, Japan (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) has come up with a new type of gasoline engine it says may make some of today's advanced diesel engines obsolete.The new engine uses variable compression technology, which Nissan engineers say allows it at any given moment to choose an optimal compression ratio for combustion - a key factor in the trade-off between power and efficiency in all gasoline-fuelled engines.The technology gives the new engine the performance of turbo-charged gasoline engines while matching the power and fuel economy of today's diesel and hybrid powertrains - a level of performance and efficiency the conventional gasoline engine has so far struggled to achieve.The potential breakthrough technology comes at a time when diesel engine technology has been tarnished by Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) emissions cheating scandal.The German automaker admitted last year to using secret software to cheat exhaust emissions tests on its diesel cars, affecting millions of vehicles worldwide, and prompting the departure of the company's CEO and other executives.""Diesel engine is a hot topic globally. We believe this new engine of ours is an ultimate gasoline engine that could over time replace the (advanced) diesel engine of today,"" Kinichi Tanuma, a senior Nissan engineer who leads product development for the premium Infiniti brand, told reporters at a pre-launch briefing last month.""Everyone's been working on variable compression and other technologies to significantly improve gasoline engine fuel economy ... at least for the last 20 years or so,"" said James Chao, Asia-Pacific managing director at consultant IHS.""Increasing the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines is critical to automakers. Not all consumers will accept a battery electric vehicle solution. But significant challenges remain, such as increased complexity and cost, as well as potential vibration issues.""TO INFINITI ... AND BEYONDThe new Variable Compression-Turbo (VC-T) powertrain, expected to be officially unveiled at next month's Paris motor show, will initially be showcased in an Infiniti car to be unveiled next year, Nissan engineers said, without elaborating. Eventually, it's expected to be used in Nissan cars and possibly by its alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA).The turbo-charged, 2-liter, four-cylinder VC-T engine averages 27 percent better fuel economy than the 3.5-liter V6 engine it replaces, with comparable power and torque. Nissan says the new engine matches the diesel engine in torque – the amount of thrust that helps determine the car's acceleration.The engine is also cheaper than today's advanced turbo-charged diesel engines, Nissan engineers said at the briefing at the company's technical and design center in Atsugi, south of Tokyo. They said it should also meet nitrogen oxide (NOx) and other emissions rules in certain markets without requiring costly treatment systems.OPTIMAL RATIOThe compression ratio measures how much the air-fuel mix is reduced, or compressed, in the gasoline engine's cylinders before it's ignited and produces energy. The higher the ratio, the more efficiently the engine works, producing better fuel economy and, with the addition of a turbo-charger, more power.Traditionally, design engineers had to fix a gasoline engine's combustion compression ratio, essentially deciding whether to go for power or economy.Nissan says the new VC-T engine can choose an optimal compression ratio variably between 8:1 and 14:1. That compares with mainstream production gasoline engines that run at compression ratios of 8:1 to 10:1. Exotic sports cars and racing cars run at 12:1 or more. ""We think the VC-T engine could replace or become an alternative to some of today's advanced diesel engines,"" Tanuma said, noting the new engine's fuel economy and performance could be significantly boosted by coupling it to a gasoline-electric hybrid system, an option Nissan said it's considering.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The company is jointly owned by NEC Corp (T:6701).The Nikkei daily on Friday reported that Nissan was looking to sell the company because it would be cheaper to buy batteries for its electric vehicles including its Leaf model from other makers. The newspaper did not say where it obtained the information.Talk of the sale ""is speculation, and is not based on any announcement by us"", Nissan said in an email. Spokesmen for Panasonic and NEC declined to comment. Competition to supply batteries for electric vehicles is heating up due to expectations that a growing number of lower emission cars will be produced in the coming years.  Tesla Motors  (O:TSLA), which currently procures batteries for its electric vehicles from Panasonic, is planning to boost its total vehicle production to 500,000 in 2018 - two years earlier than its original target.Nissan and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), under Carlos Ghosn, who heads both companies, have bet more heavily on electric cars than mainstream competitors. In 2009 the two companies pledged to invest 4 billion euros ($4.43 billion) to build models including the Nissan Leaf compact and as many as 500,000 batteries per year to power them.Sales of the Leaf and those of other electrical vehicles, however, have been disappointing, meaning Nissan and NEC have been unable to lower battery costs through mass production.Reuters reported in 2014 that Ghosn was preparing to cut battery production by AESC and instead use packs made by LG Chem (KS:051910).Nissan is also in the process of selling its 41 percent stake in auto parts supplier  Calsonic Kansei Corp  (T:7248), sources have told Reuters. In May, the automaker agreed to buy a 34-percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) for about $2.2 billion as it seeks to better compete with bigger rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) .  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1030,"Aug 04, 2016 01:30PM ET",Exclusive: Global firms beef up investigations of Indian mica suppliers after exposé on child deaths,nan,"By Nita Bhalla and Rina ChandranDELHI/MUMBAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major global companies buying the mineral mica from India vowed on Thursday to beef up inspections of their suppliers for child labor after a Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation revealed children were dying in illegal mines.A three-month investigation in the mica-producing states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh found at least seven children have been killed since June mining for mica, the valued mineral that puts a sparkle in make-up and car paint.These deaths, feared to be just the tip of the iceberg, have gone unreported as victims' impoverished families and mine operators do not want to end the illegal mining in abandoned mines and protected forests - often their only source of income.While officials in Jharkhand and Rajasthan vowed to investigate child deaths following the expose, major companies buying from India said they would examine suppliers - and could stop buying from India without more efforts to end child labor.""We have immediately started investigations with our direct suppliers,"" said a spokesman from German car manufacturer Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), adding that a meeting with suppliers was now scheduled for later this month.""Based on the outcome of the results of our investigations we will take corresponding actions based on our internal processes.""BMW said it did not tolerate child labor.""If the allegations are substantiated, we will do everything to ensure that the supplier involved is no longer part of our supply chain in the future,"" a company spokesman said.Other big car makers in India - Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Honda, Audi, Mercedes Benz,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Mahindra and Tata Motors - did not respond to requests for comments.BOYCOTTS AND ALTERNATIVESIndian law forbids children below the age of 18 working in mines and other hazardous industries but many families living in extreme poverty rely on children to boost household income.India is one of the world's largest producers of mica, a silver-coloured, crystalline mineral, that has gained prominence in recent years as an environmentally-friendly material, used in the car and building sectors, electronics and ""natural"" make-up.This surge in demand has revived a flagging industry in India which closed most of its 700 mines employing over 20,000 workers in the 1980s following stricter laws to limit deforestation and the discovery of substitutes for natural mica.In 2013/14 India produced 19,000 tonnes of mica, according to the Bureau of Mines, but exported 128,000 tonnes, with the biggest buyers China, Japan, and the United States.It is estimated up to 70 percent of India's mica is produced in illegal mines falling into disrepair. Activists have called for more funding to provide schooling and alternative livelihoods in mica areas which are some of the poorest regions.Rajesh Malhotra, spokesman for the Ministry of Power, Coal and Renewable Energy, said the government has dedicated funds for the welfare of local people in mining areas which will generate $1 billion annually to support various programs.He listed water, health, education, training, child welfare and sustainable livelihoods as priorities.Some companies are supporting these community initiatives.Major buyer, Chinese pigment manufacturer Fujian Kuncai Material Technology Co Ltd, said changes were ""urgently needed"" and called on all parties involved in the supply chain to act.Mike Tijdink, general manager of Kuncai Europe, said the manufacturer was setting up its own company in India this month to source directly from mines, working with NGO Terre des Hommes to help communities, and had started making synthetic mica.""If we are not able to create a child labor free and legal mica industry in India, the industry could consider the switch toward an undisputed product like synthetic mica,"" he said.German drugmaker Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA, which cut some suppliers after it discovered children collecting mica at some mines in 2008, reiterated its condemnation of child labor.While some companies invest in communities, others say they cannot guarantee supplies are child labor free so have stopped using mica, 10 percent of which goes into cosmetics.British cosmetics company Lush, which prides itself on its handmade products and ethical trading, switched from natural to synthetic mica in 2014 due to concerns about child labor and described revelations of child deaths in mines as ""atrocious"".""No industry should result in the loss of life, let alone that of children,"" Lush's head of ethical buying, Simon Constantine, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.""We continue to choose a boycott of natural mica until greater transparency and assurances can be given on ethical supply ... We only hope that other companies see this reporting and are as shocked into action as we have been.""A spokeswoman from L'Oreal said the company was only buying from a ""limited number of trusted suppliers who have committed to sourcing only from legal gated mines where working conditions are closely monitored and human rights are respected"".Estee Lauder did not respond to requests for comment.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1032,"Jul 28, 2016 07:02AM ET",Fall in Volkswagen brand profit shows lasting effects of scandal,nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) reported a 12 percent drop in quarterly profit at its main passenger car division on Thursday, a big improvement on the quarter before but showing the challenges it still faces to overcome its emissions scandal.Europe's largest automaker is struggling to rebuild its reputation and meet billions of dollars of costs after admitting in September to installing illegal software to mask toxic emissions on about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. The German company published headline first-half numbers last week, saying underlying operating profit of 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) beat analysts' expectations largely due to improvements at its mass-market VW brand.The brand, Volkswagen's largest by revenues, saw profits plunge 86 percent in the first quarter.However, some analysts said the drop in the division's second-quarter earnings showed there was still much work to do.""Some of the details are mediocre, especially the VW brand result,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Sascha Gommel of the company's full first-half earnings release. ""The numbers are slightly disappointing, the brand's earnings quality is still not good,"" he added, noting higher plant utilization at the brand in the second quarter had not translated into improved profits. Commerzbank has a ""hold"" rating on Volkswagen shares, which were down 2 percent at 1020 GMT. LAGGING MARGINSThe company said operating profit at the VW brand fell to 808 million euros in April-June, down from 914 million a year earlier, as expenses related to the emissions scandal and lower sales outweighed cost cutting. That gave the brand a quarterly profit margin of 2.9 percent, up from 0.3 percent in the first quarter, but down from 3.3 percent in the same period last year and still well short of the levels achieved by rivals such as Toyota (T:7203), PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) and  Renault  (PA:RENA).In a bid to catch up, Volkswagen is speeding up model development, slashing costs and ceding more power to regional operations to target markets more effectively. The company said exchange rate moves and higher sales of cheaper cars compared with the same period last year were also factors behind the fall in VW brand earnings. At 1.5 billion euros, the brand also bore the brunt of 2.2 billion euros of additional provisions made in January-June to cover the costs of the emissions scandal, VW said.Analysts have said lasting progress in raising the VW brand's profitability will depend on ongoing talks between management and labor over strategy and the future of Germany's high-cost factories.VW's powerful unions are seeking fixed targets for production and investment in the talks with brand chief Herbert Diess, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive hired a year ago to turn around the business.""Mass-market carmakers are all very profitable at the moment,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst who recommends buying VW stock. ""The VW brand margin has to improve considerably.""Volkswagen has pledged greater investment in electric cars and on-demand transport services as it reshapes its business.The group stuck to its 2016 guidance, predicting revenues would fall by as much as 5 percent amid weak demand in South America and Russia as well as volatile exchange rates. It forecast a group operating margin of 5 to 6 percent, versus 6 percent in 2015, adjusted for special items.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1033,"Jul 25, 2016 09:00AM ET","Ukraine, after war, becomes a trove for black market arms trade",nan,"By Alessandra Prentice and Anton ZverevSLOVIANSK, Ukraine/MOSCOW (Reuters) - On Feb. 12 last year, the same day that a ceasefire ended the worst of the fighting in eastern Ukraine between rebels and government forces, a former rebel fighter seized a chance to turn his inside knowledge of the conflict into hard cash.He traveled to a spot on the Russian-Ukrainian border where he retrieved a cache of weapons hidden there earlier by his comrades in the pro-Russian rebel movement.Four days later, shortly before 6:00 p.m., he and a friend showed up in a taxi at a fuel station in western Russia where they had arranged to meet a contact ready to buy the arms, according to Russian court documents.He and the friend opened the trunk of the taxi, and began transferring the cargo into the buyer's vehicle. Concealed in a sports bag and a rucksack were three automatic weapons, 1,258 bullets, 20 grenades, and 20 detonators for the grenades.The buyer was an undercover police officer and the former rebel, identified in the court documents as Y.V. Mikhailov, was sentenced this year to two and a half years in jail.The fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Moscow-backed separatists and Ukraine's pro-Western government killed hundreds of people, displaced thousands of residents and created a Cold War-style stand off between Moscow in the West.It also had another consequence that is less visible but could in time prove equally dangerous: the conflict took huge amounts of arms out of government arsenals and put them in the hands of irregular units unable to properly control them.Now the fighting has subsided, according to security officials and experts on the arms trade, the weapons are getting into the hands of criminals and being spirited to buyers well beyond the conflict zone.Interviews by Reuters with security officials and rebels, as well as study of law enforcement data and court documents have shown that weapons are being channeled out of the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine in significant numbers, in some cases as part of an organized underground trade.""Of course, they have moved arms across, and they're moving them across now,"" Igor, a fighter with a pro-Russian rebel unit in eastern Ukraine told Reuters in an interview. ""Mainly they take Kalashnikovs,"" he said.ARSENALS PILLAGEDWhen, in the spring of 2014, the armed rebellion started in Ukraine's Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, police and soldiers abandoned their bases.That left the rebel militias to pillage the stores where Ukraine -- one of the world's biggest arms manufacturers - kept its sizable arsenal.Meanwhile on the pro-Ukrainian side, because the army was in near-collapse, irregular militias were formed, some of them only loosely part of the chain of command, and they were given, or scavenged, weapons from official supplies.While the fighting raged, the weapons stayed in the conflict zone. In February 2015, the sides in the conflict agreed a ceasefire. The fighting did not stop, but the intensity subsided, and weapons started leaking out of the battlefield.Official data is patchy but what figures there are indicate the problem is getting worse. The number of prosecutions for weapons offences so far this year in Ukraine is double the amount for the whole of 2015, according to the general prosecutor's office.In many cases, the cause is negligence. Irregular units often do not keep proper control of the weapons in their inventories or fail to make soldiers surrender their guns when they go on leave.“It’s mostly people taking them home for the sake of it,"" said Serhiy Alyoshin, the chief of police in the town of Sloviansk, which is on the edge of the conflict zone and controlled by Kiev.""Some say ‘I forgot’, some say ‘It’s for fishing’ or ‘It’s a present for a friend’ and then we hear about these things blowing up in apartments, in yards and on the street. It’s a threat to national security.”In some cases, Ukrainian security officials said, irregular pro-government units set up private weapons caches to avoid surrendering their arms to the authorities in Kiev, whom they do not trust.In March this year, the police force in Sloviansk uncovered a cache of weapons and explosives in the back of a garage filled with cardboard boxes and household junk.In police footage seen by Reuters, officers laid the weapons and explosives out on the ground. There were at least three anti-tank rocket launchers, several rockets, hundreds of bullets, around 15 hand grenades and two anti-tank mines. ORGANIZED CRIMEBut there is evidence too of criminal intent to smuggle weapons out for sale to organized crime groups.""Of course, anyone who has the will and the means can get into the business - organized criminal groups have always traded weapons,"" said Olena Hitlyanska, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's State Security service, or SBU. ""Now the channel for buying these illegal weapons has widened,"" she said.""In past years we seized pistols and rifles that people had in their own collections or for hunting. Now grenade launchers are seized, and blocks of TNT.""Igor, the rebel fighter, said there was now a well-organized trade in illegal weapons from eastern Ukraine into Russia.""If before they shipped whatever came to hand, now it happens in a more orderly fashion, practically by appointment,"" said Igor, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of reprisals for speaking about the trade.In one rebel unit ""they practically keep a list of who will take the iron across the border and when,"" he said, using a slang term for weapons.He said the weapons were smuggled from rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine into Russia via illegal border crossings.He said much of the smuggling was done by rebel fighters from Chechnya and Ingushetia, in Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, who ship the weapons back home. A spokesman for the rebel administration in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, Eduard Basurin, said about arms smuggling: ""Maybe at one point it was present, but that this is being done in an orchestrated way, that's rubbish."" DESTINATION: MIDDLE EASTSo far, there is little evidence of where the weapons smuggled out of the Ukraine conflict zone end up.In May, Ukrainian border guards detained a 25-year-old Frenchman with ties to far-right groups in France who was trying to cross from Ukraine into Poland with weapons including rocket launchers and Kalashnikov assault rifles in his  Renault  (PA:RENA) van.Ukraine's SBU said the man had made contact with armed militias in Ukraine and inquired about buying arms from them. When they found out about this, the SBU said its agents sold the man deactivated weapons. But that case appears to be an outlier. The illegal arms trade in western Europe -- where the items most in demand are small quantities of light firearms -- is dominated by supplies from ex-Yugoslavia, and it is unlikely Ukrainian weapons would be able to break into that market.Instead, most of the weapons from Ukraine will be destined for other conflict zones in places such as Iraq, Syria and Libya where there is a demand for heavy weapons in large enough quantities to make it worthwhile for black market arms dealers.Mark Galeotti, an expert on ex-Soviet organized crime, said some of those Ukrainian weapons would be transported through the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa, then into the Mediterranean, some south through the Balkans, and some through Russia's North Caucasus region.""Usually it is relatively easy to get a pistol or anything up to an assault rifle,"" said Galeotti, senior research fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague.""But it is much harder to get an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) or a machine gun or the boring things like spare parts for the above. You actually need to have a proper war for these sorts of things to become available and, lo and behold, you have a proper war,"" he said.""At the moment you have, from the criminals' point of view, a wonderful opportunity.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Weaker markets in the United States and also China, where sales of construction equipment are falling, will test the new leadership team's skill in boosting profitability.""In the second quarter we were able to continue the improvement of our underlying profitability despite declining sales, thanks to positive cost development,"" said CEO Martin Lundstedt, a former Scania boss appointed last year. Scania had long boasted some of the best profit margins in the business.Gothenburg-based Volvo said order intake of its trucks fell 8 percent in the second quarter compared with a 1 percent drop seen by analysts. A 29 percent fall in North American truck orders led the decline.Volvo shares rose 0.8 percent by 0756 GMT (03:56 a.m. EDT), outpacing a 0.7 percent fall in the in the STOXX Europe 600 Industrial Goods & Services Index (SXNP). The stock is up 12 percent so far this year compared with a 2 percent drop for the index.""The earnings are really good, and what stands out is primarily the 10 percent operating margin in trucks despite them scaling back output in North America,"" Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said. ""This is exactly what one wanted to see.""Lundstedt has come on board as Volvo begins reaping the benefits of a 10 billion Swedish crown ($1.17 billion) cost cutting drive intended to make the sprawling group less prone to sharp swings in profitability as cyclical truck markets periodically slump. The group said adjusted operating earnings rose to 6.13 billion crowns from a year-ago 5.98 billion, beating a mean forecast for 5.64 billion in Reuters poll of analysts. It reported adjusted operating margin of 7.8 percent compared with a year-ago 7.1 percent and the 7.0 percent seen by analysts.""The results tells us that Volvo are on track to boost its earnings generation capacity also when demand is not great,"" said Danske Bank analyst Bjorn Enarson.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1038,"Jul 15, 2016 02:10AM ET",European car sales rise 6.5 percent in June despite U.K dip: ACEA,nan,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European sales of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) cars dipped in June, a month of rising demand in most large markets which helped rival volume brands  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Mazda (T:7261), Kia (KS:000270) and Hyundai (KS:005380) post double digit percentage sales gains.Car registrations in Britain, Europe's second-biggest car market behind Germany, fell 0.8 percent in June, the second drop in more than four years, weighed by a 20 percent decline in VW sales and an uncertain economic outlook.VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is grappling with the biggest business crisis in its 78-year history after admitting in September it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests for toxic nitrogen oxide and in November that it also understated carbon dioxide emissions.Overall, European car sales jumped as most volume and premium brands saw double-digit growth rates, data provided the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) showed on Friday.Registrations of June monthly new car sales in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association increased 6.5 percent on the year, to 1,507,303 vehicles, ACEA said.Passenger car registrations in the European Union rose for the 34th consecutive month, with June registrations reaching 1,459,508 new cars.Two of Europe's five biggest markets recorded double-digitsales gains, led by Italy and Spain where registrations rose 11.9 percent and 11.2 percent respectively, while French sales increased 0.8 percent and the region's No.1 market Germany posted 8.3 percent growth. Last month's expansion was driven by mass market manufacturers Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles'(FCA) Fiat brand, jumping and 21.2 percent and 13.9 percent respectively, ACEA said. Germany's luxury carmakers also boosted sales, with the core Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) brand sales jumping 16.1 percent and 14.6 percent respectively, while Volkswagen-owned luxury brand Audi (DE:NSUG) saw flat sales. In early June, the European auto industry association ACEA hiked its 2016 EU sales forecast to 14 million passenger cars or 5 percent growth year-on-year, compared with an earlier forecast of 2 percent sales growth, predicted in January.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1039,"Jul 13, 2016 05:22AM ET",Peugeot tests Israeli range-extender technology in electric car push,nan,"By Tova Cohen and Laurence FrostTEL AVIV/PARIS (Reuters) - PSA Group is preparing to test battery-powered cars that recharge with an on-board generator, industry sources said, as the French carmaker hunts for a breakthrough in mass-market electric vehicles to catch rivals Toyota and Renault-Nissan.Sales of so-called range extenders, pioneered by General Motors (NYSE:GM) in the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, will multiply as the gasoline generators become lighter and more efficient, according to the technology's backers. That could allow electric cars to carry smaller batteries, shedding more weight and cost. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli startup, said a major European carmaker had agreed to fund further development and road tests of its single-piston generator design, declining to identify the customer. But Paris-based PSA, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars, confirmed its involvement.""We are evaluating the technology,"" said PSA Research and Development Director Gilles Le Borgne. ""Nothing has been decided yet.""PSA, which declined further comment, is pursuing an ambitious turnaround following a 2012-14 crisis that saw it fall behind competitors on research and development until it secured a cash bailout from the French state and China's Dongfeng. Chief Executive Carlos Tavares has pledged to introduce 11 new electric and hybrid models by 2021.To meet ever-tightening carbon emission limits, carmakers will need popular, affordable vehicles that draw more heavily on electric propulsion. Demand for pure-electric cars remains marginal in most markets, held back by their limited range and costly batteries, even after significant government incentives.Hybrids like the Toyota Prius, which next year marks the 20th anniversary of its original version's launch, combine a battery and electric motors with a combustion engine, both driving the transmission mechanically. But fuel savings are limited by the system's added weight, complexity and cost, making it unsuitable for small mass-market vehicles.Range extenders like the Volt's 1.4-litre engine or the two-cylinder generator aboard BMW's i3 offer a different compromise, kicking in to keep the electric motors humming only when the battery runs low. As with hybrids, however, their heft cuts the distance that can be covered before that happens.In a rethink of engine fundamentals, Aquarius has pared the range extender down to a single piston that blasts to and fro inside a valveless 600cc cylinder, generating power from electromagnetic coils with each stroke. It delivers more than twice the overall energy efficiency of a typical combustion engine, according to simulations by German engineering firm FEV.""If the concept works in reality it's going to have a lot of potential,"" said Pavan Potluri, a powertrain analyst with industry consulting firm IHS Automotive.""But vehicle manufacturers are always very risk-averse, so the biggest challenge may be getting one to sign up to it.""PSA has some risk-taking form. In 2013 it developed a fuel-efficient ""Hybrid Air"" system with Bosch and was ready to take the pneumatic-hydraulic drivetrain into production, but failed to find another manufacturer willing to split the investment.According to Aquarius, several prototype vehicles using its free-piston generator will be road-tested by the carmaker client early in 2017.At an estimated $17,000 per vehicle, costs should undercut both conventional hybrids that come in closer to $25,000 and pure-electrics at around $40,000, the private company projects.""Aquarius offers an alternative to a 100-percent electric vehicle,"" advisory board member Efraim Wasservogel said. With ultra-low emissions, it reduces the required quantity of battery cells ""that no one knows how to recycle"", he added.Not everyone is convinced. Many industry leaders believe adding a combustion engine harms the zero-emissions appeal of electric cars as well as their eligibility for green incentives.While more than half of BMW's i3 customers opted for a range extender with the original model, that proportion is ""substantially lower"" since a revamp improved battery range, the company said. Toyota unveiled its own free-piston generator design in 2014 but has yet to announce plans for the technology. Renault  (PA:RENA), a first-mover in the current generation of electric cars with alliance partner Nissan, has its own prototype two-stroke range extender and no intention of using it, according to a senior alliance engineer. The carmaker, PSA's domestic rival, had also reviewed the Aquarius kit and decided to pass, he said.Instead, Renault-Nissan is pinning its hopes for electric cars on future improvements in battery performance and cost, alliance Senior Vice President Arnaud Deboeuf said recently. ""We're going to extend their range,"" Deboeuf said. ""But we'll do it without range extenders.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1040,"Jul 09, 2016 03:41PM ET",Palmer angered by track limits 'mess',nan,"By Alan BaldwinSILVERSTONE, England (Reuters) - A zero tolerance approach to drivers who go off track risks turning the British Grand Prix into ""a mess"" and penalties must be applied fairly,  Renault  (PA:RENA) rookie Jolyon Palmer said on Saturday.Formula One drivers were warned in their Friday briefing that anyone who went off track with all four wheels at the Stowe, Copse and Club corners, where there was an advantage to be gained, would face stewards' action.Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton was one of those who fell foul of the rules in qualifying, the Mercedes driver having his first quick lap deleted because he went fully over the white line at Copse. ""It’s rubbish for the fans because... Hamilton’s on (provisional) pole but then he gets the time deleted and then he was on the pole in the end anyway,"" said Palmer.""It’s just confusing. I saw (Force India's Nico) Hulkenberg’s time in Q3 (the final phase) got changed after the session had finished,"" added the Briton.""It’s a real problem I think because it makes it more confusing for fans and less enjoyable because you have to wait until it’s definitely been verified.""Palmer, yet to score a point in his first season, qualified 18th after having a lap deleted.Danish team mate Kevin Magnussen, who appeared to exceed the limits without being punished, starts 16th.""I don’t have a problem with your time getting deleted if you go over the track limits but I have a problem with going over the track limits and not having your time deleted, which is the case I think for some people,"" said Palmer.""We all know the rules. So long as it’s policed properly. I think maybe there were some that were not policed properly... It’ll be the same mess (in the race) I think.""Last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix dealt with the problem by installing harsh kerbs that risked damaging suspensions. Silverstone, a former airfield, has more room and runoff.In the first phase of Saturday's qualifying, McLaren's Jenson Button got out of his car after being eliminated and then hurriedly returned when it appeared Magnussen might have his best lap deleted.That would have sent Button into the second phase instead of the Dane but the stewards took no action.""It’s just really stupid when some people can seemingly go four wheels off and get away with it. And then some people get their times deleted,"" said Palmer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""But it's very difficult to say today what that impact will be.""Since the creation of the Franco-Japanese alliance in 1999, when  Renault  took a controlling stake in Nissan, it has combined some vehicle architectures, manufacturing assets and corporate functions, but at a pace that has frustrated some investors.Prodded by analysts early last year to set a more ambitious goal for synergies in 2016 than the 4.3 billion euros announced, Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, who heads both companies, said: ""Obviously 4.3 billion euros is a conservative number. I think a reasonable target would be 5 billion euros.""But following a protracted governance dispute last year with the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, tentative internal plans to announce major new areas of operational convergence early in 2016 did not materialize.Renault-Nissan said in March it would combine quality and costing teams to support integration already underway in engineering, manufacturing, supply chain management, purchasing and human resources, while preparing initiatives in after-sales.Deboeuf, who leads alliance convergence, did not repeat the 5 billion-euro objective for 2016, warning instead that savings may decline with manufacturing cycles before resuming their growth to a promised 5.5 billion euros in 2018.""There might be some years when we are down because the way you calculate is very linked to the product plan,"" he said.The 2018 target amounts to average savings growth of 8.6 percent over three years, compared with gains of 13 percent last year and 31 percent in 2014.Last year's figure of 4.3 billion effectively met the initial ""conservative"" goal for 2016 a year early.Deboeuf said projected savings did not include Nissan's acquisition of Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), which is yet to close, or the repercussions of Brexit for operations such as Nissan's plant in Sunderland, northeast England.Depending on the terms negotiated, Britain's departure from the EU could result in new trade tariffs that would penalize the plant's vehicle exports to the EU and beyond.""Concerning Brexit, we are a little worried because of the uncertainty caused by the waiting and the consequences of the new status of the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" Chief Executive Ghosn said in a statement on Monday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Our aim in this is to safeguard our employees' pension benefits for the long term. ""Regardless of the share transfer we will continue the successful strategic alliance with the Renault/Nissan Alliance.""Daimler said the transfer would result in a one-time positive impact to its 2016 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of about 0.5 billon euros.The German carmaker has already topped up its German pension fund to help to meet long-term payout obligations. It made a 1 billion euros contribution in December 2015, and a 2.5 billion euros payment in 2014. Daimler acquired 3.1 percent in the share capital of Renault and Nissan in 2010 as part of a reciprocal investment to accompany a strategic partnership for sharing engines, platforms and manufacturing facilities between Renault Nissan and Daimler. Earlier this year, Daimler expressed concerns about the French government's attempts to increase its voting rights in the French carmaker because of a divergence from the ""one share one vote principle.""The French government, which recently increased its stake in Renault, proposed introducing a law to grant double voting rights to long term-shareholders.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1047,"Jun 23, 2016 10:30AM ET","'Focus on cars', IT pioneer tells Romania's rising software stars",nan,"By Luiza IlieBUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania has emerged as one of Europe's most active technology hubs, with the IT industry posting stellar growth and benefiting from a highly-skilled local labor pool as well as one of the fastest internet speeds in the world. To keep up momentum and cement its reputation, Romania's best-known technology pioneer says local developers should focus on creating software for the car and global services industries –- shunning local market needs in favor of more mature, lucrative sectors. Multinational companies such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have set up in the former communist country in customer support, business process outsourcing and software development, and young entrepreneurs have launched a wave of new startups, creating an industry with turnover of 3.1 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in 2015. IT is becoming ever more important to the national economy -- the sector exports around 70 percent of its output, and could generate around 3 percent of GDP in three years' time, according to an industry study. ""The Romanian technology industry doesn't stand a chance if it develops products exclusively for the local market, because its needs are 10-15 years behind that of mature markets,"" said Florin Talpes, chief executive of Bitdefender, a home-grown cyber security company with half a billion users worldwide. ""If we look at which Romanian markets are mature and state of the art, that is where I would recommend developing technology industries,"" he told Reuters in an interview. Romania's auto industry is one of the eastern European country's main growth drivers, through carmaker Dacia, owned by French  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Ford. Romania is also home to countless car parts producers and research centers. ""Intelligent cars, connected cars are a main theme in at least five of these research and development centers,"" said 59-year-old Talpes. Set up in the 1960s after Romania signed a license contract with Renault, Dacia cars were for decades the ubiquitous automobile of communist Romania.Renault acquired Dacia in 1999 and the no-frills brand has since developed into a top seller for Renault, which is working on driver-less technology and car connectivity -- enabling occupants to connect to the Internet and cloud services.Another potential growth area was the IT services sector, where local software engineers should develop value-added products for the dominant multinationals present in Romania. UNEXPECTED LEGACY Romania's technology expertise is partly the result of a 1980s education drive spearheaded by the communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. With schools already leaning heavily toward science and mathematics, he promoted computer research and technology to promote pride in the nation – laying the foundations for a wave of tech-savy youngsters decades later.Romania has even made a name for itself in hacking. A 24 year-old Romanian, Razvan Cernaianu, hacked the Pentagon, NASA and Britain's Royal Navy several years ago. Some also honed their skills through software piracy. There are roughly 14,000 IT firms active in Romania, employing over 75,000 people, according to a study by industry body ARIES Transilvania.The government's Invest Romania unit, says the IT and Communications sector could be worth 4 billion euros by 2020 – up from 2.1 billion in 2013, with year-on-year growth of 9 percent. The country has more engineers per capita in the sector than the US, India, China or Russia, it says.According to the most recent figures, 2014 saw 3.6 billion euros worth of foreign investment into the sector.The IT product development sector was not without problems, Talpes said, including difficult access to financing, lack of business and marketing skills, as well as a shortage of programmers and a need for the education sector to catch up with the times.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Five are likely to secure slots.""The fun thing would be for a gamer to win it against the professional drivers. I think it’s going to be very tough,"" said Agag of the race.""We are only going to disclose and show the virtual track to all the players that morning. It’s going to be like the real Formula E. You come for the first time to a city and race in a city, you never practice before.""Gamers...are normally better at games than drivers. On the other hand, drivers are better than gamers at quickly getting the feel of a racetrack. It’s going to be an interesting competition.""VIRTUAL REALITYMany sports, including Formula One which raced in the past in Las Vegas and has been linked to a return to the famed strip, are experimenting with virtual reality (VR) technology to engage fans and attract new audiences.Tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Samsung (KS:005930) are investing heavily in VR with some predicting the immersive technology will have the same effect on television as the internet on newspapers.The concept of a virtual race, with gamers challenging drivers in an ePrix for points and prize money, was mooted by Agag even before the first Formula E season in 2014.""I think this is probably an experiment,"" he said of the Vegas race. ""Depending on how it goes I could envisage that some of these virtual races could give points for a championship in the future, but not now.""The Spaniard has talked also about fans one day being able to use VR to race against drivers competing on the physical racetrack but that day is still some way off.""The problem of that, and we’ve been really looking into that a lot, is the lag between the real race and the virtual experience you can provide the gamers,"" he said.""It’s very difficult, because of the technology and the speed of the broadband, to have drivers racing at the same time in the race which is what we would have dreamt of when we started Formula E.""On the other hand, there are many other things that are now becoming possible -- like this e-race.""Formula E cars make little noise, are far slower than Formula One and cannot yet complete a race without drivers changing cars due to the limitations of battery technology.However, major manufacturers such as Audi,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Citroen are involved.British entrepreneur Richard Branson predicted a year ago that electric racing would overtake Formula One in popularity within five years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1053,"Jun 06, 2016 02:10AM ET",Spain's auto-pilot economy flies high above political turmoil,nan,"By Blanca RodríguezJABUGO, Spain (Reuters) - In Spain's cured ham capital, the small southern village of Jabugo, uncertainty over who will govern next in Madrid is a remote concern for investors keen to produce more of the Andalusian delicacy.Drawn by the export potential for premium ham, family-owned meat producer ElPozo is pouring 70 million euros ($78.38 million) into building a new processing plant in the area even as Spain enters its sixth month without a new government and gears up for a repeat election on June 26.It is far from alone.In part thanks to Spain taking Germany-inspired austerity medicine and dealing with its banking crisis earlier than many European peers, company investments have chugged along since an inconclusive December ballot.Even now, with opinion polls projecting a similarly fragmented result and raising fears of a paralysis that could jeopardise Spain's recovery from a painful double-dip recession, local and foreign firms are finding reasons to expand, from the country's relatively low wages to recovering household spending.French carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) separately confirmed in May they would be ploughing a combined 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) into their Spanish plants over the next four years and the two will produce new models there.The economy grew 0.8 percent between January and March for the third straight quarter, one of the fastest rates in the euro zone, as both consumers and businesses shrugged off politicians' failure to strike a coalition deal.In ElPozo's case, surging Chinese demand for Spanish pork and high-quality cured ham is an opportunity it is loathe to pass on. Spain's meat exports are thriving, having jumped 16 percent last year to nearly 2 million tonnes.""We want to inundate the world with Iberian ham,"" said Rafael Fuertes, one of the senior managers at ElPozo.The firm already derives about 15 percent of its revenue from exports and is seeking to make a push in Latin America as well as Asia.Its plant in Jabugo, first mooted in 2011, aims to produce 2.5 million sausages, hams and other types of cold cuts a year, after the firm more than trebled its early production targets and increased by 50 percent its investment budget last year.Premium products will include cured legs of Iberico ham, produced from pigs fed on acorns from oak trees and hung out to dry in traditional ventilated cellars for months.LOCAL SAFETY NETFor ElPozo and many other firms, support from local authorities has provided an extra safety net as parties on the left and right jostle for power in Madrid.Spain's 17 highly-devolved regions, whose stretched finances drew international concern at the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2012, argue they are now a source of institutional stability.They boast of their own parliaments, budgets and local subsidy schemes, while even small municipalities can help get projects moving.ElPozo's plant in Jabugo is due to start taking shape later this year and should create about 70 permanent jobs in this village of some 2,400 people.""Here nobody is worried about whether there is a national government or not,"" said Jabugo Mayor Jose Luis Ramos of the Socialist party, who has been in the job for the past 15 years.DEALBREAKERS?The economy has plenty of momentum, with companies going through with investment plans hatched before the last election, but it cannot continue on auto-pilot indefinitely and there are already signs that the momentum has begun to slow.If the next election fails to quickly break the political impasse, and ushers in another round of inconclusive negotiations, the uncertainty could yet have a more marked impact on companies' ambitions.Spain's trade tailwinds could also fade.""Higher oil prices could now start working in the other direction,"" said Gizem Kara, senior euro zone economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). ""Exports are also not doing so well, due to a slowdown in emerging markets, compounded by the impact of the stronger euro. This is likely to weigh on investment growth.""Industrial spending on equipment and machinery slowed slightly in the first three months of the year, growing 1.3 percent on a quarterly basis compared to 1.9 percent previously, while the construction sector registered a contraction as a result of infrastructure tenders drying up.Already in May, surveys pointed to waning growth in Spanish factory orders, while the latest consumer and business sentiment indicators are mixed, at a time when uncertainty over the direction of policies still lingers.Parties such as the left-wing Socialists or anti-austerity Podemos (""We can"") - which placed second and third in the December vote, behind the centre-right People's Party (PP) - have for instance called for a rollback of labour laws introduced in 2012 which lessened firms' firing costs and made it easier for them to lower salaries.Yet even changes such as these may not be dealbreakers as long as domestic demand holds up or firms succeed in finding new export avenues.For ElPozo, Jabugo also had its own peculiar allure, even if it will be joining more than 20 other producers there.Nestled in the hills of the Huelva province, where extensive oak woods provide an ideal feeding ground for pigs, the village is famed for a micro-climate that creates the optimal conditions for curing meat.""We have a long term vision, we're not risk capital investors,"" ElPozo's Fuertes said.(Additional reporting and writing by Sarah White; Editing by Julien Toyer)"

1065,"May 18, 2016 09:16AM ET",Suzuki says it used wrong fuel economy tests in Japan,nan,"By Minami FunakoshiTOKYO (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) used the wrong methods to test the fuel economy of its cars in Japan, it said on Wednesday, widening a testing scandal that has already rocked smaller rival Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211).Japan's transport ministry ordered widespread checks to industry methods after Mitsubishi Motors admitted last month it manipulated fuel economy data for at least four mini-vehicle models, overstating their efficiency.Mitsubishi Motors' president, Tetsuro Aikawa, said on Wednesday he would step down over that scandal, becoming the first senior departure since it broke, battering the company's reputation and wiping billions off its market value.Worries over similar damage for Suzuki sent shares in Japan's fourth-largest carmaker down as much as 15 percent during the day. Suzuki said it would continue selling its mini-cars and saw no impact on its earnings. The correct readings, it said, were not significantly different to those it submitted.Japanese authorities, however, have asked for further details from Suzuki before May 31, calling its use of non-compliant tests ""outrageous"".""The company apologizes for the fact that we did not follow rules set by the country,"" CEO Osamu Suzuki told reporters, adding 2.1 million vehicles were affected.The company denied using the tests to make its fuel economy data look better. It blamed the decision to cobble together readings from individual car parts - rather than a single reading - on its windy testing location on a coastal hill that made readings erratic. The individual parts were tested indoors, it said.Suzuki specializes in mini-vehicles, which have engines of up to 660cc and get preferential tax treatment under Japanese law. It has roughly a third of the country's mini-vehicle market. It also has a successful Indian subsidiary, Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI).MITSUBISHI'S WOESThe transport ministry, which had asked all automakers operating in Japan to re-submit fuel economy readings on all models by Wednesday, said no other carmakers had manipulated data or used improper tests.It is still awaiting further detail, however, from Suzuki. It said it has yet to decide whether to penalize Mitsubishi Motors and, if so, by how much.Mitsubishi Motors' admission that it cheated on the fuel economy tests is its third major scandal in under two decades, and has prompted the automaker to agree to sell a one-third controlling stake to Nissan Motor Co (T:7201).At a press conference on Wednesday, Mitsubishi Motors blamed excessive pressure, less time spent on research and development and high expectations for fuel efficiency. ""There was no direct order from top management,"" CEO Osamu Masuko said. ""But top management did not have a firm grasp on the proceedings at the R&D department."" He said there were several chances for the company to stop its workers - but it did not.Masuko, who has been at the helm of Mitsubishi Motors since 2005, has been named by Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn as Mitsubishi Motors' ""pilot"". UNDER SCRUTINYEmissions and fuel economy have come under increasing scrutiny from regulators globally after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted last year it used ""defeat devices"" on 11 million diesel vehicles to lower emissions during tests.France, which ordered tests on a random sample of about 100 diesel cars last year, has said some vehicles made by  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), VW, PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), Nissan, Opel (N:GM) and Ford (N:F) failed to comply fully with its emissions regulations.South Korea, which has tested 20 diesel vehicle models, said on Monday it would punish Nissan with a fine and a recall of its Qashqai diesel sport utility vehicles, accusing it of manipulating emissions. Nissan denied the allegation.In the United States, the Justice Department is investigating  Daimler , the maker of Mercedes vehicles, over emissions testing.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

They have dominated the sport since the V6 turbo hybrid power units replaced the V8s in 2014.Monaco, the slowest of street circuits with its tight and twisty layout, is next up with outright power less important than driveability.Until Barcelona, Red Bull had considered that classic race their best chance of winning this season.""If we can find a few tenths on the power unit side, it's certainly going to be gratefully received,"" said Horner, when asked whether Renault might bring the upgrade forward for Monaco.""Let's see how the test goes but if there was any opportunity to be even more competitive in Monaco we'd take it.

1072,"May 12, 2016 07:34AM ET",Nissan buying $2.2 billion controlling stake in scandal-hit Mitsubishi Motors,nan,"By Maki Shiraki and Naomi TajitsuYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co has agreed to buy a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp, taking de facto control with a $2.2 billion bet that bails out its smaller, scandal-hit rival.The deal is a lifeline for Mitsubishi Motors, which is mired in its third scandal in two decades and has had $3 billion wiped off its market value after confessing to manipulating fuel economy data.But it should also be a boost for Nissan. Japan's second-largest car maker has struggled to make inroads into Southeast Asia, in countries like Thailand and the Philippines, where Mitsubishi's models are popular.Mitsubishi and Nissan already cooperate on development and manufacturing with a partnership dating back to 2011, but that deal does not currently involve any cross-shareholding. Under Thursday's deal, Mitsubishi Motors will issue new shares to Nissan at a 5.3 percent discount to Wednesday's close, raising 237.4 billion yen ($2.18 billion). That will hand Nissan just over a third of the group - enough to wield control, under Japanese shareholding rules.Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said the two would now share and jointly develop technology, and could realize ""billions"" in synergies by coordinating purchasing, plant utilization and cooperating in growth markets. ""We are determined to preserve and nurture the Mitsubishi Motors brand. We will help this company address the challenges it faces, particularly in restoring consumer trust in its fuel economy performance,"" Ghosn said, addressing a joint press conference in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.Nissan will be able to nominate a third of Mitsubishi Motors' board, which Ghosn said he believed would be led by a Nissan executive - prompting industry analysts and bankers to forecast a significant reshuffle at the top.Mitsubishi Motors admitted last month it overstated the fuel economy of at least four of its models - mini cars sold in Japan, including two sold under Nissan's badge.That has badly hit the group, bruising a brand already losing market share and dragging its shares down over 40 percent as investors fretted over potential compensation costs.Ghosn said he had been ""reassured"" by Mitsubishi Motors' Chief Executive Osamu Masuko over the size and scope of the fuel economy troubles, which Masuko said had accelerated discussions.Mitsubishi Motors shares were untraded before closing up 16 percent at the daily limit. Nissan shares closed down 1.4 percent.TOUGHER TASKGhosn said improving performance in kei cars, a Japanese category of small cars, was one key reason for the deal. Indeed, Nissan will gain a leg up in Japan's small car market, where it is dwarfed by Suzuki and Toyota's Daihatsu. It will also get a lift in fast-growing Asian economies, where Mitsubishi is more readily recognized. Asia excluding China accounted for just 6.5 percent of Nissan's global retail sales in the year to the end of March.""The biggest benefit to Nissan would be Mitsubishi's presence in Southeast Asia,"" said Koji Endo, autos analyst at Advanced Research Japan. But the deal also leaves Nissan with a much tougher task: ensuring a turnaround at Mitsubishi, without full control.""Taking a one-third stake feels a bit like a half-measure,"" said Kiyoshi Yamanaka at T&D Asset Management.""For investors, it would be cleaner if they made Mitsubishi Motors a fully owned subsidiary, as Toyota did with Daihatsu, and then took firm control of righting its governance."" An industry banker familiar with the deal dampened expectations of a full takeover. Sister companies in the sprawling Mitsubishi family are unlikely to sell, he said.Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Mitsubishi Corp, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, together with subsidiaries held roughly a 34 percent stake in the automaker before the deal. That will be diluted to around 22 percent.None have yet commented on the tie-up.Group companies bailed out Mitsubishi Motors in 2004, but had not been expected to step in this time. Mitsubishi Corp reported its first ever loss this week.Mitsubishi Motors said on Wednesday it had enough cash to weather the fuel-economy scandal - but also warned that non-compliant data may have been used to calculate the fuel economy for more of its cars than previously announced. After Mitsubishi admitted last month to manipulating fuel economy data, analysts estimated the automaker is facing up to $1 billion in compensation for its customers, along with payments to Nissan.Alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and Mitsubishi have combined sales of about 9.3 million vehicles, approaching those of industry leaders Toyota and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).""We have the potential to be in top three,"" Ghosn said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I know I'm still quick,"" said Hamilton.""I've known that since day one in testing and, when I've had clean air and a damage-free car this season, I've shown it on track.""Barcelona marks the real start of the European season, the sport's historic heartland, even if Russia preceded Spain this year for the first time.A circuit where teams test pre-season, it is both predictable and surprising -- there have been nine different winners in the last nine years yet all but two of the last 15 pole-setters have won. The paddock 'motorhomes', the palatial hospitality units used only at European races, will gleam in the sunshine with teams bringing major upgrades to the track and hoping for a change of fortunes.A good result in Spain bodes well for the rest of the year. ""Barcelona is a very good indication of where you are with the car,"" said Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, whose team are hoping for a clean weekend to show their real potential after a nightmarish string of mishaps and failures. Renault  (PA:RENA), who took their first points of the campaign in Sochi, have said already that Barcelona and the first in-season test that follows will mark the start of their real development program.""We look at this race as a marker in the sand: the exit point of our recovery from the takeover (of Lotus) and the first race as 'our' team,"" said Renault F1 managing director Cyril Abiteboul.

Racing director Frederic Vasseur told reporters in Russia that Renault, who had Magnussen and Britain's Jolyon Palmer 17th and 18th on the starting grid in Sochi, had to improve their qualifying performance.French reserve driver Esteban Ocon will take Palmer's place in first practice next Friday and also take part in the first in-season test.Vasseur said however that Renault were committed to their line-up.""Kevin has performed very well in his return to Formula One and Jolyon is approaching his rookie season in a clear and methodical manner,"" he said.""It’s true that Jolyon had a couple of races where he didn’t deliver as he wanted, equally this is natural in a driver’s first season; he’s learning and making strong progress.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1077,"May 06, 2016 06:55AM ET",Pakistan woos Renault-Nissan in push for auto investment,nan,"By Drazen JorgicISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan is wooing foreign car makers like Renault-Nissan with generous import duties, but convincing them to set up factories will be an uphill challenge given fears about the country's long-term political stability and security.Pakistan wants to shake up its Japanese-dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki, whose locally assembled cars are sold at relatively high prices but lag behind imported vehicles in terms of quality and specifications.To do that, analysts say, the government must convince manufacturers that the country has turned a corner after a decade of economic turbulence and a series of major attacks by Islamist militant groups including the Taliban.With the economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years, the local currency stable against the dollar and interest rates at their lowest in 42 years, Pakistani officials believe the country is once again on the radar of investors seeking to tap into a market of nearly 200 million people.Officials are touting a new auto policy, skewed in favor of new entrants, that includes offering foreign car manufacturers lower duties as an incentive to set up plants in Pakistan or revive shuttered ones.""We expect that there will be one or two foreign investors coming into Pakistan,"" said Miftah Ismail, chairman of Pakistan's Board of Investment, who has been talking to car makers about setting up assembly plants for the local market.Ismail told Reuters he had held talks with Japan's Nissan (T:7201) and alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) for ""some time"", and last month met  Fiat  (MI:FCHA) executives in Italy for the first time.Previous discussions also involved Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).""I hope some people will bite,"" he said.A source close to Renault said Pakistan was under consideration for new production investment, along with other potential locations, but added that discussions were at a very early stage. In an e-mailed statement, the company said it had ""no news to announce at this time"".Nissan chief spokesman Jonathan Adashek said: ""Pakistan is certainly a market of interest for us at present"", but added no final decision had been made.STABILITYAnalysts say the odds are stacked against Pakistan finalizing deals, despite the concessions on offer.A major obstacle is the perennial concern about political stability in a country where the military has staged several coups since independence and attempted others.The threat of militant attacks also remains high, despite the armed forces' long-running campaign against groups including the Taliban who are opposed to the government in Islamabad.Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest large sums when the long-term outlook is so uncertain.""There is potential in Pakistan. There is no doubt about that,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at consultant IHS Automotive. ""(But) we really don't feel Pakistan is in a relatively stable condition, from a mid to long-term perspective.""Another possible turn off for investors is the size of Pakistan's car market, where 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. That compares with more than 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighboring India.""The Pakistan market is not big enough,"" said Mumshad Ali, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts.He added that the government's new policies were probably not bold enough to tempt new manufacturers, nor did they address ways to increase demand, such as lowering sales taxes.The local manufacturing partners of Toyota and Honda did not respond to requests for comment.Ali said existing manufacturers felt aggrieved that the government was favoring new investors, and believed they should be similarly encouraged to build new plants and expand existing facilities.Suzuki on Friday said it was prepared to invest $460 million in Pakistan, including setting up a new plant, if the government provided the right incentives.It called for changes to the new auto policy, which it said ""may damage the tremendous investment potential in the Pakistan automobile sector"".Ismail said new entrants would be able to import machinery for plants duty free. Customs duty for importing car parts has been set at 10 percent, while existing players will have to pay 30 percent.""We want greater competition, and we expect with greater competition consumers will be offered better choices,"" he said.Some Pakistanis are frustrated by high prices and the quality of locally produced cars, which tend not to have airbags, anti-lock breaking systems (ABS) and other features considered standard elsewhere.The cheapest Pakistani car, the Suzuki Mehran, sells for 650,000 Pakistani rupee ($6,200), or about double the price of a comparable model in India.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I am very positive also for next year,"" the teenager told Reuters in March.""I am very happy with Red Bull, I know what the perspective is for next year and the years after,"" he added. ""Happy to be at Toro Rosso for the moment and to learn more. Then we’ll see next year where we are.""Germany's Sebastian Vettel, who won four successive world championships with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013 and is now at Ferrari, made his debut for BMW-Sauber as a stand-in at the 2007 U.S. Grand Prix.Red Bull, who had Vettel under contract as a junior driver, promptly drafted him in to the Toro Rosso race lineup to make sure he stayed in the fold.By moving Verstappen up now, after just four races, Red Bull can measure him against Daniel Ricciardo before making a firm decision on 2017.They can also get the teen fully acclimatized before getting an upgraded  Renault  (PA:RENA) engine in Canada next month that should make them more competitive. Kvyat made his debut with Toro Rosso in 2014 and graduated to Red Bull after just one season, almost by default, when Vettel announced he was leaving.The Russian, 22, has plenty of admirers for his race craft and attitude but has struggled to rise to the challenge. He qualified 18th in Australia this year, and did not start, and was 15th on the grid in Bahrain.While he was third in China last month, and was named Driver of the Day, he clashed with Vettel with the German accusing him of launching himself like a Torpedo and driving like a madman.In Sochi, his home race, he collided with Vettel twice on the opening lap in a collision that also involved Red Bull team mate Ricciardo.""Sochi was obviously the final catalyst to changing Kvyat for Verstappen in a bigger picture,"" said former racer and TV commentator Martin Brundle on Twitter. ""Future contract for MV, takes tension out of MV v (Carlos) Sainz.""The late McLaren principal Teddy Mayer once said ""drivers are just interchangeable light bulbs, you plug them in and they do the job"" but even in a sport with so little sentiment Kvyat's demotion came as a shock.""Really? one bad race and Kyvat's dropped, what about the podium in the previous race? #Shortmemories,"" commented McLaren's Jenson Button on Twitter.Red Bull have shown a ruthless streak in the past, with a succession of drivers discarded, but Kvyat has at least been handed a second chance to regain some confidence at Toro Rosso. He will still have to prove himself, however.""We basically have long-term contracts at the Red Bull junior program and the whole program is based on performance,"" Red Bull's motorsport consultant Helmut Marko warned in March.""Be very clear: the one who is not delivering goes.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But the relationship unraveled after the introduction of a new V6 turbo hybrid power unit in 2014 to replace the old V8s.Mercedes were immediately established as the dominant force, while Renault's engine was both unreliable and down on performance.As 2015 wore on, senior Red Bull management became increasingly vocal about what they saw as the engine's shortcomings, while searching for a more competitive alternative.""Renault couldn't provide us with an engine that enabled us to run at the front. It's that simple,"" Red Bull motorsport consultant Helmut Marko said in September.When Mercedes and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) ruled out a supply for 2016, and McLaren vetoed any move by Honda, Red Bull faced the threat of having no engine supplier. It eventually reached a deal to continue with Renault units carrying Tag Heuer branding.The newly published regulations set out a formula under which manufacturers' would be selected to supply teams, if asked to by the FIA, and the conditions teams would have to meet.They made clear that manufacturers could not be forced to supply any team whose senior executives, directors or beneficial shareholders had committed actions that might harm their reputation.The actions included fraud, money laundering, being listed in official European Union or U.S. sanction lists, declared bankrupt or having been convicted of an indictable criminal offence.Teams must also pay 80 percent of the cost of the power units before the start of the season, with the rest due by the fifth race.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Failing which we would be compelled to legislate.""Renault had no comment on Macron's comments when contacted by Reuters.Ghosn's total 2015 payout included 1.23 million euros in fixed salary, 1.78 million in variable pay and a further 4.18 million in deferred bonuses and stock That was in addition to his second salary as CEO of 43.4 percent-owned affiliate Nissan (T:7201), which last year amounted to 8 million euros.Across the Channel in Britain, shareholders have staged a series of protest votes over what they regard as excessive pay for executives.

The French state proved decisive in the non-binding vote, a year after increasing its stake in the carmaker.In a hastily convened session afterwards, the Renault board endorsed Ghosn's payout, including 1.23 million euros in fixed salary, 1.78 million in variable pay and a further 4.18 million in deferred bonuses and stock.""The board once again acknowledges the quality of 2015 results,"" Renault said in a statement. However, it added the remunerations committee had been asked to review pay structures for 2016 and beyond.Executive pay levels are attracting renewed scrutiny at companies from HSBC to  BP  (LON:BP), where shareholders have forced a review of compensation policies. France's Socialist government, under pressure over its labor reform proposals amid soaring unemployment, has also stepped up criticism of CEO payouts.In past years, Ghosn, who also heads Japanese alliance partner Nissan, has drawn regular criticism from the French state over his pay. His additional Nissan salary for the last fiscal year will be announced in June.The government commands more than 18 percent of voting rights in Renault, or about a quarter of votes cast at the meeting. Ghosn's payout was backed by more than 60 percent of the other shareholders represented.Finance ministry officials confirmed that the state had voted against Ghosn's package.""The government has been consistent in calling for pay moderation, starting with companies under public ownership,"" said one.Before the vote, Ghosn was publicly taken to task by a representative of shareholder advisory firm Proxinvest, which had recommended that investors reject the pay package.""The board does not decide (on pay) on the basis of caprice,"" Ghosn told shareholders. ""It is the board acting on your delegated authority that decides who runs the company and the remuneration that matches their efforts and talents."" Renault shareholders separately approved agreements struck last year to end an eight-month boardroom crisis sparked by France's stake increase.The pacts struck in December limit France's increased voting rights while shielding Nissan against potential interference by Renault, which owns 43.4 percent of the Japanese carmaker.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

From 2018, the price would drop by a further three million euros.""Cost reduction on power units will be driven by changes to the sporting and technical regulations in 2017 and 2018, with a progressive reduction of the number of power unit elements per driver per season,"" the FIA said.Drivers are currently allowed five units per season, with penalties applied if they exceed their allocation.The FIA said there would be an obligation to supply all teams, a bone of contention last year when Mercedes, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Honda all ruled out providing engines to rivals Red Bull after that team fell out with  Renault  (PA:RENA).Red Bull are now using Renault units with Tag Heuer branding.Measures to reduce the performance gap, with Mercedes dominant since 2014 and newest arrivals Honda still some way off the pace, would include the removal of a system of 'tokens' limiting development during the season.($1 = 0.8737 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

If I win that title, then we see, Then I will speak about whether I can be in F1 or not. F1 is for the future."" Sirotkin will be racing in the GP2 support series again this year after finishing third overall in his debut season, ending up as the top rookie with five podium finishes including a victory at Silverstone.Formula One is the ultimate aim, however, and the Russian feels he is now in the right place to make that happen after ambitious fast-track plans with cash-strapped Sauber came to nothing.In 2013, the little-known 17-year-old was introduced as someone the Swiss team planned to bring into Formula One, possibly as early as 2014.It seemed to many onlookers that he had been brought in way too early, more out of Sauber's desire to secure funds to stay afloat rather than because they had detected a rare and precocious talent.The deal was part of a partnership with Russia’s Investment Cooperation International Fund, the State Fund of Development of the North-West Russian federation and the National Institute of Aviation Technologies headed by the driver's father Oleg.BETTER FUNDINGSirotkin tested for Sauber in 2014 and took part in free practice at Sochi that year, but the 2015 race seats went to drivers with better funding.""It didn't happen but maybe it's good for me because I had the chance to prove myself and make a great season in GP2,"" he said.""Now I have another opportunity to improve what we couldn't do last year and get a title and then I am back here with an absolutely different picture.""Only two Russians have raced in the Formula One world championship -- Vitaly Petrov with Renault and Caterham between 2010 and 2012 and Red Bull's current incumbent Daniil Kvyat -- but Sirotkin could be the next.He has wealthier and better-connected backers than in the past, now part of the SMP Racing project founded by billionaire Boris Rotenberg.Rotenberg and his brother Arkady control SMP Bank and are regarded as part of the inner circle of President Vladimir Putin, who has attended both previous Russian Grands Prix and is expected again in Sochi on Sunday.Russia is also an important market for Renault, with chief executive Carlos Ghosn saying in February that the country would be one of those driving the French carmaker's future growth as well as being increasingly attracted to Formula One.""SMP is the junior driver development program that covers all the stages from karting up to Formula One,"" said Sirotkin.""When they brought me here they went to another level.""So many young (Russian) kids are growing up and all of them are dreaming about F1...it's really good that we are getting close to F1 and have some open doors there.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

We've got to keep an eye on the red guys (Ferrari), they are very close as you saw today.""Ferrari enjoyed a brilliant start, with Vettel able to carve through the front-row occupying Mercedes duo on the run to the first turn.His Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen also got off to a flyer and he darted up the side to claim second place as Rosberg's rear left tire made contact with Hamilton's front wing.COMPOUND ISSUESVettel appeared poised for an unlikely win but the race turned on its head when Alonso crashed into Haas driver Esteban Gutierrez at high speed going into turn three of the 18th lap.The Spaniard's car careened into a barrier and was smashed to pieces before it flipped, rolled and flew end-over-end into another barrier.Alonso walked away from the wreckage but the red flag came out to halt the race for around 10 minutes as track staff swept away debris and repaired the barriers.During the break, Mercedes opted to run both cars on medium compound tires and rode them to the finish, while Ferrari took the more aggressive route, sticking with their super-softs, which were quicker but ultimately required another stop.The mistake proved costly and was compounded when Vettel's next tire change was botched, while Raikkonen's race was over on lap 23 when an engine failure forced him out and he reached the pits with flames shooting out of the top of his car.""Obviously the red flag didn't help us,"" Vettel said.""We went for the aggressive route but maybe with hindsight we may have gone with something else,"" the German added of the tire strategy.New team Haas, the first American-owned F1 outfit to race in 30 years, celebrated points on debut, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean finishing sixth behind Red Bull's fourth-placed Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa in a Williams.Force India's Nico Hulkenberg, Williams' Valtteri Bottas, and the Toro Rosso duo of Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen completed the top 10, with  Renault  (PA:RENA) rookie Jolyon Palmer narrowly missing out on a point on debut.Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat was among six cars that failed to finish including Manor Racing's Indonesian rookie Rio Haryanto.Haryanto's team mate and fellow debutant Pascal Wehrlein was last of the 16 finishers.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I didn't think it was very exciting.""And in the end for the people in the grandstands, I don't feel it's the right way to go.""STATUS QUO REMAINSIronically, the new format saw little change in Formula One's status quo, with no major surprises in the top eight positions.Max Verstappen will line up fifth for Toro Rosso, with his team mate Carlos Sainz seventh behind Williams's Felipe Massa.Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo will line up eighth on the grid as the first eliminated from Q3.

The car performed well and I was lucky to get a couple of dry laps,"" Hamilton told reporters.""Hopefully it'll be dry tomorrow, so we can give something back to the fans who braved the weather.""Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was second quickest in the later session, nearly half a second adrift of Hamilton, with Ferrari's former world champion Kimi Raikkonen third.RED BULLS SHOW PROMISERosberg, who won the final three races of last season, had a day to forget.Sixth fastest in the opening session, he skidded at turn six in the second run and damaged his front wing in a collision with the barrier.The German rolled slowly around the track for a few moments before being called to stop, as Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff glared at a television screen in the garage.Red Bull had a better day, with Kvyat's Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo third behind the Russian in the initial run and fourth-quickest later on.""With the conditions like that and going into an interesting qualifying format tomorrow, it could be an opportunity for us,"" Ricciardo said.""Hopefully we can sneak up a couple of rows further up than we could in dry conditions.""McLaren also had reason for cheer, with drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button posting the sixth and seventh fastest times in second practice, just over a second off Hamilton's pace. Four-times champion Sebastian Vettel, tipped to threaten Hamilton's ambitions of a fourth title overall, was eighth quickest in the second session after failing to post a time in the first as gusty winds buffeted the street circuit all day.Seven drivers, including all from  Renault  (PA:RENA), Williams and Sauber, did not trouble the timers in FP2, with teams seeing little value in testing the car in the wet.New team Haas, the first U.S.-owned F1 outfit in 30 years, had a cautious debut with French driver Romain Grosjean and Esteban Gutierrez posting slow times in both sessions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1101,"Mar 16, 2016 03:20AM ET",Party over for Hamilton as new season dawns,nan,"By Ian RansomMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton spent the off-season crisscrossing the globe to party with A-list celebrities but Formula One's reigning champion is adamant there will be no hangover when he returns to work at this week's season-opening Australian Grand Prix.The clear bookmakers' favorite to win a third successive title with Mercedes, Hamilton will arrive in Melbourne after a whirlwind trip to New Zealand where he took to the skies in a helicopter on Wednesday above the mountain resort of Queenstown.Hamilton's frequent flying and party lifestyle prompted some pundits to voice concerns about his focus and energy levels in the leadup to Sunday's race at Albert Park.However, the 31-year-old says his competitive drive remains as sharp as ever and his feet will be firmly on the ground once he enters the paddock.""I know there's still more to come from me -- I think I've shown that in the past two years,"" Hamilton, winner in Australia last year and in 2008, said this week.""There certainly needs to be some extra in my tank, as the competition will be stronger than ever this year.""Many invested in motor sport's pinnacle series will hope Hamilton is right about the level of competition he expects to face this season.Another win in Melbourne from pole position for the Briton could add more voices to the growing weariness of the Silver Arrows' dominance.The constructors champions are bullish about their car after near-flawless pre-season testing, however, and team mate Nico Rosberg may again loom as Hamilton's stiffest competition in Melbourne.While Hamilton has been living life like there is no tomorrow, there is also a sense that time is running out for his German rival, whose Mercedes contract expires at the end of the season.After Hamilton wrapped up his third title in Texas last year, Rosberg closed out the season with three successive wins, and at Albert Park he will hope to prove the late flourish owed more to his racing than a dip in his team mate's motivation.RULE CHANGESFerrari (NYSE:RACE), fired by four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, were the only team to deny the Mercedes' drivers a sweep of race wins last year and the new SF16-H car showed impressive speed during testing.With only 11 cars finishing last year's season-opener in Melbourne, however, reliability will be paramount and that quality alone may be enough to score points.F1 bosses will hope Melbourne can lift the off-season gloom that has hung over a series which drivers have criticized for being over-complicated by rule changes and which commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone said he would not even bother taking his family to see.A positive start by Haas, the first U.S.-owned outfit in 30 years, would help, and the new team will look to upstage more seasoned rivals like Sauber, who have the same Ferrari engine.Indonesia's first F1 driver Rio Haryanto will also add a novelty factor when he debuts for Manor Racing.He is among three rookies set to make their race debuts, along with German team mate Pascal Wehrlein and Britain's Jolyon Palmer at  Renault  (PA:RENA).Along with the new drivers, F1's governing body will feel some butterflies with the debut of a new qualifying format which sees drivers progressively eliminated during the three phases rather than knocked out at the end of each of them.Introduced to make F1 more exciting but approved less than two weeks ago, the new format has been slammed by drivers.""I'm personally not a fan ... and I think, speaking on behalf of all the drivers, no driver is,"" Vettel told Sky Sport.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1102,"Mar 15, 2016 03:10PM ET",New boss of Russian carmaker Avtovaz enters a lion's den,nan,"By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack StubbsMOSCOW (Reuters) - Nicolas Maure, brought in to turn around Renault-Nissan's Russian carmaker Avtovaz, is entering a lion's den where his predecessor fell foul of diving sales and powerful vested interests among shareholders, suppliers and workers.The 55-year-old Frenchman is likely to press on with cutting the workforce and weeding out shoddy component suppliers, albeit at a slower place than the last chief, while fending off those who want to keep the status quo. Avtovaz, producer of Russia's best-selling Lada brand and the country's biggest automaker by sales, is deeply troubled.Maure was named chief executive on Tuesday to replace Swedish national Bo Andersson, who fell victim to Russia's economic slump which hurt car sales, and came under fire from Avotvaz's Russian shareholders who criticized him for laying off workers.Until now, Maure has been running Renault's (PA:REN) Romanian business Dacia, giving him experience of working in a former Communist bloc state and dealing with prickly unions. But the problems he will encounter at Avtovaz's Togliatti plant on the Volga river are on a different scale.One manager has been shot dead since the collapse of communism in Russia - an incident linked to organized crime which at times has infected the auto industry - and in the past few years some senior staff at the plant have gone around Togliatti with bodyguards.Maure's appointment was announced by Avtovaz's main shareholders, the Renault-Nissan alliance and Russian state-owned Rostec, confirming an earlier Reuters report.""Avtovaz has modernised its line-up and manufacturing processes, and significantly improved product quality,"" said Carlos Ghosn, who heads the Franco-Japanese alliance and is Avtovaz chairman. ""We remain bullish about the long-term future of the Russian market and Avtovaz as the leading domestic automaker.""MINIATURE CARSRenault-Nissan owns a combined 67 percent of the holding company that controls Avtovaz while Rostec, a defense conglomerate, owns the remaining 33 percent.Maure is a 16-year veteran of  Renault  (PA:RENA) who decorated his office in Romania with large numbers of miniature cars. In his job as president and CEO of Automobile Dacia SA, he handled tough wage negotiations, with unions threatening to strike.Management raised the prospect that production could move to Renault's more competitive plant in the Moroccan city of Tangiers if wages in Romania rose too much. In the end, the two sides settled on a 5 percent wage rise and bonus for 2016.Nevertheless, the Dacia business is growing. By contrast, Avtovaz has been hammered by the Russian economic crisis caused by low oil prices and Western sanctions.Avtovaz reported a net loss of 73.85 billion roubles ($999.3 million) for 2015, almost triple the 2014 loss, and issued a plea for cash to shareholders. Renault wrote down the value of its investment in the firm by 70 percent.Lada is also being challenged by South Korean rivals Kia and Hyundai which make cars in a similar price range and, as foreign brands, are preferred by some status-conscious Russians.NO WORK IN TOGLIATTIAndersson responded by slashing jobs. In 2014 and 2015, the company made 20,000 of its 65,000 employees redundant. That has badly hurt life in Togliatti, a city dominated by Avtovaz and its suppliers.""All the employers have fired people, the streets are full of people, and there's no work in Togliatti,"" said Yevgeny, a 49-year-old procurement specialist who lost his job at Avtovaz and was queuing earlier this month to register at a state employment office.The job cuts are a sensitive issue for the Kremlin, which is worried about social unrest stemming from the economic slump.Rostec boss Sergei Chemezov, a former colleague of President Vladimir Putin, castigated the Avtovaz management in November. ""They threw people out into the street,"" he was quoted as saying by TASS news agency. ""This is probably a European practice; we believe you can't do that, you need to behave more flexibly.""Vladimir Bespalov, an auto industry analyst with VTB Capital, said Avtovaz under its new management would now steer clear of large-scale compulsory redundancies.""Avtovaz will continue to reduce employee numbers, but it's unlikely they'll fire people,"" Bespalov said. ""Probably they will leave in force the ban on hiring new staff.""GUN TO MY HEADUnder Andersson, the firm made headway in cleaning up a supplier network once rife with corruption and inefficiency. He scrapped contracts with some long-standing local suppliers, causing them in turn to lay off workers.Commenting on a dispute with suppliers in January, Andersson was quoted as saying by the RBC news agency: ""I will not let them hold a gun to my head."" That stance led to a backlash from influential Russian interests, with government officials speaking out in defense of the homegrown suppliers.A manager at a separate Russian automaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one of the main reasons Andersson was removed was because he was uncompromising with Russian suppliers, replacing them with foreign contractors at the first sign of problems with the quality of their parts.""An important task facing the new head of Avtovaz is to preserve the remaining Russian suppliers,"" said the manager.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1103,"Mar 11, 2016 08:50AM ET",Red Bull get their warnings in early,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Red Bull have added to the pre-season pressure on their four Formula One drivers with a sharp reminder that they have to live up to expectations to keep their seats.Helmut Marko, motorsport consultant for Red Bull's Austrian owner Dietrich Mateschitz, also told the official formula1.com website on Friday that former champions Red Bull Racing needed a competitive engine if they were to stay in the sport.""We basically have long-term contracts at the Red Bull junior program and the whole program is based on performance. So no shoot-out, but be very clear: the one who is not delivering goes,"" Marko said.Red Bull Racing have Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Russian Daniil Kvyat in an unchanged 2016 lineup while sister team Toro Rosso have 18-year-old Dutch driver Max Verstappen and 21-year-old Spaniard Carlos Sainz.Both youngsters made a big impression in their 2015 rookie season, with Verstappen the sport's youngest ever driver and points scorer. The new season starts in Melbourne next week.Toro Rosso serves as a feeder team for Red Bull, with both Ricciardo and Kvyat graduating from there as did four times world champion Sebastian Vettel who is now at Ferrari (NYSE:RACE).But for every success story, there have been plenty of others whose Formula One careers have ended prematurely after Toro Rosso tossed them aside.Verstappen is seen as a champion of the future while Ricciardo is a race-winner who has become one of the sport's most popular drivers.""Let’s see what he delivers. The second season is sometimes trickier than the first,"" Marko said of Verstappen.The Austrian, a former racer himself, issued repeated warnings last year about Red Bull's commitment to the sport after they fell out with  Renault  (PA:RENA) and searched in vain for a competitive alternative.They ended up with a Renault engine branded as Tag Heuer, with the luxury watch maker joining as a partner, but Marko suggested that might be a stopgap. Toro Rosso have 2015-specification Ferrari power units.""Mr Mateschitz has said many times that we are not in Formula One just to participate, we are here to win. The Olympic principle of just being there is not in Red Bull’s DNA,"" said Marko.""The Concorde Agreement goes until 2020. But to stay that long we must have a competitive engine in the very near future,"" he added referring to the confidential commercial agreement between teams and rights holder.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

I am very positive also for next year,"" he told Reuters ahead of the Australian season-opener in Australia on March 20.""I am very happy with Red Bull, I know what the perspective is for next year and the years after,"" he added. ""Happy to be at Toro Rosso for the moment and to learn more. Then we’ll see next year where we are.""Verstappen was snapped up by Red Bull at the age of 16, making his F1 race debut at the age of 17 and 166 days and then scoring points in his second race in Malaysia when he finished seventh after qualifying sixth.So precocious was he, and so alarmed were some within the sport, that the governing FIA changed the rules to prevent anyone else under 18 from acquiring a superlicence.The same International Automobile Federation then presented Verstappen with awards for Rookie of the Year, Personality of the Year and Action of the Year at their end-of-season gala prize-giving.IMMEDIATE LOYALTYVerstappen, whose best result last year was fourth, made clear that his immediate loyalty was to Red Bull for taking a leap of faith in him.Asked whether he could see himself staying ""in the family"", he replied: ""Yes, first of all I think it’s something you have to be loyal to someone and I think especially to Red Bull.""They gave the chance to let me drive in Formula One at such a young age already, they have been a great help and support. So for me at the moment there is no reason to change. So far I am very happy.""""I'm definitely looking forward to this year, to do a good job, but also to next year. I’m still very young. I don’t think I need to rush now.""Toro Rosso have switched from Renault's V6 turbo hybrid to 2015-specification Ferrari engines that cannot be developed further.The Ferrari was some way ahead of  Renault  (PA:RENA) at the end of last season, which should mean Toro Rosso are at least competitive in the early races of 2016 -- and maybe ahead of Red Bull with their Tag Heuer-badged Renault engine.""For us it (the first half of the season) is the most important, because we have the 2015 engine so we can’t develop the engine as the people can with the 2016 engine,"" said Verstappen.Last year the son of former racer Jos was the center of attention in testing, a youngster who some suspected might be out of his depth but who swiftly showed how much at home he was in a paddock he first entered as a toddler.It feels very different now.""Last year I was sitting here and you knew you were in Formula One but you didn’t really know how to go into test days,"" he recalled.""Now you know what is coming. And you are a bit more relaxed about it, you settle in a bit more. ""You know the team, everyone in it. You know the people you are close to and working with, you already have this relationship from last year.""I don’t really feel the pressure to do better or be at the same level,"" he said.""I just go in it and we’ll see what happens.

Team mate Nico Rosberg is 3/1 and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel 4/1.Nobody else comes close in the bookmakers' estimation. Vettel's Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 champion who turns 37 in October and could be racing his farewell season, is only 40/1.However, there are grounds to suggest things may pan out differently once the racing starts at Melbourne's Albert Park next week.Rosberg, runner-up for the past two seasons but winner of the last three races of 2015 from pole position, has a point to prove and could be on the cusp of something remarkable if he can pick up where he left off in Abu Dhabi last November.Vettel, who won four titles in a row with Red Bull before Hamilton dethroned him in 2014, will want to deny the Briton the satisfaction of equaling his tally and becoming only the fifth quadruple champion.Both Germans have pounded out the laps in pre-season testing in Barcelona, with Mercedes the most reliable car and Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) setting the more eye-catching times.While there are plenty in the paddock who suspect Mercedes could be even more dominant, and maybe embarrassingly quick in Australia, nobody knows for sure just where they stand in relation to each other.SUPER JOB""We have tried to close the gap,"" Vettel, who won his four titles with Red Bull, told the formula1.com website. ""It was pretty big in recent years.""We did a super job last season that brought us closer and now the new car gives us the chance to close the gap even more. How much? We will have to wait at least a couple of weeks,"" added the 28-year-old.Mercedes have triumphed in 32 of the last 38 grands prix, and only two drivers from outside the 'Silver Arrows' have finished on top of the podium since 2013. Vettel is one of them.The German won three grands prix for Ferrari last year, the target the team had set after a barren 2014, and is now aiming to compete for the title all the way down to the final race..""They have been very quick for sure,"" said Rosberg of Ferrari's pace. ""We know more or less where we are compared to Ferrari, which is why I say for sure it is close. But we are not sure if we are ahead or behind.""The best of the rest is likely to be a battle between Williams, third for the past two years, and Red Bull while former champions McLaren try to haul themselves back up the pecking order after slumping to ninth in 2015. [L5N16G3TT] Renault  (PA:RENA) are back as a full constructor, taking over struggling Lotus, while Marussia have become Manor and the Haas team are set to make their debut as the first U.S.-owned outfit for 30 years.Azerbaijan debuts with a race in Baku in June, and Germany returns after a year's absence, but the fate of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza after 2016 remains up in the air pending negotiations.Three rookies are set to make their race debuts -- Britain's Jolyon Palmer at Renault, Pascal Wehrlein at Manor and the German's team mate Rio Haryanto who will become the first Indonesian to start a grand prix.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Is it going to be with Haas one day? Is it going to be with another team?

1108,"Mar 07, 2016 03:40PM ET","Microsoft takes on Oracle, opening up database software to Linux",nan,"By Sarah McBrideSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) planned on Monday to announce its move into a new business, unveiling a database software that works with a rival to its Windows operating system, a move that takes aim at a market long dominated by  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL). Microsoft's new database product will work with the Linux operating system. The move is the latest to show Microsoft’s increasing willingness to work with competing products, a radical change for the once fiercely protective company.Microsoft's more open strategy has become a hallmark of Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella since he took over in 2014.In an era of exploding amounts of data, much of it used by companies trying to win more business and establish competitive edges, data management has become critically important.Overall database-software sales, well north of $30 billion, have kept rising even though spending in information technology has been generally lackluster, said Gartner analyst Merv Adrian.“If you look at the companies that are transforming and disrupting industries, it is often with data at the core,” said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft. “All of them are using data in a much richer way now to understand their customers.”He cited electronic signature company DocuSign as a longstanding customer of SQL Server, the database product that is expanding to Linux. So is  Renault  (PA:RENA) Sport, which uses sensors that collect myriad data points to hone performance of Formula One racing teams. Microsoft’s SQL Server business ranks behind No. 1 Oracle, which has more than 40 percent market share in database software and works with Linux, Adrian said.Microsoft has 21.5 percent of the market, he said, pushing International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) from second to third place in 2013. The product is one of Microsoft’s biggest business lines. SAP SE (DE:SAPG) also competes in the area.Until now, Microsoft on-premises database software worked only with its own Windows operating system. Now it will work with Linux, which has gained significant traction in recent years. “Larry’s not going to lose any sleep,” said Adrian, referring to Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, “but yes, they’ll notice it. It’s a significant competitive threat they didn’t have before.”It was unclear how many customers Microsoft will win for its Linux product, which will be in preview mode until mid 2017.Under Nadella, Microsoft has made many products compatible with other systems, including Apple’s iOS. Late last year, it opened its cloud service, Azure, to customers of Red Hat (N:RHT), a company that makes a popular version of Linux.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1109,"Mar 06, 2016 07:30AM ET",Daimler CEO says digital mapping consortium in expansion talks,nan,"By Ilona WissenbachESTORIL, Portugal (Reuters) - Daimler's Chief Executive (DE:DAIGn) told Reuters that a German auto maker consortium which controls the HERE digital mapping business is in talks with potential new members.In August last year, German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG), Audi (DE:VOWG_p) and Mercedes (DE:DAIGn), agreed to pay 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) to buy Nokia's high definition maps business (HE:NOKIA), in a step to develop self-driving cars. The deal closed in December and the German auto makers Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW started negotiations with new potential members, Zetsche said in an interview embargoed for Sunday.""If there are individual companies that are already raising their finger, then this is fast and pleasing. I do not think it will take very long until the first company gives a binding commitment to join,"" Zetsche said at a Mercedes-Benz driving event in Portugal.The HERE mapping business needs additional investments to make it viable for use as a navigation tool for self-driving cars. Having more carmakers join the consortium will potentially spread the cost across more members and could improve the volume of live traffic information being fed to the map from vehicles on the road. Last week carmakers Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA), and supplier Continental (DE:CONG) said they were considering taking a stake in the HERE mapping consortium. Intelligent mapping systems like HERE's are the basis on which self-driving cars, linked to wireless networks, can perform functions such as recalculating a route to the nearest electric charging station or around a traffic jam or accident.Talks with third parties only started in the past two months because the consortium waited until the deal closed before talking to other partners, Zetsche said. Having only three members in the consortium made negotiations to close the deal simpler, Zetsche said.""Interest will not only be limited to Renault-Nissan and Continental,"" Zetsche added.Self-driving and connected car services could become a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) have estimated. Germany's carmakers decided to club together to bid for the asset to accelerate plans for self-driving cars after Internet rival Alphabet (O:GOOGL) unveiled a prototype autonomous vehicle.Now  Daimler  is ready to expand the business which will form the basis for interactive maps which include live data on traffic flows gathered by thousands of sensors on BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. ""It is clear that we want to aggressively expand this platform, we will make the means available to do this,"" Zetsche said.There are talks with the telecommunications industry about how to spread the availability of ultra-high-speed 5G networks, Zetsche said.Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi are also evaluating whether their cooperation on maps can be broadened, Zetsche said. ""When it concerns navigation, we have broadly identical needs. Setting communication standards, which language we should speak and what signals we send, we can decide together,"" Zetsche said. Daimler is on the lookout for software and information technology specialists to help develop its digital businesses, including through further takeovers.""To get access to the right resources we will continue making acquisitions,"" Zetsche said, explaining that there are currently no live talks for a deal. Daimler has already bought the MyTaxi App and any further deals will be about buying smaller companies, Zetsche said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The two companies expect to start implementing the cost-saving plan on April 1.Since its 1999 rescue by Renault, Nissan has outgrown its French parent and now leads the way in engineering and other key areas, within an alliance now ranked as the world's fourth-largest carmaker by combined sales.The alliance drew a line under an eight-month power struggle with the French government in December, with a compromise deal balancing increased state influence at Renault with weakened control over its Japanese affiliate.($1 = 0.9107 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In Europe, a recent bright spot for many manufacturers, orders remain robust.Volvo, which sells trucks under the Mack,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and UD brands as well as its own name, raised its European truck market outlook but scaled back expectations for both Brazil and North America, where it now forecasts a 14 percent fall.The North American outlook chimed with that of its rivals, with Germany's Daimler forecasting a 10 percent decline for class 6-8 trucks and U.S. Paccar (O:PCAR) predicting a 12 percent drop in retail sales of class 8 trucks alone, the heaviest segment. ""During the first quarter we will adjust production to the new lower level of demand in North America and Brazil,"" Lundstedt said in a statement.Volvo said new orders for its trucks fell 20 percent in the quarter versus a 16 percent decline seen by analysts, hit by steep declines in the western hemisphere.But in Europe, where the group had been expected to show some of its strongest margins, order bookings rose 20 percent.""It is positive that they had an order intake rise of 20 percent in Europe,"" Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said. ""That is better than both Scania and Daimler in the quarter, showing they are winning market share."" At its other major arm, its construction equipment business which accounts for a fifth of group sales, Volvo slumped to a loss versus an expected slim profit and retained a forecast for a continued slump of 10-20 percent in the Chinese market.The company proposed an unchanged dividend of 3.0 crowns per share, below a forecast 3.18 crowns.Volvo shares were trading 0.3 percent higher at 0828 GMT.($1 = 8.4044 Swedish crowns)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Not at all, because this market is not going to stop,"" Daniel told reporters ahead of the opening ceremony. ""Entering a market of 20 million vehicles a year is no bad thing for a manufacturer.""Renault has until now remained a marginal player in China. Unlike Nissan, its 43.4 percent-owned Japanese affiliate, Renault has lacked any local production capacity, relying instead on less profitable imports such as the South Korean-built Koleos sport utility vehicle.But its arrival as a manufacturer - one of the last among major western automakers - coincides with a weakening of the Chinese economy and car demand.After an abrupt slowdown in mid-2015 and partial recovery later in the year, the market is likely to grow 4-6 percent in 2016, Renault-Nissan predicts, a healthy clip by European standards but a far cry from the double-digit expansions of preceding years.Renault's catch-up strategy is to bet on the SUV segment, however, which accounts for one-third of the Chinese market and is still growing at a rate approaching 50 percent.On its first production line, employing some 2,000 workers, the Dongfeng-Renault plant is about to begin assembling the French brand's Kadjar compact SUV, followed by a larger version later this year and an electric Fluence sedan in 2017.""A second (line) would very easy to install,"" Daniel said on the eve of the inauguration. ""And we have enough space for a third if needed.""Renault is already in the process of increasing its China sales network to 150 dealerships from 125 last year, he added, and would add more with any future plant expansions.(This story has been refiled to drop extraneous word 'the' from lead paragraph)"

Officials have said certain ""commitments"" could now be agreed, although how definitive they are is unclear.""We don't see any obstacles for companies who would want to come and invest in Iran,"" Rouhani told a French business delegation. ""My coming here is to show that Iran is ready for investments,"" he added, speaking through a translator.Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier, who was part of the French delegation, said that he held talks this month in Tehran with government and Iran Air officials that could lead to the rapid sale of aircraft.""We are at the disposal of our Iranian counterparts to help renew the fleet,"" Bregier said. Iran urgently needs modern, safer and less-polluting airliners after decades of being unable to obtain spare parts or new models due to sanctions.After starting his trip to Paris by meeting some 20 company executives, Rouhani is due to deliver a speech to business leaders on Thursday at a Franco-Iranian forum, where Iranian ministers will outline their plans.Several agreements are due to be announced after a meeting with President Francois Hollande.Iranian officials have said they are poised to agree on a deal for Airbus aircraft. Carmakers Peugeot and  Renault  (PA:RENA) may also agree contracts.Airport design and construction talks may be on the agenda too, potentially involving builders  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) and Vinci and airports operator ADP.Although many sanctions relating to Iran's nuclear program have been lifted, most U.S. measures remain in place. Companies are worried about the sanctions snapping back if Iran violated the terms of the nuclear agreement and are including this scenario in their risk analysis.""Investing in Iran is not exactly like investing in Holland or Denmark,"" a French diplomatic source said. ""Everyone wants to be certain that there's no Damocles Sword hanging over them before investing."""

Baker(Reuters) -  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Europe's biggest industrial group, has agreed to buy CD-adapco, a privately held U.S. engineering software firm, for close to $1 billion in cash, according to a person familiar with the matter.Siemens's deal with CD-adapco could be announced as early as Monday, the person said, asking not to be identified because the agreement is not yet public. The two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Melville, New York-based CD-adapco makes computer programs used by engineers to simulate the inner workings of an engine. Those products will complement a business unit of Siemens focused on product lifecycle management software, the person added.Since taking over Siemens as chief executive two years ago, former finance chief Joe Kaeser has set out to reshape the German company and make it more profitable and less cumbersome by selling off non-core units.But Siemens has increasingly had to compete with software companies who can develop technology faster because they have a sole focus. Only 5 percent of Siemens' 350,000 employees are software engineers.Siemens said in December it would raise its research and development budget as it seeks to maintain an edge in technology innovation over arch-rival  General Electric  Co (N:GE).The sale comes after CD-adapco's co-founder and CEO Steve MacDonald passed away last September. He was succeeded by his widow, Sharron MacDonald, who was named interim CEO and president. Established in 1980 and still controlled by its founders, the company has 900 employees in 50 offices and has achieved $200 million in annual revenue and an annual growth rate of 15 percent for the past five years, according to its website. Its main competitor in engine simulation software is Ansys Inc (O:ANSS).NASA hired CD-adapco to help with simulation of structural engineering problems following the Space Challenger disaster in 1986. Car maker  Renault  SA's (PA:RENA) designers have also used CD-adapco software to simulate engine combustion, cooling and exhaust for Formula One race cars.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A spokesman declined further comment.Renault had disputed November claims by German environmental group DUH that its popular Espace model released NOx emissions 25 times over legal limits during a Swiss study.But French Green deputy Denis Baupin, a member of the technical committee overseeing the investigation, said on Friday it was still ""too early to say"" whether Renault had committed any fraud by claiming compliance with pollution rules.""With Renault at risk of being the next (manufacturer) to face an emissions scandal, investors may remain understandably nervous"" about the sector, Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Stuart  Pearson  (L:PSON) said. ""The industry is not yet out of the woods."" Renault's share plunge also appeared to delay a planned reduction of the government's stake in the carmaker, as Macron said the stake sale would now wait until the price improved.""Our intention is not to sell these shares at a loss to the taxpayer,"" the economy minister told reporters.Macron had pledged to cut the holding back to its longstanding 15 percent level after raising it to 19.7 percent last April in order to secure double voting rights in a vote at the company's 2015 shareholder meeting.""We will divest these shares only when they have returned to their normal price,"" he said, without elaborating on the required level.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

She also said other manufacturers in France had been visited by the fraud investigators. Renault shares fell as much as 22 percent after union officials first said the sites had been searched, prompting the company to issue a statement confirming the inspections.It said fraud investigators were looking at the way it uses exhaust emissions technology in an additional inquiry of parts and factories that follows an earlier investigation by the French government.Volkswagen last year admitted to using software to conceal the level of toxic emissions from some of its diesel vehicles in the United States. It faces billions of dollars in claims from owners of vehicles with similar software installed around the world.The case has prompted investigations across several countries into Volkswagen, as well as checks on other car manufacturers and a tightening of emissions regulations which some industry analysts think could hit the entire diesel vehicle industry - a key market for Renault The French company saw some 5 billion euros erased from its market capitalization in the worst day since its shares were first listed in 1994, according to Reuters data.

By 2018, Ghosn said the alliance will start selling vehicles with ""multiple-lane control,"" meaning they can autonomously change lanes on highways and navigate heavy traffic. By 2020, the alliance will have cars that can drive through city intersections and heavy city traffic on their own. Several companies, including  Tesla Motors  (O:TSLA) and  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL), are working to build self-driving cars and technology that allows users to control their cars from their smartphones. Renault-Nissan is a partnership between Paris-based Renault and Japanese carmaker Nissan that combined the companies' engineering teams. They still operate as two separate companies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1122,"Dec 16, 2015 07:28AM ET",German lobby group says excess emissions detected in Mercedes model,nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - German environmental lobby group DUH turned on carmaker  Daimler  on Wednesday, saying test results had shown nitrogen oxide emissions from one of its Mercedes diesel models far exceeded European legal limits.Daimler (DE:DAIGn) described the results from a Mercedes C-Class 200 CDI as ""questionable"", saying the model used technology that met European Union standards and threatening legal action should ""false claims"" damage its reputation.Citing tests carried out by the University of Applied Sciences in Bern, Switzerland, DUH told a news conference that the car, a 2011 model, had released emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) that were more than twice the legal limits when tested with a warm engine under new European testing cycles.The carmaker took issue with DUH's assertions. ""The test results are questionable as the conditions of the test are not clear. We don't know the specific car, the temperature at the time of the tests, the loading weight,"" a Daimler spokesman said.Fellow German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is engulfed in a scandal after rigging the results of exhaust emissions tests in the United States. DUH has made charges against a number of other motor manufacturers. In October it said a model built by General Motors' (N:GM) Opel division had shown excessive emissions of nitrous oxide, an assertion that was denied by Opel at the time. French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) has also contested findings cited by DUH that one of its minivans released toxic diesel emissions 25 times over legal limits.Daimler said in a statement on Wednesday that the car tested in Switzerland used technology certified in 2007 that met the EU's Euro-5 standard. It acknowledged that results under real driving conditions often differed from those in a laboratory.In September, DUH accused Daimler of also rigging emissions data, charges the company denied at the time. It repeated the denial on Wednesday, saying: ""We reserve at all times the right to take legal action should false claims or unjustified allegations damage the reputation of our company.""TEST DISCREPANCIESThe discrepancies between laboratory-based results and real-world emissions measurements are part of a wider pattern that affects the entire auto industry and not just VW, Opel and Renault, according to DUH.Axel Friedrich, a former official at the German environmental protection agency, said this was also the case with the Mercedes model. ""If we had tested other vehicles from other manufacturers, we would have determined the same or similar results,"" he told the DUH news conference.Friedrich is a co-founder of the Washington-based International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) which commissioned the original investigation that led to the exposure of VW's test-rigging in the United States.Separate tests commissioned by German public broadcaster ZDF, also conducted by the Swiss university and aired on Tuesday, found that a BMW 3-Series 320d model released more toxic diesel emissions in real-world testing than in the lab. BMW (DE:BMWG) denied its cars had the kind of ""defeat device"" that VW used to manipulate the tests.""Our vehicles carry no illegal devices,"" a BMW spokesman said on Wednesday. ""The emissions behavior does not distinguish between a vehicle on a dynamometer or in on-road use. We emphatically reject any speculation to the contrary.""Separately, public prosecutors in the German city of Stuttgart said on Wednesday they were investigating whether staff at auto parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH were involved in the rigging of emissions tests by Volkswagen.Stuttgart-based Bosch [ROBG.UL], which makes a diesel engine management program used by several top automakers including VW declined to comment on specific investigations.A company spokesman said: ""We are cooperating in principle with all authorities who want to contribute to the clarification of the facts.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1124,"Dec 11, 2015 11:52PM ET",Renault-Nissan's French peace deal leaves investors underwhelmed,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan alliance drew a line under an eight-month power struggle with the French government on Friday, with a compromise deal balancing increased state influence at  Renault  with weakened control over its Japanese affiliate.The agreement, offering Nissan (T:7201) guarantees against future interference by parent Renault (PA:RENA) or its own biggest shareholder, the French state, came as a relief to Renault staff while disappointing some investors who had hoped for bigger changes to the 16-year-old carmaking alliance.Tension had been building since April, when Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron temporarily raised France's Renault stake to secure a permanent increase in its voting rights - and enough clout to veto strategic decisions or tie-ups that might one day endanger domestic jobs or other national interests.That move raised hackles at Nissan, 43.4 percent-owned by Renault, and infuriated alliance Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who has headed both carmakers for the last decade.Renault shares fell on Friday after its board approved two new contracts to cap the French state's increased weight in non-strategic shareholder votes and effectively abandon Renault's right to control Nissan strategy.""We've certainly lost a bit, but Nissan has accepted that France has increased voting rights on important strategic questions,"" one Renault manager said.Nissan said it was ""very pleased"" with the agreement, having earlier threatened to exit the carmakers' 2002 alliance agreement unless a deal was reached by Friday, a move that would immediately free it to raise its 15 percent Renault stake. An increase to 25 percent would cancel Renault's voting rights in Nissan under Japanese law, effectively ending French control.Instead, the deal allows Nissan to lift its Renault holding to 25 percent - or beyond - only in the event of interference by Renault or by Paris that breaches the new undertakings.The small shift in the balance of power reflects economic realities on the ground. Since its 1999 rescue by Renault, Nissan has outgrown its French parent and now leads the way in engineering and other key areas, within an alliance now ranked as the world's fourth-largest carmaker by combined sales.But the changes disappointed investors who had hoped that Ghosn, 61, might use the crisis to carry out deeper alliance reforms or even a full merger - unlocking some of the $20 billion market value of Renault's large Nissan stake.""It seems a very ugly solution and I can't imagine the market will like it,"" said a London-based special situations investor at a $40 billion fund that had bet on bigger moves before trimming its position as the weaker compromise loomed.""They're really just kicking the can down the road,"" he said.Renault shares sagged after an initial Reuters report on the draft compromise, eventually closing 5.3 percent lower after the deal was announced.The conflict burst into public view after Macron deployed 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of public money to raise France's Renault stake to 19.7 percent and block Ghosn's proposal to opt out of a new law giving long-term shareholders double voting rights.Even after its holding is pared back to 15 percent, France will command 28 percent of votes when the Florange law takes effect at the end of March, enough to veto strategic decisions.Ghosn sparred with Martin Vial, Macron's top official in charge of state holdings, for much of Friday's five-hour board session, sources said afterwards.Agreement to cap the government's voting rights at their previous 17.9 percent level - for ordinary, non-strategic resolutions - came only after Ghosn called a break to speak to the minister by phone.Under a face-saving formula yet to be finalised, the limit will rise to 20 percent at unusually well-attended shareholder meetings. It would be lifted entirely if Renault or Nissan were to violate the pact with France or modify their own alliance agreement without government approval.Nissan, which had called for drastic changes to the alliance's crossed shareholdings in a confidential September proposal revealed by Reuters, gave up many of those demands in the compromise deal.Instead, for the first time, it received written assurances that Renault will never attempt to control the Nissan board or propose resolutions to its shareholder meeting without its approval - a substantial concession depriving its main shareholder of some fundamental prerogatives. ""I believe the alliance emerges stronger from this debate,"" Ghosn told reporters on a conference call afterwards. But analysts weren't so sure.Dominic O'Brien of Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) called the outcome a ""missed opportunity"" for Ghosn to lay the groundwork for a full Renault-Nissan merger - the widely expected end result of the companies' ever-closer operational cooperation.""It's a big disappointment,"" O'Brien said. ""This was a chance to set things up so that if the industrial merger goes according to plan, the financial one becomes a no-brainer.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

French officials also indicated that agreement had been reached in principle in some areas of the dispute, with details yet to be worked out.Tension has been building since April, when Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron temporarily raised the government's Renault stake to secure a permanent increase in its voting rights - and enough clout to veto strategic decisions or tie-ups that might one day endanger domestic interests including jobs.The move raised hackles at Nissan, 43.4 percent-owned by Renault, pitting Macron against alliance Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who has headed both carmakers for the last decade.Since its 1999 rescue by Renault, Nissan has outgrown its French parent and now leads the way in engineering and other key areas, within an alliance now ranked as the world's fourth-largest carmaker by combined sales.Renault-Nissan declined to comment on the ongoing talks.Unless a deal is reached before Renault's board meets on Friday, Nissan has threatened to exit a 2002 alliance agreement currently barring it from raising its non-voting 15 percent stake in its French parent. Lifting the holding to 25 percent would cancel Renault's voting rights in Nissan under Japanese law, effectively ending French control of the alliance.""It's a serious threat,"" said a source with knowledge of the government's position.

""It's as if the government wants to find out whether it's a bluff.""At stake may be the future direction of Renault-Nissan. Under Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, the alliance ranks as the world's fourth-largest carmaker on a combined sales basis.The conflict reflects the disparity between formal structure, in which Renault has nominal control, and operations under Ghosn, who heads both carmakers. Since its 1999 rescue by Renault, Nissan has far outgrown its French parent and now leads the way in many engineering projects and other areas. Macron has warned Ghosn against making moves to loosen Renault's control of Nissan or leadership of the alliance.""Any unraveling or weakening of the links between the two companies cannot be a solution,"" he reiterated in a Sunday newspaper interview. Renault-Nissan declined to comment.France is boosting its corporate clout with a law granting long-term shareholders - including the state - double voting rights in any companies that do not opt out.Macron deployed 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of public cash to raise France's Renault stake temporarily to 19.7 percent and block Ghosn's opt-out proposal at the April shareholder meeting. Even after its holding is pared back to 15 percent, the state will command a blocking minority when the Florange law takes effect at the end of March.Macron on Sunday reiterated the government's compromise offer, first reported by Reuters, to limit the exercise of its additional voting rights to strategic questions.But Renault's proposal is likely to go much further, sources said, neutralizing its control with a binding pledge never to interfere in Nissan management - as demanded by the Japanese carmaker on Nov. 30 along with restrictions on the government votes.As a safeguard, Nissan wants to be authorized to increase its 15 percent Renault stake if the promise is broken. Once the holding reached 25 percent, Renault could lose the votes on its Nissan shares under Japanese law.In a sign that Macron may have given some ground, French officials privately acknowledge that any last-minute compromise would likely require a Renault-Nissan deal adjusting their relationship, defined in a 2002 alliance master agreement.But moves to end Renault control will meet stiff resistance, according to people familiar with government thinking.""That's not going to cut any ice,"" said one. ""With all the fuss they've made, Renault-Nissan have mainly succeeded in putting the state at the very center of their alliance.""Besides Ghosn, the 19-member Renault board consists of 10 independent directors, who have so far backed the CEO; four workers' representatives; two Nissan appointees; and two French government officials.Macron has demanded that Ghosn and both Nissan appointees abstain from voting to avoid conflicts of interest, sources say.The independents, including Danone Chairman Franck Riboud and Total's Thierry Desmarest, have also been criticized by French officials for betraying Renault - a charge they rebuffed in an unusual group statement last month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Parts of the flat, coastal city remained under up to eight feet (2.5 meters) of water for a fourth day.Many residents have spent days stranded on rooftops since more than 345 mm (14 inches) of rain fell over 24 hours on Dec. 1, the most since the British ruled the city then known as Madras 100 years ago.India's fourth-largest city has boomed in the 21st century as a center for vehicle factories and IT outsourcing, but trash filled drains and building on lake beds in the rush to industrialization and prosperity has made it more flood prone.Military helicopters dropped food to residents stranded on rooftops and the defense ministry doubled to 4,000 the number of soldiers deployed to help the rescue effort.Rescue teams urged people to leave inundated regions and hundreds thronged the streets in the morning seeking higher ground, or trying to rescue relatives. Only roofs in some villages remained visible. Where water had receded, masses of black mud and garbage piled up.In one of the most shocking incidents, 14 patients in the intensive care unit of the MIOT International hospital died after floods took out generators running life-support systems, Prithvi Mohandas, a doctor at the hospital, told reporters.Tamil Nadu's health secretary confirmed the deaths but said the cause needed to be investigated. Despite combined rescue efforts by the military and civilian emergency services, help had yet to reach many areas and city-dwellers grew impatient as it emerged that authorities had released water from brimming lakes without much warning.V. Raghunathan, 60, a manager at an interior design company living in the south of the booming industrial and port city, complained about the lack of warning before flood gates were opened on some of Chennai's 30 waterways.""The authorities didn't give us adequate information about water being released from a nearby lake. Before we could take action my car had sunk and I had to move to the first floor of my apartment.""The Tamil Nadu public works department said it did issue warnings, but the information apparently did not reach the public because of a breakdown in media and phone communications. The Chennai edition of The Hindu newspaper did not go to press on Thursday, apparently for the first time in 137 years.""We are sending technical experts and engineers who will find a solution to flush out all the flood water. It has to be drained out soon, but we don't know how,"" said a home ministry official, who was not authorized to speak on the record and asked not to be identified.FACTORIES CLOSEDThe government restored some commercial flights to a naval air base near the city of six million, but the main airport remained closed and completely awash. Car factories that export around the world were also shut.Affected carmakers such as  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Hyundai Motor and component maker Apollo Tyres will decide on Saturday whether to resume production, whereas BMW will keep a plant closed until Dec. 7.A steadily rising number of families sought safety on the city's Basion Bridge flyover, many of them slum-dwellers whose homes had been washed away. They sat in the open, carrying little bundles of prized possessions - soiled rupee notes and identity cards.A small van that arrived at the top of the flyover bearing water packets and biscuits was immediately over-run by people desperate for relief.Rajarwadi, who sold vegetables by the roadside, managed to grab a packet of biscuits for her daughter. She hadn't seen government officials help people camped out on the busy flyover on Thursday even though it was in the middle of the city.Jose Sebastian, the head of a local construction company, said the biggest worry for his volunteer group was areas where the water level was too high for them to deliver food.

Reuters exclusively reported the plot to attack the district of La Defense on Nov. 18.Molins said he had put under formal investigation a Frenchman who had provided lodging for Abaaoud and his associates at the apartment in the suburb of St. Denis.""Jawad Bendaoud himself welcomed the terrorists on Nov. 17 towards 10:45 p.m. He could not have been in any doubt ... that he was taking part in a terrorist organisation,"" Molins told a news conference.Bendaoud said that before he was detained by police last Wednesday he had been asked to put up two people for three days in the apartment, but had no idea one of them may have been the suspected mastermind of the Nov. 13 attacks.Abaaoud died during the police raid along with Hasna Aitboulahcen, a woman believed to be his cousin, and an as yet unidentified third person.BRUSSELS LOCKDOWNFrench investigators are still piecing together exactly who did what when and have launched a hunt to find Salah Abdeslam, who is suspected of being the eighth attacker mentioned by Islamic State when it claimed responsibility.Abdeslam, 26, fled to Belgium the day after the shootings and his presumed presence in Brussels was one of the factors behind a security lockdown in the city over the past few days.Fearing an imminent Paris-style attack, Belgium has extended a maximum security alert in Brussels until next Monday. About half the stations on its metro system will reopen on Wednesday along with city schools, but 300 additional police officers and 200 soldiers will be deployed.Belgium has been at the heart of investigations into the attacks since France said two of the suicide bombers in Paris had lived there. Five people, including two who travelled with Abdeslam back to Brussels, have been charged with terrorist offences in Belgium. Abdeslam's brother, Brahim, blew himself up.Belgium's state prosecutor, in a statement announcing details of other people charged in the case, said on Tuesday it had issued an international arrest warrant for Mohamed Abrini, who was seen with Abdeslam two days before the attacks.Abrini, 30, was filmed with Abdeslam at a fuel station in northern France on Nov. 11 and was driving the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Clio car later used by the attackers in the French capital.A police wanted poster described Abrini as ""dangerous and probably armed"".While major shopping centres in Brussels remained closed on Tuesday, two Ikea furniture stores on the edge of town reopened, along with some of the larger supermarkets in the city.The Magritte museum remained shut, however, and Brussels had yet to decide whether to open its Christmas market on Friday in the historic Grand Place, where workers have set up stalls with an armoured personnel carrier in the background.""We are at the time of year when we are supposed to have a lot of people, and increase business,"" said Brussels toy shop worker Laeticia Shalaj. ""People are scared and are afraid of leaving their homes.""Since the Paris killings, France has moved its flagship Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier into the eastern Mediterranean to step up its bombardments of Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq.France said late on Tuesday its warplanes had destroyed an Islamic State command centre at Tal Afar, some 45 km (28 miles) west of Mosul in Iraq. After talks with Hollande at the White House, Obama said: ""We are here today to declare that the United States and France stand united in total solidarity to deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them and to defend our nations.""As millions of Americans prepare to travel for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Obama acknowledged fear among Americans of a Paris-style attack in the United States.The White House said Obama was set to meet on Wednesday morning with his national security advisers to review the ""homeland security posture"" of the United States after the Paris attacks and ""as we enter the holiday season.""The president was briefed that there is currently no specific, credible threat to the homeland"" from Islamic State, the White House said.Hollande is due to visit Moscow on Thursday, where he and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss ways of boosting their campaign to crush Islamic State.EXPLOSIVE BELT?Tracing Abdeslam's movements since the attacks has been a main focus of the investigations in Paris. An explosive belt was found dumped near the capital on Monday, close to a location where his mobile phone was detected the night after the attacks, the prosecutor said.Molins said the belt was similar to those used by the bombers during the Nov. 13 attacks, although it was still being established on Tuesday whether the belt was Abdeslam's.One theory was that Abdeslam had intended to blow himself up in the 18th district of Paris but had abandoned the plan, although it was not clear why.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1132,"Nov 24, 2015 11:40AM ET",Renault in campaigners' sights as diesel ripples spread,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Laurence FrostBERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) flagship Espace minivan released toxic diesel emissions 25 times legal limits in a Swiss study despite complying with EU tests carried out at unrealistically low engine temperatures, a German green group said on Tuesday.The tests commissioned by the green lobby group DUH, which have not been independently verified, will add to pressure on carmakers and lawmakers in the wake of the scandal over Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) admission that it used illegal ""defeat devices"" to cheat diesel regulations.Environmental and consumer groups are leading calls for improved European Union tests to bring soaring real-world emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide into line with legal limits.The DUH, which had earlier singled out General Motors' Opel brand over results suggesting high NOx emissions outside the regulator's lab, turned its fire on France's  Renault  in a report commissioned from the University of Applied Sciences in Bern.When run with a warm or hot engine, a 1.6-litre Espace of the latest Euro 6 diesel generation emitted up to 2.06 grams of NOx per kilometer, the campaign group said, more than 25 times the EU limit. The vehicle met the statutory 80 milligram cap only with a cold engine after ""specific pre-conditioning"".Renault did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment. GM (N:GM) last month rejected similar DUH findings on its Opel Zafira model, after running its own tests monitored by Germany's TUV certification body.The VW diesel scandal has drawn attention to a wider pattern of legal test manipulation that stops short of outright cheating. The EU rules themselves are now acknowledged to be inadequate even by carmakers such as PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP).Carmakers routinely strip out standard equipment to reduce test vehicles' mass, tape up door joints and fit bald tyres that would be illegal on the road. Tuesday's DUH findings may shed light on the real-world impact of optimizing engines to pass tests only when cold - which would be another tactic allowed by the current regime.The DUH study was published in cooperation with the Washington-based International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which commissioned the original investigation that led eventually to the outing of VW.""It's unbelievable that so-called modern diesel vehicles that damage the air we breathe in this way are on the road today,"" ICCT co-founder Axel Friedrich said in a statement.Europe needs a ""comprehensive reorganization of the system in which mandatory regular controls on the street are integrated"", he said.EU moves to phase in real-world emissions measurements were watered down in committee last month under sustained German-led lobbying.Volkswagen admitted in September to rigging U.S. diesel emissions tests, unleashing a scandal that forced out longstanding CEO Martin Winterkorn and may cost the group as much as 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in recall costs, fines and compensation, some analysts estimate.($1 = 0.9397 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But we don't know why. Maybe he had a technical problem with his explosive belt, for example,"" said a police source.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1135,"Nov 13, 2015 10:21AM ET",Exclusive: French compromise snubbed as Renault-Nissan pursues shake-up - sources,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - France has offered to limit its voting rights at  Renault  (PA:RENA) in a bid to end its power struggle with the carmaker and partner Nissan, but their combined CEO Carlos Ghosn remains determined to push through changes that would give the Japanese company more say over the alliance, sources said.The government overture, and its chilly reception, suggest the standoff with Ghosn may have slipped beyond the control of Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron.The row became public in April when Macron increased France's stake in Renault to secure double voting rights. That raised hackles in Tokyo and prompted preparatory work by the alliance to alter its balance of power in Nissan's favor.Sources with knowledge of the matter say the government has now softened its stance, offering to limit its voting rights just hours before an emergency Renault board meeting on Nov. 6. They gave no details of the proposed cap.However Hiroto Saikawa, Ghosn's second-in-command at Nissan (T:7201), expressed deep dissatisfaction with the French position during the meeting, one of the sources said. ""Just going back to the situation of seven months ago is not enough,"" said a Renault-Nissan insider familiar with alliance thinking. ""It's clear there has to be a better balance between the two companies.""Spokespersons for Renault, Nissan and the French government declined to comment.Renault currently owns a 43.4 percent controlling stake in Nissan, which nonetheless accounts for two-thirds of combined vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit. Nissan in turn holds a non-voting 15 percent of its French parent, with Ghosn, 61, heading both carmakers.Macron, a former investment banker, has led the push for increased state influence at Renault to safeguard domestic jobs, engineering skills and other strategic French interests.France temporarily raised its Renault stake from 15 to 19.7 percent to block Ghosn's proposed opt-out from the Florange law, which will give double votes to long-term investors from the end of March. Under the new law, the state will wield a blocking minority at shareholder meetings even after its holding is cut back to 15 percent.In response, Nissan drew up proposals to end Renault's control by replacing the current alliance structure with ""better balanced"" 25-35 percent crossed shareholdings, sources told Reuters last month.The Renault board has formally backed action to restore Nissan's voting rights in the French carmaker, the sources said - a move that would require Renault to cut its Nissan stake.IMPATIENCEThe latest olive branch from Paris resembles an earlier compromise offer. Weeks before Renault's April 30 shareholder meeting, Macron volunteered to limit the increase in government voting rights if Ghosn dropped his proposed opt-out from the Florange law.But the Renault board pressed ahead with the resolution, and France deployed 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of public funds to raise its stake and successfully block it.In recent days, however, Macron has also backed away from an earlier push for a Renault-Nissan merger on French terms.A full tie-up ""is not on the agenda"", the minister said on Tuesday, a week after sources told Reuters he had urged Ghosn for months to set up a merger working group.Last week's Renault board meeting created an ad-hoc subcommittee to oversee continuing negotiations between the French government and Nissan, but the Japanese carmaker publicly voiced impatience with the process.In a sign of Nissan's determination to make changes regardless of any French retreat, Chief Competitive Officer Saikawa said the voting rights showdown had ""highlighted"", rather than created, an imbalance in the partnership.""Nissan would like to put this matter behind us as soon as possible so that we can reestablish the foundations of a successful alliance and focus on our real business,"" he said.Saikawa is to brief the Nissan board within weeks, sources said, before Renault directors reconvene on Dec. 11.

[FRX/] It had advanced to a 2-1/2-month peak of 123.49 yen . The euro was higher at $1.0772  having struck a 6-month trough of $1.0704 on Friday.Some analysts said the ECB's aggressive talk about cutting rates and more money printing at its last meeting had been because of the euro's strength - and the fact that it had now fallen back made any major cuts less likely.""The lower euro/dollar goes, the less need there is for the ECB to do more,"" said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) currency strategist Michael Sneyd in London.EMERGING PRESSURE Emerging Asian currencies and stocks (MSCIEF), which took the brunt of some heavy global selling over August and September were back in the firing line as the prospect of a Fed hike next month loomed ever larger.India's rupee  slumped to its weakest in more than six weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's heavy defeat in Bihar's state elections raised concerns the government would struggle to pass policy reforms markets have been hoping for.The Philippine peso  also hit a six-year low. The South Korean won , the Malaysian ringgit  and the Thai baht  touched one-month troughs. Indonesia's rupiah  fell to its weakest in more than two weeks.After the U.S. jobs data which saw the largest gain in jobs since last December and the unemployment rate fall to 5.0 percent, it lowest since April 2008, interest rates futures were now pricing in a 70 percent probability that the U.S. central bank will raise borrowing costs next month.Treasury yields continued to creep higher in Europe having soared on Friday. The key 2-year yield (US2YT=RR), the most sensitive to a near-term rate hike, was at a 5-1/2-year high. [US/]Europe's benchmark German Bund yields were being dragged higher too, while Portuguese government bond yields hit a 10-week high after leftist parties agreed to form an alternative government to try to oust the center-right in a vote this week.There was also uncertainty in neighboring Spain, where Catalan separatists are expected to approve on Monday in the regional parliament a motion saying the process to split the northeastern region from Spain has started.Among commodities, the strength of the dollar remained the theme. London copper slipped further below the $5,000 mark towards a six-year low, after the China trade data underlined struggling growth in the world's top metals user.Spot gold  struggled near a 3-month low of $1,084.90 an ounce though oil prices rebounded on bargain hunting as OPEC said it expected global demand to remain strong next year.

1138,"Nov 04, 2015 10:41AM ET",Exclusive: Renault-Nissan boardroom fight masks French merger push,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron is pressuring  Renault  (PA:RENA) boss Carlos Ghosn to undertake a full merger with alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) on the government's terms, people with knowledge of the matter said.Macron's push sheds more light on a power struggle that burst into public view when the government, the French carmaker's biggest shareholder, raised its Renault stake in April to secure double voting rights.It also represents a change of stance by the government, which has previously been wary of an outright Renault-Nissan combination that would weaken its grip on the partnership. Renault shares surged on the initial Reuters report.Macron has been urging the Renault-Nissan CEO for months to set up a joint working group with his officials to explore merger scenarios that would tie Renault to its more profitable partner and safeguard French plants and jobs, government and company sources said.Ghosn, who heads both carmakers, has ignored the demands and may instead be forced to ""reactivate"" his own consolidation options, according to alliance insiders. These include ideas for a full merger - with less government influence - that were drawn up in 2013 with input from Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and set aside.""This is causing him to go faster than he had planned to,"" a company source said. ""I would never count Ghosn out.""The boardroom tussle has exposed rival visions for the future of Renault-Nissan, a 16-year-old industrial pairing held together by crossed shareholdings. Renault owns a 43.4 percent controlling stake in Nissan, which holds a non-voting 15 percent of its French parent.In a riposte to Macron, Nissan has proposed ending French control by acquiring a bigger Renault stake to establish ""better balanced"" reciprocal holdings of 25-35 percent, sources have told Reuters. Ghosn already has board support to cut Renault's Nissan stake, they said.Renault has called an emergency board meeting later this week, government and company sources said on Tuesday, amid signs the carmakers may begin adjusting the shareholdings within days or weeks, in defiance of Paris.The company's stock rose as much as 8 percent in an hour on Wednesday, before giving up some of its gains. Renault's shares were changing hands for 91.51 euros at 1510 GMT, up 1.4 percent on Tuesday's closing price.""A sell-down of Renault's stake in Nissan should unlock financial value, as the market currently puts a 15-25 percent discount on (the) stake,"" Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Stuart  Pearson  (L:PSON) said in a recent note.In his first public comments on the issue, Hiroto Saikawa, Ghosn's second-in-command at Nissan, said on Monday that increased French government influence on Renault was a concern for the Japanese carmaker.Spokespersons for Renault-Nissan and the French government declined to comment on the companies' plans or the discussions between Ghosn and Macron.DEADLINE 2017Past governments have resisted a full tie-up because Nissan's superior scale and profitability would likely shift the combined center of gravity away from France and dilute the voting weight of the state's shareholding in Renault.Since Renault rescued Nissan from near-bankruptcy, the Japanese carmaker has outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of combined vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit.But a new French law that doubles voting rights for longer-term investors, including the state, has emboldened Macron, a former investment banker, to seek an outright Renault-Nissan deal in which French interests would remain on top.""It's been a while now that Macron has been putting this to Carlos Ghosn,"" said a source close to the government, adding the minister was determined to force a deal through before 2017, a national election year.In April, Macron raised the government's Renault holding to 19.7 percent from 15 percent in order to block Ghosn's proposed opt-out from the double voting rules at the company's shareholder meeting.Around the same time, the minister began pressing Ghosn to discuss a merger that would ""preserve strategic French interests"" including jobs at a combined company ideally based in France, the source said. ""But the group was never set up.""Another French condition is that the government remains the main shareholder of the new group, officials have said.But Renault-Nissan merger plans previously explored by Ghosn would look quite different, according to people with knowledge of those discussions.An alliance task force considered a new combined company headquartered in a third country and listed in Paris and Tokyo, they said, and Goldman Sachs was later consulted on some aspects. A bank spokesman had no immediate comment.Ghosn decided a merger was too complex and time-consuming to be pursued immediately, and more operational convergence was needed first. Four alliance-wide executive roles were announced in early 2014.In the wake of Macron's intervention, however, investment bankers have been dusting off their pitches for a Renault-Nissan deal most observers believe will come eventually.Besides protecting Nissan, the planned stake changes may help Ghosn prepare for a merger on his companies' terms, alliance sources say. A deal based on today's holdings would hand greater power to Renault shareholders including France. ""This is not about giving Nissan more influence or board clout at Renault,"" said a senior alliance executive. ""It's really in view of a tie-up, so that the combination will be better balanced.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The analysis did not include filings made after 2013 due to a lag between filing and publication.They haven't yet landed significant business, and Samsung Group declined to comment on strategy, but the lure is obvious.Automakers already incorporate or are developing technologies to enhance safety and provide better smartphone connectivity and entertainment systems, creating an opening for tech companies to break into a market for software, services and components that is worth around $500 billion, ABI Research analyst Dominique Bonte said.""There are two trends: the car becomes a connected software device, and the entire mobile and ICT ecosystem is getting very interested in playing a part in that evolution,"" Bonte said.That is particularly welcome as demand for smartphones, TVs and computers slows, but Samsung is arriving late at a party where some of the best partners are already taken.Cross-town rival  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) announced a major supply agreement with General Motors (N:GM) in October, sending LG's shares surging, while U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp, known for graphics processors that power games consoles and laptops, says its chips will be in more than 30 million cars in the next three to four years. Unlike Apple (O:AAPL)  and Google (O:GOOGL), there is no clear sign yet that Samsung is developing its own autonomous driving technology.IHS analyst Danny Kim said Samsung Group does not yet have a unified, group-wide approach to building its supplier presence in the industry.""Samsung needs a serious commitment to drive the synergies between all competent organisations within Samsung Group,"" he said.A decade after selling its debt-laden carmaking unit to  Renault  (PA:RENA), Samsung Group in 2010 announced its second foray into the auto industry, identifying car batteries as one of its five growth businesses.Its  Samsung SDI  Co Ltd (KS:006400) is now the world's No. 6 electric car battery maker, counting BMW (DE:BMWG), Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) among its clients.IN THE HUNTOther parts of the Samsung empire are now in the hunt.Samsung patent filings show a wide range of technologies including a drowsy-driving detection system, an alert system for break-in attempts and a transparent display for directions and traffic information. Samsung Electro-Mechanics  Co Ltd (KS:009150) recently formed a dedicated team to sell components such as camera modules to new auto clients and says it would consider acquisitions to boost car-related businesses.Samsung Display has also cited the auto industry as a potential growth area and has been testing its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays with BMW and auto parts maker Continental (DE:CONG).The growth prospects are mouthwatering.Nvidia says its autos revenue was $148 million for the first half of this fiscal year, nearly doubling in a year.Consulting firm McKinsey said in a 2014 report that revenue from hardware, software and services for connectivity-enabled cars could grow to 180 billion euros ($200 billion) by 2020 from an estimated 30 billion euros in 2014.Carmakers may spend an additional $6,500 per car when they launch fully autonomous vehicles, the Boston Consulting Group said in a report this year.Analysts say the supply relationships built by SDI could be expanded by bundling parts and services from other Samsung arms.Samsung insiders acknowledge, however, that it may take several years before tech arms other than Samsung SDI generate significant auto-related sales.Product development cycles in the auto industry are far longer than in consumer electronics, and carmakers are cautious about adding suppliers without a track record. It took the better part of a decade for Nvidia to gain acceptance as a global supplier, while LG worked with GM for nearly a decade before it got its supply contract for the Chrevrolet Bolt.Samsung Electronics could still catch up by taking the one-stop-shop approach, similar to that of LG Electronics, by working with sister companies to combine offerings such as batteries, chips, sensors and software such as the Tizen operating system into a single package, analysts say.ABI's Bonte said Samsung could also speed things up by acquiring established players such as Japan's  Renesas Electronics Corp  (T:6723), which researcher Gartner says was the world's top auto semiconductor maker last year, with $3.1 billion in revenue.""It's important for a supplier to be able to sell not just one single component but provide that entire platform,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1143,"Oct 27, 2015 04:09AM ET",Exclusive: Nissan seeks end to Renault control in French power struggle,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - Nissan Motor (T:7201) has drawn up proposals to exit  Renault  (PA:RENA) control by purchasing a larger stake in its French parent, sources told Reuters, amid an escalating power struggle between Renault-Nissan alliance boss Carlos Ghosn and the French state, Renault's biggest shareholder.In a three-page document passed to the French government, the Japanese carmaker calls for deep changes to the 16-year-old alliance, giving the companies equal weight in joint decisions and ""better balanced"" cross-shareholdings of 25-35 percent, government and company sources said.Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan and the casting vote in their Dutch-registered Renault-Nissan BV management structure. Nissan in turn owns a non-voting 15 percent of Renault.The Nissan demands are a response by 61-year-old Ghosn, CEO of both carmakers, to a surprise April move in which Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron raised France's Renault stake from 15 to 19.7 percent - informing Ghosn in a phone call only hours before the transaction took effect.The stake increase, described as temporary, allowed the government to force a permanent doubling of its voting rights through the company's shareholder meeting by blocking Ghosn's proposed opt-out from a new law entering force next year.A retaliatory plan to hand more power to Nissan - by restoring its voting rights in Renault to counter the government's increased clout - already has the Renault board's support. French state representatives abstained from the April 16 vote and have since contested its legitimacy, sources said.But the new Nissan proposals, in a Sept. 3 note initialed by Ghosn's second-in-command Hiroto Saikawa, go much further.Under French and Japanese law, the proposed 25-35 percent cross-shareholdings would allow Nissan to vote as Renault's biggest shareholder while depriving the French carmaker of any reciprocal say at Nissan meetings.That amounts to a ""reversal of the balance of power within the alliance to the detriment of Renault"", according to a French government source.Spokespersons for the French finance ministry, Renault, Nissan and their alliance declined to comment on the Japanese carmaker's proposals.""Nissan is fully committed to the success of the alliance and the considerable benefits the alliance has brought to all parties,"" company spokesman Jonathan Adashek said.NEW LOWThe standoff marks a new low in Ghosn's relationship with the French government. It also threatens the future of an automotive pairing often hailed as a rare success story in an industry whose recent past is littered with failed mergers.The clash with Macron, 37, a Rothschild banker turned Socialist government minister, has exposed rival visions for the alliance that began diverging at its 1999 origin, when Renault took its first controlling stake in a near-bankrupt Nissan.Renault's control is enshrined in an alliance master agreement allowing the French partner to appoint top Nissan executives. It also bars either company from issuing new shares or buying the other's stock without approval from its board.Anxious to safeguard domestic jobs and investment, France is determined to maintain influence over Renault-Nissan and would support a full merger ""only if the state remains the biggest shareholder"", in the words of one official.But Ghosn has consistently treated Nissan as an equal partner and previously tried to adjust the formal power balance to reflect economic reality: Nissan has outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of combined vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit.In a bid to head off his latest attempt, the government has privately criticized Renault board members for supporting measures it says would undermine the company's interests.""Carlos Ghosn is the head of two companies,"" said one official. ""At a certain point that creates conflicts.""Some aides see Nissan's demands as a ploy to persuade Macron to give up some of the doubled voting rights due to take effect on April 1 - as France uses the so-called Florange law to wield more shareholder power through its various company holdings.""This is a tactical game in which Ghosn is making clear the extreme irritation provoked by the state's intervention,"" said a source close to President Francois Hollande's administration.FOLLOW THROUGHGhosn's warning shot may be effective only if the government believes he is prepared to follow through with strategic steps against Renault's main shareholder.Such open defiance has been considered before, according to two people with direct knowledge of Renault-Nissan discussions - and may now be more likely following Macron's April move.During a 2011 scandal in which Renault was hoaxed into firing three executives falsely accused of selling company secrets, Nissan feared Ghosn might be replaced by a French appointee who would reassert the smaller carmaker's control.""They had a look at what the steps were for a nuclear option,"" said one source. Under the template that emerged, ""both boards declare the master agreement invalid and move quickly to have Nissan buy Renault shares and Renault sell Nissan.""In the end, Renault Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata resigned over the botched espionage investigation, relieving the pressure on his boss and averting a showdown.The next step in the current situation, according to Nissan's submission, could be a formal request to the Renault board, which meets in December, to modify the master agreement.Nissan is now seeking an equal partnership, based not only on trust ""but also by contract"", it says, to shield the Japanese company from Paris interference through Renault.If France pares its Renault stake back to 15 percent, as promised, it will still hold 28 percent of eligible votes at the next shareholder meeting, enough to guarantee a blocking minority. The current 19.7 percent holding would likely command an outright majority if maintained until April.That prospect is becoming more likely. Options purchased to ensure a minimum resale price on the shares - down 13 percent since April - are now being settled for cash, the government has said, leaving its raised holding intact. The hesitation has little to do with market conditions.""We knew from the start we might not sell, regardless of the markets, if Ghosn showed no signs of cooperating,"" said a government source with knowledge of the discussions.Senior officials are sitting on the full holding for now, he said, ""because they are nervous about what Ghosn is planning.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1144,"Oct 20, 2015 12:10PM ET",Airbus taps Siemens executive to run defense business,nan,"By Tim Hepher and Georgina ProdhanPARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airbus Group (PA:AIR) has named  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) executive Dirk Hoke as the next head of its Defence and Space division, recruiting an industrial high-flyer with no previous aerospace experience to regenerate its second-largest division.Hoke, 46, will join Europe's largest aerospace group in January and progressively take over from Bernhard Gerwert, who is due to retire in mid-2016, Airbus said on Tuesday.The recruitment of the former  Renault  (PA:RENA) research engineer from his role as head of Siemens' Customer Services Division will reduce the average age of the 15-member Airbus Group executive committee, populated mainly by aerospace veterans in their late fifties or older, to below 55.He will learn the ropes during the first quarter of next year and take over from Gerwert on April 1, Airbus said, adding that Gerwert will continue to advise him until June at least.Hoke's appointment reflects efforts by Airbus CEO Tom Enders to reach beyond aerospace as it contends with competition from other high-tech companies and pressures to adapt to digital manufacturing techniques.Enders said Hoke is ""well equipped for a world and business environment that is ever more accelerating"" and noted his experience in project management and services.Speaking to Siemens investors in 2013, Hoke hailed a ""manufacturing renaissance"" but emphasized the importance of reducing lead times from concept to market -- a perennial headache for a defense industry that is plagued by costly delays.At Airbus he will face challenges including slow deliveries of the A400M military airlifter and questions over strategy for drones and the long-term future of the Eurofighter jet, which is also backed by BAE Systems (L:BAES) and  Finmeccanica  (MI:SIFI).He joins at a tough time for Europe's defense industry, which is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back military spending. The Munich-based Defence & Space division was recently combined and slimmed down under Gerwert to focus on warplanes, missiles, satellites and space rockets.It reported a loss on flat revenue in the first half but remains the group's second-largest division by sales and orders behind the commercial aircraft business. By recruiting from one of a handful of German groups famed for grooming the country's elite managers, analysts said that Enders appeared to have recognized the lack of a younger generation of German-born industrial leaders inside his group.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1145,"Oct 15, 2015 12:49PM ET",VW says can bounce back as recalls 8.5 million EU cars,nan,"By Jan Schwartz and Andreas CremerHAMBURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) can bounce back from the scandal over its rigging of diesel emissions tests in two to three years, its new CEO predicted on Thursday, as the carmaker outlined plans to recall 8.5 million affected vehicles in the European Union.Matthias Mueller, who took the helm last month after Europe's biggest automaker admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests, said the German company needed to give more power to its brands and regional operations while working to get to the bottom of the biggest business scandal in its history. ""We have a good chance of shining again in two to three years,"" he said in a speech to Volkswagen managers in Leipzig.Volkswagen has said up to 11 million vehicles worldwide could contain banned software that allows them to know when they are being tested and temporarily reduce toxic emissions. The German company said on Thursday it would recall around 8.5 million vehicles affected in the European Union following an order from Germany's KBA automotive watchdog, which is taking the lead for other national EU regulators.Volkswagen had said previously there were around 8 million vehicles affected in the EU. A spokesman said it was recalling a further 500,000 ""voluntarily,"" but did not know whether they might also contain the cheat software. The KBA said the recall, involving 2.4 million vehicles in Germany, should start at the beginning of next year and would be mandatory, meaning drivers do not get to chose whether or not to bring in their cars and vans for servicing. A recall of all 11 million vehicles would be among the biggest in history by a single automaker, similar in scale to Toyota's 2009-2010 recall of more than 10 million vehicles over acceleration problems, though dwarfed by the number recalled by multiple carmakers due to faulty Takata air bags.Some analysts have said the scandal could cost Volkswagen as much as 35 billion euros ($40 billion) to cover vehicle refits, regulatory fines and lawsuits. Prosecutors in Italy said on Thursday they were investigating local managers at Volkswagen and its Lamborghini sports car business for alleged fraud.Nearly four weeks after it publicly admitted to rigging U.S. emissions tests, Volkswagen is under pressure to identify those responsible. It has been criticized by politicians, investors and consumers for the time it is taking to produce answers.Two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday the company had suspended Falko Rudolph, who oversaw the development of diesel engines between 2006 and 2010, as part of its investigation into the wrongdoing, which has already seen three top engineers suspended. FUTURE OF DIESELThe scandal has wiped around a quarter off Volkswagen's stock market value, forced out its long-time CEO and rocked the global auto industry and German establishment. ""We will significantly streamline structures, processes and (decision-making) bodies. We must become leaner and take decisions more rapidly,"" Mueller said of his recovery plan.""Our competitors are only waiting for us to fall behind on technology matters because we are so preoccupied with ourselves. But we won't let that happen,"" he added. German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said on Thursday the government should think about ending tax breaks for diesel cars and promoting electric ones, though she later said higher taxes for diesel vehicles were not on the agenda.Tax breaks have given a big boost to diesel vehicles in Europe, where they account for about a half of sales compared with just a small fraction in the United States. Abolishing them could have business implications for European carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), as well as Volkswagen. France said on Wednesday it planned to reduce a tax break on diesel fuel.German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the KBA had given Volkswagen until the end of the month to come up with a plan for a software fix needed for 2.0 liter vehicles affected by the recall.The carmaker has until the end of November to come up with a technical solution for 1.6 and 1.2 liter vehicles, he added.Volkswagen has said it aims to complete a refit of all affected vehicles by the end of 2016, with some requiring more complex and expensive changes to hardware. Germany had previously said 2.8 million Volkswagen vehicles were affected by the scandal in the country. Dobrindt said only 2.4 million needed to be recalled because the other 400,000 were no longer on the roads. He reiterated the affected vehicles were safe and could be driven as normal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1147,"Oct 14, 2015 09:29PM ET",Exclusive: Canada's Linamar in talks to buy French auto-parts maker Montupet,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Arno SchuetzeLONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts manufacturer  Linamar Corp  (TO:LNR) is in talks to buy French peer  Montupet  (PA:MNTP) in a deal that values the company at roughly 800 million euros ($914.96 million), two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Montupet is working with U.S. investment bank Jefferies to negotiate a deal, the sources said, cautioning that no transaction was certain and talks could still fall through. Linamar and Jefferies declined to comment while Montupet, the supplier of aluminum products to  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), was not immediately available for comment.If the deal goes ahead, it would be the latest transaction carried out by a Canadian firm in Europe after Magna International Inc bought Germany's car parts maker Getrag for 1.75 million euros in July. It would also show that the scandal over Volkswagen cheating pollution emissions tests has not eroded confidence among industry players seeking to expand in Europe.Montupet said in September that it had not been affected by the problems faced by Volkswagen, since it supplies Audi-brand V6 cylinder heads to Volkswagen, which are not linked to antipollution standards. Based in Clichy, on the outskirts of Paris, Montupet serves a number of international carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA), BMW (DE:BMWG), General Motors (N:GM) and Ford (N:F).It employs more than 3,200 people and has a market capitalization of 668 million euros.Earlier this year its management team, who owns around 37 percent of the company, expressed interest in selling their stake to an industrial partner active in the automotive industry and familiar with light-metal casting.Analysts at Hamburg-based investment bank Berenberg said Montupet, led by the 64-year old CEO and chairman Stephane Magnan, was seeking a tie-up with an industry player as a way to expand into China.Magnan has 11.69 percent of the company while executive managing directors Marc Majus and Didier Crozet, aged 67 and 66, respectively, own a combined 20.49 percent of the company.Linamar, with a market cap of about $3.7 billion, has often used mergers and acquisitions to boost its international footprint.Last year, it acquired a majority stake in Germany's auto-parts supplier Seissenschmidt.A tie-up with Montupet would help it compete with larger industry rivals including Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen which swallowed U.S. rival TRW Automotive Holdings in 2014 to create the world's second-largest automotive supplier by sales. In addition to France, Montupet is present in other European countries including Belgium and Spain, as well as the United States, India and Mexico. In 2014, Montupet had revenues of 451.8 million euros and core earnings of 91.8 million euros.($1 = 0.8744 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1148,"Oct 13, 2015 10:36AM ET",VW looks to cutbacks and electric cars to overcome scandal,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan SchwartzBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) will cut investment plans at its biggest division by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year and step up development of electric vehicles, it said on Tuesday, as it battles to cope with the fallout from its cheating of diesel emissions tests. The German company also said it would speed up cost cutting at the VW division, its largest by revenues, and put only the latest and ""best environmental technology"" in diesel vehicles. Europe's largest carmaker is battling the biggest business crisis in its 78-year history after admitting last month it installed software in diesel vehicles to deceive U.S. regulators about the true level of their toxic emissions. The scandal has wiped about a quarter off its market value, forced out its long-time chief executive and rocked both the global car industry and the German economy.Germany's ZEW think tank said on Tuesday its economic sentiment index had plummeted to its lowest level in a year, in part because of the uncertainty surrounding the auto industry, which employs more than 750,000 people in the country and is a major source of export income.Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he did not think Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) problems would do lasting damage to Europe's largest economy, however.Some analysts said a strategy more focused on electric vehicles and hybrids could eventually help sow the seeds of recovery for Volkswagen. ""There is a real chance for VW to even extract something positive from the diesel fiasco,"" said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.""Funneling more resources into electric mobility gives them a credible future perspective to try to overcome this crisis.""But the company has a mountain to climb. Volkswagen sources told Reuters on Friday its namesake division would probably slump to a loss this year because it was set to shoulder the bulk of costs related to the scandal. The company has said it may have to refit up to 11 million diesel vehicles that could contain cheat software, with around 5 million of those from the VW brand.Some analysts have said the group could ultimately face a bill of as much as 35 billion euros for refitting vehicles, regulatory fines, lawsuits and other costs.At 1310 GMT, Volkswagen shares were down 3.5 percent at 104.75 euros.SAVING MONEYVolkswagen will cut spending on models, technology and production facilities at the VW brand by 1 billion euros a year through 2019 from its previous plans, a spokesman said.He declined to say what those investment plans had been.Last November, Volkswagen announced 85.6 billion euros of investments across the group between 2015 and 2019, with half earmarked for modernizing and expanding the model range.Other brands within the group, which includes Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda, are reviewing spending commitments, the spokesman said, without giving details. Volkswagen said last year it planned to increase cost savings at the VW division, where profit margins lag much of the rest of the group as well as major rival Toyota, to 5 billion euros a year by 2017. On Tuesday, the division said it would speed up those cuts and stop making the money-losing Phaeton luxury saloon, a pet project of former chairman Ferdinand Piech that has never met its original sales target of 20,000 cars a year.The next-generation Phaeton, due to hit showrooms by about 2019-2020, will only be offered as an electric vehicle, it said.ELECTRIC CARSAnalysts have warned Volkswagen's problems could cast a shadow over the entire diesel vehicle industry. Although other carmakers do not appear to have used so-called defeat device software to cheat emissions tests, the scandal has highlighted differences between laboratory results and the on-road emissions of cars and vans often marketed to buyers as cleaner alternatives to using gasoline.Tighter rules are being introduced that could hit the competitiveness of diesel vehicles. That would be a particular blow for manufacturers in Europe, where around a half of new car sales are diesels versus a small fraction in the United States.Volkswagen said on Tuesday it would expand its so-called MQB modular platform -- the base for virtually all of the group's small and medium front-wheel-drive family models -- to focus more strongly on long-range plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles with a range of up to 300 km (186 miles).The MQB platform uses a large number of common parts across its range of models and brands, allowing it to assemble vehicles more quickly and at lower costs. The company has said it wants to increase MQB-based vehicle output to 7 million cars by 2018 from about 2 million last year. Volkswagen sold 10.1 million vehicles in total last year.While MQB is capable of hosting all types of powertrains including diesel, gasoline and fully-electric vehicles, Volkswagen said on Tuesday it would also develop a new modular platform dubbed MEB for compact electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The standardized system will serve as the basis for models with an all-electric range of 250-500 km, it said.At the Frankfurt auto show last month, Volkswagen said it would launch 20 battery-powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles by the end of the decade, including the first all-electric Porsche ""Mission E"" and Audi's e-tron Quattro concept unveiled at the show.Even after Tuesday's cuts, Volkswagen's investment spending dwarfs that of most major rivals, making it potentially better placed to bounce back from any hit to the diesel market.Exane analysts estimate Volkswagen will spend 11.9 billion euros on development this year, 65 percent more than Fiat,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Peugeot combined.($1 = 0.8795 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Nikkei did not say where it obtained the information.Officials at Nissan and Renault were not immediately available for comment.A source close to the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Renault was planning to hold a board meeting to discuss its alliance with Nissan.The French government in April raised its stake in Renault to 19.7 percent from 15 percent in a move it said was intended to boost its voting rights and protect its position as a key shareholder. Renault and Nissan objected, saying it could damage the alliance.The 16-year-old Franco-Japanese alliance has been viewed as one of the few partnerships that worked in the auto industry.Since Renault rescued Nissan from bankruptcy in 1999, the Japanese carmaker has outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of their combined 8 million vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit. Nissan holds 15 percent of Renault but has no voting rights.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1153,"Oct 02, 2015 01:20PM ET",VW rivals risk bigger blow as emissions scandal hits diesel,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume, Barbara Lewis and Laurence FrostPARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Volkswagen's cheating on emissions tests has soured the European car industry's heavy bet on diesel, with  Renault  (PARIS:RENA), Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) potentially facing bigger long-term setbacks than the company that sparked the crisis. In the face of that perceived injustice, tensions are mounting behind the united facade that European manufacturers present to regulators, some of their representatives say.VW's use of a banned ""defeat device"" has drawn scrutiny of more widely practiced test manipulation which, although legal, has allowed real-world nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to surge to more than seven times their European limits.A renewed push to close EU test loopholes promises to add billions of euros to diesel engine costs already at the limit of mass-market viability, hitting small-car brands hardest while shifting demand to hybrids, where the Europeans are several years behind Japanese competitors.""This VW tidal wave will accelerate the shift,"" said a senior executive at a French supplier of diesel emissions technology. ""Some carmakers aren't ready for this.""In the near term, VW will continue to suffer the worst repercussions of its test-rigging, exposed by U.S. authorities on Sept. 18. The carmaker may raise new capital, a company source told Reuters on Thursday, if the costs of recalling millions of vehicles, fines and lawsuits far exceed the 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) it has set aside.But when the diesel soot eventually settles, smaller victims may turn out to be more critically injured.The blackening of diesel, whose superior fuel-economy has been crucial to meeting ever-tougher carbon emissions rules, may force carmakers to spend billions fixing their NOx problem, and billions more to bring forward rechargeable hybrids.The average CO2 limit for European carmakers' fleets will fall from 130 grammes per kilometer to 95 grammes in 2021 -- a goal carmakers say cannot be met if diesel sales fall significantly.The industry now faces a hefty bill just to ""commercialize technology that may have a limited long-term future"",  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said. ""On top of this, they have the burden of developing alternative powertrains at the same time.""Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believes a regulatory crackdown could add 300 euros per engine to diesel costs that are already some 1,300 euros above their petrol equivalents, as carmakers race to bring real NOx emissions closer to their much lower test-bench scores.That threatens the very existence of small diesel cars, which currently account for about 60 percent of European sales by PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, and 40 percent of Fiat's. Premium and larger models -- a bigger part of VW's sales -- can more easily absorb the extra outlay and still turn a profit.All four carmakers declined to comment on the longer-term impact of the emissions scandal.In a letter to EU policymakers this week, the industry's main Brussels lobby group insisted that significant progress on NOx was impossible before 2019.Behind the scenes, however, divisions have emerged over plans for tougher real-world tests, with Peugeot and Renault aggrieved to be sharing public blame for German foot-dragging.""There is now unanimous backing for the tests among mid-market carmakers, but not with the Germans,"" a French industry source said. ""The sense of injustice is real.""Even before the scandal, new Euro 6 engine standards were set to add as much as 600 euros per car in costs from which customers see no obvious benefit, Renault-Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told Reuters in an interview last week.""No consumer is willing to pay (the extra) 500-600 euros,"" he said.The conundrum reflects the magnitude of diesel's rise since 1990, when it powered 14 percent of European cars. Helped by tax breaks, it now claims more than half of the market.But the fuel had already lost some ground after the World Health Organisation declared it cancer-causing in 2013, prompting London and Paris to announce restrictions. NOx and particulates are blamed for many thousands of deaths each year.""We expect research and development investments to increase further as manufacturers face new and more stringent rules,"" said Emmanuel Bulle, a director at credit ratings agency Fitch.Abrupt changes to engine programs, which often take two decades to pay off, may ""lead to material investment writedowns"", he added in a note.DEEPEST POCKETSThat is particularly sobering for Paris-based Peugeot, which depends on Europe for 60 percent of its global sales.Carlos Tavares, who took the helm after a brush with bankruptcy last year, has said Peugeot must show it can survive alone if only to strengthen its hand in likely consolidation.Without a partner, Peugeot would struggle to meet sudden new investment demands to upgrade its diesels and rush plug-ins to market. Its current hybrids are large, costly and diesel-powered, with rechargeable petrol-electrics not due before 2019.Like the 1973 oil price shock, which upended the global auto market and gave fuel-efficient Japanese models a U.S. foothold, the diesel scandal may benefit Toyota and Honda, world leaders in affordable plug-in hybrids.Soon after Ghosn's 1999 arrival from parent Renault, Nissan shelved its hybrid plans to focus on battery-only cars -- so far a mass-market flop -- and is now the only major Japanese carmaker without its own rechargeable hybrids. A revived program will launch plug-ins around 2018.""Renault may have made a strategic error in betting entirely on electric vehicles over hybrids and its exposure to diesel is the highest of any global manufacturer,"" Exane  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) analyst Stuart  Pearson  (LONDON:PSON) said.""Longer term, on the other side of this mess, VW has the stronger price point and margins to pay for plug-ins,"" said Pearson, who expects European hybrid sales to pick up swiftly from their current 2.2 share of the market and overtake a declining diesel in the next decade.The diesel fallout also challenges Fiat Chrysler, which has no plans for mass-market hybrids. CEO Sergio Marchionne regularly jokes about selling battery-powered Fiat 500s at a loss to satisfy California regulators. http://reut.rs/1nvo08nAlong with Renault and GM's Opel, Fiat relies heavily on Lean NOx Trap (LNT) technology whose real-world emissions are a larger multiple of legal limits, and harder to fix, than the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) exhausts prevalent in Peugeots. VW models are more evenly split between the two.While financial claims against the disgraced German giant will complicate immediate investment decisions, its Audi premium division and sheer overall scale bring advantages in the scramble for electrification.The group, which is about to launch a third rechargeable hybrid for its core VW brand, will spend 11.9 billion euros on development this year, according to Exane, or 65 percent more than Fiat, Renault and Peugeot combined.That is enough to persuade small VW shareholder Achim Hellmann, a self-employed marketing advisor from Hamburg, to take the long view on a stock down 43 percent since the scandal broke.""The scandal is terrible for the brand but I believe in their stance on future technologies,"" said Hellmann, 54. ""VW spends more on R&D than any other firm in Europe. Why should I sell?""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

If it turns negative, it would be the first fall since the market took off in the late 1990s.The gap between official growth figures and the situation on the ground in many sectors is posing a headache for some local executives who say headquarters use GDP data to set revenue and profit targets.A China-based executive in the heavy machinery industry said orders at his firm and affiliates were down about 50 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of the sluggish real estate market, and he had his work cut out getting that message across to head office.""I am now increasingly sending news articles that highlight weaknesses in the economy to HQ to make them understand our situation.""(Additonal reporting by John Ruwitch and the Shanghai newsroom, Joe White in NEW YORK and Kevin Yao in BEIJING; Editing by Will Waterman)"
1155,"Sep 22, 2015 05:31PM ET","Volkswagen says 11 million cars hit by scandal, probes multiply",nan,"By Andreas CremerBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said a scandal over falsified U.S. vehicle emission tests could affect 11 million of its cars worldwide as investigations of its diesel models multiplied, heaping fresh pressure on CEO Martin Winterkorn. Volkswagen said it would set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) in its third-quarter accounts to help cover the costs of the biggest scandal in its 78-year-history, blowing a hole in analysts' profit forecasts.It also warned that amount could rise, saying diesel cars with so-called Type EA 189 engines built into Volkswagen models worldwide had shown a ""noticeable deviation"" in emission levels between testing and road use.The crisis has sent shockwaves through Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for ""complete transparency"" from a company long seen as a symbol of the country's engineering excellence. Winterkorn was due to have his contract extended at a supervisory board meeting on Friday but is now facing questions about whether he knew about the automaker's use of software that deceived U.S. regulators measuring toxic emissions in some of its diesel cars.""Winterkorn either knew of proceedings in the U.S. or it was not reported to him,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. ""In the first instance, he must step down immediately. In the second, one needs to ask why such a far-reaching violation was not reported to the top and then things will get tough too.""Sources close to Volkswagen's supervisory board denied a newspaper report that the world's largest carmaker by sales had brought forward a supervisory board meeting to Tuesday evening from Wednesday. Volkswagen's executive committee plans to meet on Wednesday to discuss the emissions test scandal and the agenda of a full board meeting long scheduled for Friday, the sources said.An earlier story in the Tagesspiegel newspaper - denied by Volkswagen - said the board would replace the 68-year-old Winterkorn with Matthias Mueller, the head of the automaker's Porsche sports car business.Winterkorn did not mention his future in a video message posted on the company's website in which he repeated his apology for the scandal, which involves one fifth of the light vehicles Volkswagen produced worldwide since 2009, according to auto industry consultant LMC Automotive.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday Volkswagen could face penalties of up to $18 billion for cheating emissions tests. The carmaker also faces lawsuits and damage to its reputation that could hit sales, and media reports have said the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal inquiry into the matter. In addition, New York and other state attorneys general are forming a group to probe the scandal, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.""No company should be allowed to evade our environmental laws or promise consumers a fake bill of goods,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.Volkswagen stock tumbled another 20 percent to a four-year low on Tuesday after some countries in Europe and Asia said they would launch investigations themselves. Preference shares were down 19.7 percent at 106.1 euros at 1500 GMT (1100 EDT).At the lowest point, the declines in the preference and ordinary shares wiped more than $30 billion off the company's market value.Volkswagen was challenged by authorities as far back as 2014 over tests showing emissions exceeded California state and U.S. federal limits but held off on admitting wrongdoing until regulators threatened to withhold certification for its 2016 diesel models that Volkswagen in early September.Volkswagen has spent $77 million so far this year on U.S. TV commercials lauding its ""clean diesel"" cars, out of $164 million budgeted for advertising thus far overall, according to iSpot.tv, a Bellevue, Washington-based company that tracks TV ads.Volkswagen has not made a decision on whether or not to pull its ads, a spokeswoman said. 'TOTALLY SCREWED UP'Winterkorn has built Volkswagen into one of the world's top-selling brands since he took the helm in 2007, with brands ranging from budget Seats and Skodas to premium Audis and top-end Lamborghinis and Bugattis.But he has also faced criticism for a centralized management style which some analysts say has hampered the company's efforts to address long-standing underperformance in North America. Workers in Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen employs over 50,000 people, were dismayed by the damage to the company's image. ""If Winterkorn knew of the manipulation, then he must go,"" said one staffer who works in human resources at the plant.There have been no suggestions so far that other carmakers have engaged in the same practices as Volkswagen. Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) have said the accusations against Volkswagen did not apply to them. But shares in those companies as well as rivals including  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) fell on Tuesday amid signs regulators across the world will step up scrutiny of vehicle tests, which environmentalists have long criticized for exaggerating fuel-saving and emissions results.The EPA said on Monday it would widen its investigation to other automakers, and French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Tuesday an EU-wide inquiry was needed too. Germany's Transport Ministry said it would send an investigative commission to study whether cars built at Volkswagen's headquarters complied with German and European emissions guidelines. Italy asked VW to prove the cars sold in that country do not contain the ""defeat devices"" at the center of the scandal, while Switzerland also said it would investigate Volkswagen's diesel vehicle emissions tests.The European Commission said it was in contact with Volkswagen and U.S. authorities, and it was premature to say whether specific checks on the carmaker's vehicles were needed. In Asia, South Korea's environment ministry said it would investigate 4,000 to 5,000 of Volkswagen's Jetta, Golf and Audi A3 vehicles produced in 2014 and 2015, and it could expand its probe to all German diesel cars if it found problems.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Recent data from China has raised the chances that third-quarter economic growth may dip below 7 percent for the first time since the global crisis.""If there is one carmaker that is not worried about the situation in China then it's us,"" Ghosn told the Journal du Dimanche ahead of the opening of the Frankfurt car show on Sept 15.""There's one advantage with China. When the government decides to do something, it does it. When it decides to relaunch the economy, you know that it's going to go all out to do it.""Ghosn also said that economic slumps in Brazil and China did not call into question the group's strategy of building up big presences in emerging markets.""It's precisely because these markets are volatile that you've got to be everywhere. If there's a few clouds in one place, you see an upturn somewhere else,"" he said.Ghosn added that the company was taking action to improve productivity until weak markets bounced back, which he said he had no doubt would happen in Brazil and Russia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Instead, rivals such as  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) are benefiting from rising sales.But India is still expected to be the world's third largest passenger car market by 2020, so global carmakers are shifting their strategies to boost sales and cut costs. GM has been on a cost-cutting drive for months. The company has moved its corporate headquarters in India to a different location in the same city, which saves it 50 percent in rent payments, adding up to annual savings of $500,000, Saxena said. The company also plans to launch 10 new domestically-made vehicles in India over the next five years in a push to double its market share by 2020 from 1.8 percent in 2014.""We need to have a more sustainable and committed business. It would take time and would be a combination of all the activities that we do,"" he said, adding that until domestic sales revive it will focus on exports.The company started exporting to Mexico from India this year, in addition to Chile, which will help push total annual exports for 2015 to 20,000 and it expects to double this to more than 40,000 at the end of 2016.In future, it could also look at exporting to parts of north and South Africa and some Asian countries.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1163,"Aug 26, 2015 09:37AM ET",Global carmakers re-engineer India strategy to grow sales,nan,"By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Leading global carmakers are reviewing their blueprint for India to boost sales and avoid more painful cutbacks, after struggling to win over consumers even as the market swings to growth and dominant local players begin to raise prices. Automakers like General Motors (N:GM), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) have over the past weeks announced hundreds of job losses. Some have already reduced output, and industry analysts expect more to come.Others, like Skoda Auto, part of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), are retreating to their roots - for Skoda, ""premium"" cars.""India is not the most easy market in the world to crack,"" Guillaume Sicard, president of Nissan India told Reuters after the company said it would cut ""hundreds"" of jobs at the Renault-Nissan alliance plant in south India. The Indian market is showing signs of recovery. After a return to growth in the year to March 2015, this year every month has seen sales improving.But the benefit is being felt mainly by India's dominant players like  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI). Maruti in July reported its market share was once again above 50 percent, its highest in more than a decade.Passenger car sales in India rose 5 percent in the year to end-March, but global carmakers Renault, GM, Volkswagen, Skoda and Ford reported a double-digit decline, industry data showed. In contrast, Maruti and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) sales rose 11 percent.Now Maruti and Hyundai, India's two best selling brands, are turning up the competitive heat - entering the one segment companies like Renault, Nissan and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) had dominated: sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).Maruti recently launched a sedan-SUV crossover and Hyundai, the Creta SUV.NO SALES SURGELured by a large customer base and low car penetration, automakers built large capacity in India expecting a surge in sales: India will be the world's No. 3 car market by 2020. Instead, they were undone by their lack of small models, a sparse dealer network and steep aftersales service costs.Nissan introduced its inexpensive Datsun-branded cars last year but failed to ramp up sales given a lack of dealerships in smaller cities, where demand for such cars is high.And consumers' hesitance to make big purchases during a sluggish recovery has made a bad situation worse.""They looked at India as one of the markets they need to be in, but India is a very different kind of market,"" said Abdul Majeed, automotive head at consultant Pwc.""They thought if they bring the car at a good price, people will buy. It is not just about the initial price, it is also fuel efficiency and the whole cost of ownership,"" he said.Nissan and Renault say they will compete with new models, especially small cars, and by growing their dealer network.GM, which announced plans to stop production at one of two plants in the country last month, is betting on 10 new locally-made models over five years.GM will ramp up exports as well, joining Volkswagen and Ford, which are also targeting the domestic market with new compact cars.For Skoda, plans revolve around launching three premium sedans in India next year and increasing the proportion of local engineering to drive down costs.""Multinational companies tend to operate the same way worldwide,"" said Skoda India Chairman Sudhir Rao.""We are trying to develop more of a hybrid approach between Asian engineering and European quality.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1167,"Aug 18, 2015 01:02AM ET",Falling ruble leaves Russian carmakers with nowhere to turn,nan,"By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack StubbsMOSCOW (Reuters) - A steep decline in the rouble has hammered Russian carmakers by driving up the cost of the foreign parts they rely on, forcing them to raise prices at home and making them uncompetitive abroad.After a decade of annual sales growth in excess of 10 percent, the Russian car industry is now a victim of an economic crisis fueled by lower oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis. Domestic car sales have halved from their peaks in 2012-2013 when during some months the country ranked ahead of Germany as Europe's largest car market by sales, and the eighth biggest in the world. It now ranks only fifth in Europe and 12th globally.The ruble's decline has pushed up Russian carmakers' costs as - unlike rivals in other leading carmaking nations - they heavily depend on imported parts, which they pay for in dollars and euros. Back in 2012-2013 the rouble was trading at around 30 per dollar; the current rate is about 65 - which effectively makes imported parts about twice as expensive.This has forced automakers to raise prices - a desperate move in a country where the economy shrank by 4.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015. Employers have cut staff and wages, while annual food price inflation is running at over 20 percent, leaving many Russians with little money for big purchases. A renewed drop in the rouble - it has fallen 15 percent against the dollar since the beginning of July and is trading near a new six-month low - is set to prompt more price hikes and further erode sales. ""If the rouble steadies at the current rate until the end of the year, then the market is set to decline by 28-30 percent,"" said VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov. ""But if the rouble continues to weaken, prices will rise and the market could fall by up to 35 percent.""'REACHING CRITICAL POINT'The overseas market also looks bleak. While a weaker domestic currency usually makes exports more lucrative, Russian carmakers' reliance on expensive foreign components has left them uncompetitive against rivals from the likes of Japan and South Korea who source the vast majority of parts at home.Russia's auto exports fell 27 percent to 49,000 vehicles in the first six months of 2015, year-on-year, customs data showed. The bulk of vehicle exports go to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations such as Belarus and Kazakhstan. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford (N:F) both import more than half of all parts used to assemble their cars in Russia. Even market leader  Avtovaz  (MM:AVAZ), which produces Russian brand Lada among other models, sources about a fifth of its production abroad. Stung by its low level of local manufacturing, U.S. carmaker General Motors Co (N:GM) quit Russia's ailing market in March.Russian authorities have introduced incentives to encourage carmakers to gradually start producing most parts locally, but the most expensive and technologically advanced parts such as electronics, engines and suspensions are still imported.  KIA Motors  (KS:000270), which produces Russia's second-most popular car - the New Rio hatchback priced at 460,000 rubles ($7,235) - has raised prices by 15 percent in the first six months of this year. In the same period, average car prices have risen 18 percent year-on-year to 1.16 million rubles ($18,420) and sales have fallen 36 percent, according to research group Autostat and the Association of European Businesses.""The devaluation of the rouble increases costs for manufacturers,"" said Yulia Dytchenkova, director of Mazda (T:7261) dealer Rolf Khimki. ""They are reaching a critical point where the further revision of price lists is inevitable.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1169,"Aug 17, 2015 08:14AM ET",Protesters demand compensation for China blasts amid chemical clean-up,nan,"By Megha RajagopalanTIANJIN, China (Reuters) - Hundreds of residents displaced by huge explosions last week in the Chinese port of Tianjin demanded compensation on Monday, as authorities worked to complete a sweep of the blast site for dangerous chemicals.The death toll from the two blasts last on Wednesday rose to 114, officials said. More than 700 people were injured and 70 are missing, most of them fire fighters, the official Xinhua news agency said.The explosions sent fireballs high into the sky and hurled flaming debris across the world's 10th-largest port, burning out buildings and shattering windows kilometers away.Xinhua said there had been another small explosion on Monday.As teams specialized in handling hazardous chemicals scrambled to clean up the site, Tianjin's deputy mayor, He Shushan, confirmed there was about 700 tons of deadly chemical sodium cyanide in the warehouse that blew up.""Most was concentrated in the core"" blast area, he said. Workers would finish a search of a 3-km (2-mile) perimeter to identify and clean up chemicals by the end of the day, he said.About 200 protesters gathered outside a hotel where officials were briefing journalists.""This is not a demonstration. This is simply our only channel to attract the government's attention,"" said Li Jiao, whose home was close to the blast site.About 6,300 people have been evacuated from around the site in the city of about 15 million and the gateway to China's industrial northeast.About three dozen police and military personnel blocked the crowd from entering the hotel. Some protesters chanted for the government to ""buy back"" their homes and others carried signs that read ""fix our homes, that's our demand"".There were no clashes.Another protester surnamed Li said he had taken out an 800,000 yuan ($125,000) loan to buy an apartment that was so badly damaged it was leaning over. He said his family would never live there for fear of health risks""Most of the people who bought those homes are young, white-collar workers like me. It isn't a small amount of money,"" he said.'FIRMLY PUNISH VIOLATIONS'Paramilitary police accompanied residents back to their homes to collect belongings, the People's Liberation Army Daily reported on its microblog.A man surnamed Zhang, whose apartment was about 600 meters from the warehouse and was destroyed, said government regulators bore responsibility.""They had one eye open, one closed,"" he said.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ordered regulators to conduct thorough checks on those who deal with commercial explosives, with a focus on storage, Xinhua reported.Any company found not to have corrected any irregularities would be shut and the ministry would ""in principle"" stop issuing new construction permits for industrial explosives factories. Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said the explosions could generate insurance losses of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, citing initial estimates from media.China's top prosecutor, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, has opened an investigation into the explosions.Deputy mayor He said officials were confident those responsible would be held to account but he did not discuss compensation.""We believe that the investigation team can determine the cause of the accident, in short order determine and firmly punish violations of law, and in this way ... give victims and the people a full explanation,"" He said.Officials said environmental standards were still ""basically guaranteed"" and there were plans to prevent rain from creating dangerous gases or spreading contamination.Global automakers are struggling to assess the damage to their vehicles at China's largest entry point for imported cars. Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_P) said about 2,700 of its imported cars were damaged.Industrial accidents are not uncommon in China after three decades of rapid growth.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We began good discussions to reach regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism and extremism,"" he said in a televised news conference.Opposition to closer ties comes from hardliners who cite France sending HIV-infected blood supplies to Iran in the 1980s, when Fabius was prime minister and Iran was at war with Iraq, and its relationship with Gulf Arab governments that are locked in a regional power struggle with Tehran.Images on social media showed protests against Fabius at Tehran's Mehrabad airport, and flyers depicting a bloody red carpet and the pledge: ""We will not forgive or forget.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1175,"Jul 28, 2015 12:17AM ET","GM, China's SAIC will develop small vehicles for emerging markets",nan,"By Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Tuesday it will invest $5 billion over the next several years to develop with its Chinese partner a new family of Chevrolet vehicles aimed at fast-growing emerging markets, in the process offering investors a fresh rationale for rejecting a merger with  Fiat  Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA).For the first time, GM will develop the foundation of a new, global family of vehicles in collaboration with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, the state-owned Chinese automaker that is GM's primary partner in China, the world's largest car market. GM and SAIC will engineer Chevrolet compact cars and sport utility vehicles that will go on sale starting in 2019 in growth markets outside the United States and Europe, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico. The $5 billion will cover GM's share of engineering vehicles and retooling factories, GM said. ""We are taking significant advantage of the global scale we do have,"" GM President Dan Ammann said in a briefing on Monday ahead of a planned trip to Brazil. GM is expected to outline this week investments in Brazil and India related to the project. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra earlier this year rebuffed a proposal from Sergio Marchionne, FCA's CEO, to consider combining the two companies to generate better economies of scale by jointly developing vehicles.The large-scale, small-vehicle project with SAIC is the clearest example yet of Barra's strategy of focusing GM instead on ""merging with itself"" by consolidating fragmented vehicle and engine programs within its sprawling global operations. GM's current stable of compact models, such as the Chevrolet Aveo or Onix, ride on mechanical foundations developed separately by the automaker's Korean or European operations. The new generation of such vehicles will use common components and sell at a rate of about 2 million vehicles a year. ""That's a pretty significant consolidation,"" Ammann said. GM currently manages a total of 26 different vehicle architectures. By 2025, GM wants just four.GM's new emerging-market vehicles will compete with low-cost models offered by the Renault-Nissan Alliance (PA:RENA) (T:7201), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and others. GM's strategy is ""not about a low-end vehicle,"" Ammann said. Instead, GM plans to equip new Chevrolets with features such as data connectivity, and engineer them to comply with emissions controls and safety technology requirements that are moving toward the same standards as markets mature, Ammann said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Formula E cars make little noise and are far slower than Formula One and cannot currently complete a race distance due to the limitations of battery technology, with drivers having to change cars.The arrival of DS, however, brings another major manufacturer into a series that is evolving and next year will allow teams to develop their own powertrains.

I have a long contract with the team. It is difficult but I had dinner with Dietrich on Saturday evening and we still get along very well.""We know we have problems but we just have to work through them and I am here to do that job.""Red Bull, winners of four successive driver and constructor championships between 2010 and 2013, have yet to feature on the podium this season.The relationship with under-performing engine partners  Renault  (PARIS:RENA) has been stretched to breaking point while Mateschitz has talked of falling out of love with the sport.At the Austrian Grand Prix, a home race for Red Bull, the team scored just one point after Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Russian Daniil Kvyat collected 10-place grid penalties for engine changes.Red Bull are fourth overall.Horner said changes needed to be made to enable Renault and Honda to close the gap on champions Mercedes and Ferrari while the rules should be simplified.However, he added that Mateschitz remained supportive of the sport despite the situation.""He's telling what he thinks. He ultimately is a fan, that's why he's committed so much of Red Bull's marketing activities to Formula One. The risk for Formula One is when someone like Dietrich starts to fall out of love with it,"" said Horner.""That's a big worry because we need people like Dietrich to be engaged.""He runs a multinational company and Red Bull does not exist because of Formula One...if Formula One isn't generating the return and the coverage for him then of course he's going to raise questions about that.""Red Bull run two of the 10 teams in Formula One, with Toro Rosso used to develop junior talent such as 17-year-old Dutch driver Max Verstappen.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

He is also chairman of the board at their Russian partner, AvtoVAZ (MM:AVAZ).Ghosn's pay, though high for Japanese standards, was dwarfed by the record-shattering compensation for his Softbank Corp (T:9984) counterpart, Nikesh Arora. The former  Google Inc  (O:GOOGL) executive made 16.56 billion yen ($135 million) in roughly half a year, including an undisclosed one-off signing bonus for joining the Japanese telecoms company in September.Among the 2,451 listed Japanese companies that had submitted their annual securities reports as of Monday, just 77 executives at 32 firms received more than 100 million yen in compensation, according to Tokyo Shoko Research. Ghosn, 61, is the top individual shareholder in Nissan, with 3.122 million shares, worth about $30 million at the current share price. Nissan reported an 18 percent jump in operating profit in the year ended March 31, and forecast a 15 percent rise for this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""I think we can provide engines to any of the teams that want to race.""As long as we keep control over the aerodynamic work on the car, I think there's going to be enough distinguishing traits between us and the competition.

""He's spent a lot of money, does a good job and has been fantastic for Formula One... he's always supported Formula One.""I know Mr Mateschitz very well. There'd be more chance of him pulling out if he was winning than losing,"" added Ecclestone.""It doesn't mean that because he's falling out of love that he wants a divorce.

Messi, Ronaldo, this is what people love to switch a TV on for,"" he added.""We've got a big chance here to keep Formula One like that, but it's not like that at the moment, it's a shame, they've dulled it down.""Webber said making cars five or six seconds faster was not enough.""The reference point that we now have is horrendous in terms of pace,"" he added.

However, Renault has warned that the government's move could damage the alliance.

1207,"May 13, 2015 07:52AM ET","Nissan sees profit gains on vehicle sales growth, cost cuts",nan,"By Chang-Ran KimYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Japan's second-biggest automaker, said it expects operating profit to climb 15 percent this financial year, forecasting vehicle sales growth in most regions and promising large cost cuts.That follows robust earnings in the year just ended thanks to big currency gains and the popularity of its Rogue crossover SUV and other models in the United States.It predicted currencies will work against it this year but plans to beat expected flat industry-wide vehicles sales with growth of around 5-6 percent in China, the United States and Europe. Cost cuts are set to add a hefty 110 billion yen ($920 million) to profit.Nissan, 43.4 percent owned by France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), forecast operating profit of 675 billion yen - 2 percent less than a market consensus estimate, due in part to the automaker's conservative exchange rate assumptions.Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn noted that sales were slumping in Brazil and Russia, while in China demand would be driven increasingly by price cuts. Worries have grown about price competition in China as a slowing economy continues to weigh on demand for vehicles in the world's largest single auto market. In a sign of the pressure, General Motors Co (N:GM), No. 2 by market share in China, recently cut prices on 40 models there.Ghosn noted Nissan had outperformed the industry with 20 percent sales growth in China through April, but said it would be watching pricing closely as rivals add incentives.""The market is getting more competitive, but I don't think it's going to be brutally more competitive than anything else we have seen,"" he said in an interview with Reuters. ""It's normalizing as an emerged market in which car makers are going to have to be smart, going to have to be quick and they're going to have to be competitive.""Ghosn would not be drawn into much further comment on the French government's move to raise its holding in Renault to gain a bigger say in its management, which he has said threatens the balance of the Nissan-Renault alliance.Legislation introduced under France's socialist government doubles the voting rights of longer-term shareholders in companies that do not explicitly opt out by a two-thirds majority vote. An opt-out resolution proposed by Ghosn, who also leads Renault, failed to gain the necessary votes last month after France raised its stake to 19.7 percent from 15 percent.Sources have said that Nissan representatives on the Renault board have warned the Japanese automaker could be forced to take steps to increase its influence.""There is nothing more to add,"" Ghosn said. ""In a certain way, this is, for the moment, much more a Renault issue and Nissan is supporting Renault in this situation.""Operating profit in the year just ended jumped 18 percent, but in the final quarter it fell 13 percent to 171.6 billion yen - short of analysts' estimates - as the company adjusted for accounting changes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But with F1, wait and see. It's an option for Audi. Not at this moment, perhaps. But it is still an option.""There has long been speculation about whether Audi might be tempted into Formula One, but it has grown louder now that Ferdinand Piech has quit as chairman of parent company Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG).Piech was seen as being strongly against Formula One.Audi last year recruited former Ferrari F1 team principal Stefano Domenicali but not for an obvious motorsport role. They also made clear that the focus remained on Le Mans and the German Touring Car series.However, the return of Audi stablemate Porsche to Le Mans as a works team, and Red Bull's fraught relationship with engine partner  Renault  (PARIS:RENA), has also left people wondering whether a repositioning of brands might be in the offing.That talk was given further impetus on Monday when Red Bull motorsport consultant Helmut Marko, who is close to company owner Dietrich Mateschitz, sent what sounded like an open invitation to Audi.""If we don't have a competitive engine in the near future, then either Audi is coming or we are out,"" the Austrian told the BBC.""The VW Group first has to sort out...who will run the brand of VW, and when they have sorted all these things maybe then they can think about what they are doing in motorsport,"" he added.Red Bull have a contractual agreement to stay in Formula One until 2020, while their Renault contract runs until at least the end of 2016.The team, who won four successive titles with Renault from 2010 to 2013, have been vocal in their criticism of the manufacturer's V6 turbo hybrid engine, which has proved uncompetitive with Mercedes and Ferrari.Team principal Christian Horner labeled the season a write-off after Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, only the fifth of 19 races scheduled.However, he stopped short of saying Red Bull could quit: ""We want to try and sort the issues out,"" he said when asked directly whether leaving the sport was a possibility.

Everything worked out: the car was great, nailed the setup for the race, for qualifying. Everything came together,"" Rosberg told reporters after the ninth win of his Formula One career and third Mercedes one-two of the season. ""That still we are dominating in such a way is fantastic to see,"" he added.Hamilton now has 111 points to Rosberg's 91, with 14 races remaining and Monaco -- where the German has won for the past two years -- next up.After parking his car alongside Rosberg's, Hamilton shook the German's hand and patted him on the back in recognition of a job well done.His race engineer had told the champion, who made three stops to Rosberg's two after losing time with a slow first one, to resign himself in the closing laps on a circuit where overtaking is famously difficult.""I don't think it would be possible with the remaining laps, we'd be better just looking after this one, let him have it (the victory),"" Hamilton was told.""Is it impossible?,"" the Briton replied, with the engineer's reply confirming that there was no hope: ""He is going to respond if we pick the pace up. It would be impossible."" Hamilton agreed that it had been a simple case of damage limitation.""I had quite a poor start, it's been quite a time since I had such a bad start,"" he added.WRITE-OFFVettel, who had seized second place into the first corner, was happy to finish third but frustrated to see Mercedes still so far away.""I'm not happy with the gap (to the front), not happy at all,"" said the four-times world champion despite his fourth podium appearance of the year.The victory was Rosberg's first since Brazil in November and made him the ninth different winner in the last nine years at the Circuit de Catalunya.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen found himself in a Williams sandwich, finishing fifth behind fellow Finn Valtteri Bottas and ahead of Brazilian Felipe Massa.Daniel Ricciardo was seventh but lapped for Red Bull, with team principal Christian Horner effectively writing off the season for the former champions thanks to ongoing problems with the  Renault  (PARIS:RENA) engine's reliability and performance. [L3N0Y10BZ].""I think we are nowhere near winning a grand prix,"" added Horner.Romain Grosjean was eighth for Lotus, while team mate Pastor Maldonado retired with a broken rear wing, and Spanish rookie Carlos Sainz scored points at home with ninth place for Toro Rosso.The final point went to Red Bull's Russian Daniil Kvyat, who was cleared by stewards for a defensive move on Sainz.McLaren's Fernando Alonso, who had hoped for his team's first points of the year, retired after 28 laps with a brake problem that caused him to overshoot his pitstop as the jack mechanic leapt out of the way.His team mate Jenson Button finished but said the race ranked among the scariest of his career and questioned whether McLaren would score this season.""The first 30 laps...were the scariest laps of my life,"" he declared.Alonso's lack of success with his new team, after five years at Ferrari, and the economic situation in Spain were blamed for empty seats earlier in the weekend but organizers said 86,700 turned up on Sunday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

You have just got to go for it, even if you end up using 20 engines,"" said Horner.""It would be better to learn and make progress in preparation for next year than be conservative. It is far easier to make a fast engine reliable than it is to make a reliable car fast. Our philosophy has always been to push performance.""It is not enjoyable being in a grand prix like today when you are just going around, you're not really racing,"" he added. ""The determination is to get back. The frustration we have is that not all of it is in our hands.""Asked whether he was also writing off Red Bull's chances of winning a race this season, Horner indicated that was not something he was even thinking about.""I think we are nowhere near winning a grand prix,"" he said. ""You could see we got lapped today.

High-definition mapping has emerged as a key feature for autonomous driving and connected car services which could evolve into a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) say.HERE's high-quality maps enable automakers to offer premium services that Google (O:GOOG) maps cannot match.For example, their maps can be linked to a mobile phone signal in a way that allows parents to see exactly on which side of the school their children are waiting to be picked up - and the car can route the navigation system accordingly. They could also combine with real-time traffic information in a self-driving car to help customers get to work faster or spend more time writing emails on the way to the office.Daimler's Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber told German daily Handelsblatt in comments published on Friday: ""We are watching the situation closely. High-definition maps are a prerequisite for autonomous driving.""THIRD PARTY?While HERE has become increasingly distant from Nokia's core operations as it prepares to integrate its giant acquisition of telecom networks rival Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA), the Finnish company may still have an interest in retaining a stake.Nokia has hired advisors from Evercore to test the market for potential buyers and solicited a second round of indicative bids, a person familiar with the matter said.Although it remains unclear how many parties are competing, bankers say there is a rivalry between two categories of bidders: the industrials and tech companies. The auto companies cannot afford for HERE to fall into the hands of a player such as taxi app company Uber or Apple (O:AAPL), who may block their access to it. They also want to have a say in the development of the company Nokia bought for $8.1 billion in 2007 because they are HERE's largest customers.""We do care who ends up owning this business,"" an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Bankers say HERE is a natural asset for Apple, which has fallen behind in the area of mapping, although the Californian technology company has given no sign of being interested.With a market capitalization of $721 billion, the technology giant is worth more than Daimler, Volkswagen,  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), Ford (N:F) and General Motors (N:GM) put together.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""A little inflammation of my eye. They recommend not to be too much in the artificial light. I try to protect a little bit the eye today and tomorrow to be ready for Saturday and Sunday.""The last time Alonso appeared at the circuit outside Barcelona was in February, when he crashed heavily in the second of three pre-season tests.The medical advice that followed that incident was to rest and recover from concussion, meaning he missed the Australian season-opener in Melbourne.Alonso said he had no lingering concerns about that accident or getting back out on track and returned with full confidence and motivation.He also planned a thank you gesture for the hospital staff who had looked after him.""They were so kind to me and I plan to have dinner with them, probably on Sunday,"" he said. ""I stay here on Monday for one event with a sponsor, so Sunday night after all the stress and the race; more in a quiet place.""McLaren have had a stressful start to the season and their new engine partnership with Honda, qualifying near the rear of the field and failing to score in the first four races.At the last one, in Bahrain, Alonso's British team mate Jenson Button did not even get to start although the Spaniard finished 11th.""I think in Bahrain we had a nice step and that brought us closer to the Q3 (final stage of qualifying) and also to the points and we need another small step to reach that goal,"" said Alonso.""We want to be on the podium and win races but one step at a time and hopefully here in Barcelona we can see this step.""Alonso, twice a winner of his home race with  Renault  (PARIS:RENA) and Ferrari, said it was just a question of time and putting everything together before McLaren were competitive again.""I really think that we have the potential to fight with the top teams in future,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1213,"Apr 30, 2015 02:22PM ET","Renault vote puts ball in Ghosn's court, exposing rival visions",nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - The French government's move to tighten its hold on  Renault  (PA:RENA), crowned by a rare public defeat for CEO Carlos Ghosn on Thursday, has exposed competing visions for the carmaker and its alliance with Nissan (T:7201).Ghosn must now decide whether to fight or negotiate for closer Renault-Nissan integration, those close to him say, in the face of French determination to keep Renault in control of the alliance - and its own hand on the wheel.""I don't think he's going down without throwing a punch,"" one alliance executive who knows the CEO well said.Ghosn has long favored giving Nissan more clout to match its superior sales and profit, according to Renault-Nissan veterans who say he has tried before and may do so again.Seeking to increase its influence at Renault and other French companies in which it holds stakes, Socialist President Francois Hollande's government has introduced a law that doubles the voting rights on shares held for more than two years.Companies can opt out of the rule, but a resolution to this effect proposed by Ghosn failed at a shareholders' meeting on Thursday, falling short of the required two-thirds majority with 60.5 percent support.The result was no surprise. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron announced three weeks ago a 1.2 billion euro ($1.34 billion) share purchase to raise France's Renault stake to 19.7 percent from 15 percent, in order to block the opt-out.While the government has promised to pare the stake back to 15 percent, the ""Florange law"" still raises its voting weight to 28 percent, all but guaranteeing a veto on strategic decisions.Renault and Nissan both warned that the move would endanger their 16-year-old alliance just as global carmakers are increasingly competing on scale.At Renault's April 16 board meeting, Nissan also said any lasting increase in French government influence would prompt countermeasures, two sources have told Reuters.Macron, a 37-year-old former investment banker, has played down the power grab, repeating his ""full confidence"" in Ghosn. ""We're no interventionists,"" he said on Tuesday, citing his approval earlier this month for the sale of Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) to Finland's Nokia (HE:NOK1V).According to company insiders and French officials, however, the government acted partly because it feared Renault's ""Nissanisation"" under a new convergence push by Ghosn.On paper, Renault controls Nissan through a 43.4 percent stake, mostly acquired in 1999 when it rescued the Japanese firm from bankruptcy. Nissan has no voting rights on its 15 percent cross-holding in Renault.But Ghosn, 61, who heads both companies, has always given them decision-making autonomy, even at the price of missed cooperation opportunities such as their separately developed and loss-making electric cars. Nissan has meanwhile outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of combined vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit.FORCING THE PACEGhosn is now forcing the pace of integration by fusing production, purchasing and research and development under new alliance chiefs, all three of them Nissan managers. A Renault executive took a fourth post in human resources.""The Renault guys are worried that Nissan's engineering is taking over and we're about to be eaten alive,"" said Bruno Mathiez, an official with Renault's CFE-CGC union. The same anxieties have percolated through the finance ministry.Some observers now expect Ghosn to counter the government by restoring Nissan's voting rights in Renault. ""Many investors are focused on the risk of increased government involvement,"" said  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) analyst Kristina Church. ""We believe this may provide a trigger for Renault and Nissan management to review the current structure of their cross-shareholdings.""If Renault's holding is cut below 40 percent - through its sale of existing Nissan shares or the issue of new ones in a capital increase - the Japanese carmaker's voting rights could be restored under French rules.""It's hard to see why the government would want an entrenched conflict, or what there is to prevent Nissan from carrying out a capital increase,"" said another executive close to Ghosn, who expects a ""well prepared"" riposte.Ghosn has tried before to reduce Renault's Nissan stake, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter, notably during the global financial crisis in late 2008. ""Renault was short of cash and planned to sell some of its Nissan shares,"" one of the people said. ""Everybody agreed and it was all going ahead until someone in the Treasury remembered the 40 percent rule, just a few days before the sale.""The placement was stopped under ""friendly pressure"", and within weeks the government had announced 3 billion euro emergency loans to Renault as well as  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP).The source believes Ghosn will negotiate before acting unilaterally. ""A company like Renault needs to have normal relations with the state,"" he said.The room for compromise looks limited, after Macron said he saw no reason to let Nissan reactivate its voting rights and vowed to hold firm ""to the end"".But the clearest explanation of the government's stance came from Louis Schweitzer, Ghosn's former boss. ""I built the Renault-Nissan alliance according to a logic in which Renault controlled Nissan,"" said the top civil servant, who oversaw Renault's 1996 privatization.The government must ""ensure Renault keeps its roots and center in France and that the alliance maintains its original balance, with Renault in the driving seat,"" he said in a radio interview this week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1218,"Apr 23, 2015 11:42AM ET",Exclusive: France defends Renault stake increase in letter to Ghosn - sources,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume and Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron has written to  Renault  (PA:RENA) boss Carlos Ghosn to defend the government's surprise stake increase in the carmaker and reject claims it endangers the Renault-Nissan alliance.The April 21 letter was shared with Renault board members and interpreted by some as a warning against retaliation, two people with knowledge of its content said on Thursday.""What we are seeing is a real but silent struggle,"" one source said. Government officials confirmed only that Macron had written to Ghosn, declining further comment.France's stake in Renault and influence over Nissan, which is 43.4 percent-owned by the French carmaker, has long been a sensitive matter, with critics in the alliance and Japan fearing Paris might put its own interests above those of the businesses.Nissan holds a reciprocal 15 percent of Renault that is deprived of voting rights, another sore point in Tokyo, because Nissan is deemed to be under its alliance partner's control.France said on April 8 it had temporarily raised its Renault holding to 19.7 percent from 15 percent. Macron said the move would allow France to block Renault's attempt to opt out of new legislation granting double voting rights to longer-term investors, including the government.Ghosn's ""one share, one vote"" proposal to maintain the status quo will be put to the April 30 shareholder meeting, with a two-thirds majority needed to pass the opt-out.By blocking the resolution, the government would increase its voting weight from the previous 17 percent to about 30 percent -- close to a blocking minority -- even after paring back its capital stake to 15 percent as it has pledged to do.Since Renault rescued Nissan (T:7201) from bankruptcy in 1999, the Japanese carmaker has outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of their combined 8 million vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit.Renault last week urged France to back down from its plan to maintain increased voting clout at Renault.Following a board meeting, Renault warned that the ""survival and success"" of the alliance required the government's voting weight to be restored to its earlier level.Nissan officials also warned French board representatives that the Japanese company would take steps to counter any lasting increase in state influence, sources have told Reuters.In its first statement on the unfolding power struggle, Nissan said on Thursday its own board had ""unanimously decided to support the decisions made by the board of directors of Renault"". In his letter, Macron told Ghosn that France remained in compliance with 2002 agreements underpinning the alliance and could not be accused of destabilizing it, the sources said.Ghosn should not have been surprised by the stake increase, Macron added, because France voted against the opt-out proposal at a March 11 board meeting.""He makes clear it's not the government who is upsetting the balance,"" one source said. ""There is a warning between the lines.""The standoff comes at a sensitive time, as Ghosn pushes through an ambitious Renault-Nissan convergence program under a handful of recently appointed lieutenants, deepening unease among Renault engineers.Three of the four alliance-wide operational chiefs are Nissan executives, a fact that French officials also cite in conversations about the government stake increase.A Nissan spokesman would not say whether Thursday's board meeting had addressed possible retaliatory moves.Measures considered in the past to ""rebalance"" the partnership have included a Nissan capital increase or the reduction of Renault's stake below 40 percent. Either move could reactivate Nissan's voting rights in Renault.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1220,"Apr 21, 2015 09:42AM ET",Safran faces AGM heat as revolt over French Florange law widens,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firms are threatening to block key financial resolutions at French aerospace group  Safran  (PA:SAF), opening a second front in a battle between the French government and institutional investors over a new corporate law.The so-called Florange law is already at the center of a fierce debate over moves to introduce double voting rights for long-term shareholders in French companies to encourage stability.Safran has been able to sidestep the row over ""one share, one vote"" at companies such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) because it already has a system of double-voting for long-term investors that operates smoothly.But it is facing an investor revolt over a second, less publicized, provision of the law that grants more discretion to boards of French companies to repel takeover bids.Proxies representing big investors say they will vote against resolutions granting share issuance authority at Safran's shareholder meeting on Thursday, because they fail to suspend board powers to issue shares whenever a bid is imminent.Such share issues dilute a predator's stake and are seen by their critics as a form of ""poison pill"" that can hurt valuations. The government says clipping the wings of predators is part of its drive to focus on the ""real economy"".""Poison pills limit the powers of decision of shareholders and it is not up to the board to decide for them,"" said Hugo Dubourg, corporate governance analyst at France's Proxinvest.To many, the debate over Safran may seem academic: the maker of engines for France's nuclear missiles is already shielded by decrees protecting the defense sector from hostile bids.It's not the only company where proxy firms are gearing up for a fight over board authority to issue shares, with construction firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) also in the firing line.But Thursday's Safran meeting is seen as a potential test case for companies where the French state has a direct stake, setting the scene for a new clash over the Florange Law which groups a number of measures to make the economy less volatile.Safran and Bouygues declined comment.POWER SHIFTThe debate follows a fundamental change of French policy on the power balance between boards and shareholders during bids.Previously in France, the routine shareholder approvals allowing boards to issue shares were suspended in the face of a bid, under a principle known as ""board neutrality"".The term can seem misleading since boards have always been free to make their opinions heard, but until now they could not deploy share defenses without new backing from stockholders.Under the new law, a board can issue shares using existing approvals, even when a bid is imminent or under way. ""Before Florange, a board's hands were tied in the event of a bid and all powers were centralized in the hands of shareholders,"" said Hubert Segain, a Paris partner of international law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.""This was the opposite of the Delaware principle, which gives primacy to the boards of quoted companies in the United States.""In an effort to soften the impact, resolutions to be put before Safran's AGM would allow the board to issue shares during a bid, but would limit this to 9.6 percent of the capital.But firms like Proxinvest and French corporate governance association AFG want shareholders to be consulted on all takeover defenses as a matter of principle.Institutional Shareholder Services, the world's largest proxy advisory firm, has urged investors in French companies to vote against financial resolutions ""if they can be used for anti-takeover purposes without shareholders' approval"".Several French companies have added the limitation sought by proxy firms. Safran, in which the French government owns 18 percent, is the first state-backed firm to ask shareholders to approve the extra board freedoms set out in the new law.Despite opposition, some say Safran's proposed 9.6 percent ceiling could reassure investors that the law can be enforced without driving a wedge between shareholders and the board. ""It's not so much a poison pill as a dose of cough medicine,"" said one French financial source.(The story was refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 10)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1222,"Apr 15, 2015 01:15PM ET",VW struggle in 'diplomacy phase' as investors weigh CEO change,nan,"By Andreas Cremer and Ilona WissenbachBERLIN/STUTTGART (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) first leadership crisis in a decade has burst into the open with Chairman Ferdinand Piech's surprise public denunciation of CEO Martin Winterkorn -- but the standoff is now more likely to play out behind closed doors.Piech, 77, will meet cousin Wolfgang Porsche and other family members within days, company sources said, to discuss the rift his comments appear to have opened between their branches of VW's controlling clan.A full board meeting is likely to follow.""A phase of diplomacy will set in now,"" said one source. The company declined to comment through a spokesman.The turmoil at the top of Europe's biggest carmaker reflects Piech-Winterkorn tensions that have escalated in step with the chief executive's growing confidence, insiders say.It has also shifted attention from VW's growth ambitions to governance and performance problems, as challenges pile up and the earnings outlook darkens following a run of gains.VW shares edged lower to close at 242.70 euros on Wednesday, extending their decline since Piech's outburst to 2.8 percent. Any feud lasting beyond the company's May 5 shareholder meeting could prove more damaging.""Change is coming anyway,""  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) analyst Michael Tyndall said, with Winterkorn's contract expiring in 2016 and Piech expected to retire the following year, as he turns 80.A degree of strategic reassessment is to be welcomed, Tyndall added in a note, ""providing the resolution is speedy"".The last big intrigue to divide the founding family, Porsche's failed move to seize control of VW in 2008-9, dragged on for months and triggered years of investor lawsuits.Under the delicately balanced -- some say dysfunctional -- ownership structure that emerged, the Porsche and Piech families together command 50.7 percent of VW voting rights, with the state of Lower Saxony controlling a further 20 percent.In practice, strategic decisions also need support from German unions occupying half of the 20 supervisory board seats.Echoing his ruthless 2006 ouster of Winterkorn's predecessor Bernd Pischetsrieder, Piech opened the hostilities on Friday with a German magazine interview in which he confided that he was ""at a distance to Winterkorn"".His comments put an instant damper on expectations that Winterkorn would be reappointed as CEO beyond 2016, or else named to succeed him as chairman.At board meetings over the past five months, Piech has aired growing criticism of the company's performance under his former protégé, sources told Reuters -- particularly in the United States, where the VW brand has fallen far short of sales goals.Ballooning plant and investment costs are another concern cited by analysts, along with the lack of progress on a low-cost vehicle architecture to rival  Renault 's (PA:RENA) budget cars.Balancing these shortcomings, however, is the sheer pace of an expansion that has almost doubled group revenue and tripled profit during Winterkorn's eight-year tenure, propelled by roaring sales in China as well as acquisitions.KILLING THEM SOFTLYPiech met immediate resistance from VW stakeholders including Lower Saxony and labor chief Bernd Osterloh -- who said Winterkorn was ""one of the most successful automotive managers"" at the group and should have his contract extended.Wolfgang Porsche, who chairs the family holding, said his cousin's outburst was only a ""personal opinion"".Their reactions have led some to ask whether Piech is finally losing his grip in the final straight of a career spanning more than half a century.Concerns were raised in 2012 about Piech's judgment and VW's governance, following the appointment of his second wife Ursula, a former kindergarten teacher, to the board.But Piech, an engineer by training who transformed Audi from a struggling volume brand into a luxury car powerhouse, has ended several high-level careers with a few softly spoken words.Former Porsche boss Wendelin Wiedeking is among axed executives who discovered their fate in his public comments. And Pischetsrieder, like Winterkorn, initially commanded family and union support under fire, yet was gone within months.""My desire for harmony is limited,"" Piech explained in his 2004 autobiography.The Volkswagen patriarch, who keeps a dagger collection, has professed a fascination with Japanese military tactics in World War Two, according to people who have worked for him.""Piech is a fox,"" said one. ""He may now just wait tactically and wear his opponents down.""Among VW investors, even fans of Winterkorn concede privately that a new CEO appointment now looks likely.""The succession was bound to be tough,"" said one Frankfurt-based fund manager with a sizeable VW holding.""Winterkorn's track record is extremely convincing but if this impasse can't be solved in an orderly way, new management might offer the chance of a clean break.""The Qatar Investment Authority, VW's third-biggest shareholder, disapproves of the move against Winterkorn but believes he may now have to go, Handelsblatt reported on Wednesday.WELCOME CHANGEArndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with Evercore ISI, is less admiring of a CEO who has allowed investment to claim a larger share of sales at Volkswagen than at pure-premium rival BMW (DE:BMWG), despite his company's superior scale.""Almost every cost ratio at VW Group has increased and stands at a historically high level,"" said Ellinghorst, who now considers Porsche brand chief Matthias Mueller well placed to succeed Winterkorn.Piech's move ""forces the supervisory board to take a view,"" he said. ""Uncertainty is bad news for shareholders in VW. Change, however, would be welcomed.""Beyond or behind Piech's criticism of Winterkorn, some insiders also see signs of a personal animus against the CEO who has come to embody VW's rise in a way he once did alone.""A personality issue can't be ruled out,"" a VW source said. ""Piech can be very extreme.""Those tensions were in evidence in September 2013 when, on the eve of the Frankfurt auto show, an anonymously sourced newspaper report predicted Piech's imminent retirement due to ill health, with Winterkorn to succeed him.Piech turned up with Ursula at VW's lavishly catered media night, telling journalists that news of his death was premature.""Is this still your press officer?"" Piech asked Winterkorn as he crossed paths with the CEO and his spokesman at the event, according to Der Spiegel.Whatever their personal dynamics, bystanders are understandably keen to stay out of the crossfire. Even Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil, a board member, was keeping his head down when approached by Reuters on Tuesday.""The wisest thing to do at the moment is to say nothing,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1225,"Apr 07, 2015 02:32PM ET","Mercedes, Nissan expand cooperation to build pickup",nan,"By Edward TaylorFRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (XETRA:DAIGn) on Tuesday said it would expand its cooperation with partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd to develop a mid-sized pickup truck for Mercedes-Benz as the German premium automaker seeks to narrow its sales gap with rival BMW.The new Mercedes-Benz pickup targets commercial and private clients in Europe, Latin America, Australia and South Africa, and will share some of the underpinnings with an all-new Nissan NP300 truck, Daimler and Nissan said in a joint statement. ""Entering the rapidly growing segment of midsize pickups is an important step in continuing our global growth path,"" Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said. ""Thanks to our well-established partnership with the Renault-Nissan Alliance, we are able to drastically reduce the time and cost to enter this key segment.""Late last month Mercedes announced it will build a medium-sized pickup truck for customers outside North America, entering a new vehicle category which has been dominated by lower-priced brands.Mercedes, Nissan and Renault have shared engines, plants and vehicle underpinnings for small cars since an alliance was struck between the carmakers in 2010. Since then, collaboration has expanded from three common vehicle projects to 13.The Mercedes-Benz 1-ton pickup truck will be built by Nissan in Cordoba, Argentina, along with the Nissan NP300 and a Renault-branded truck, for Latin America, Daimler said. ""Nissan-Renault is going to invest $600 million in Cordoba to produce a new pickup,"" Argentine President Cristina Fernandez said during a public address in Buenos Aires, adding that the project will create 1,000 direct jobs.The three trucks will also be built in the Nissan plant in Barcelona, Spain, for other markets, excluding North America. Production of the trucks at the two plants will start by the end of the decade, the companies said. The Barcelona plant will produce about 120,000 vehicles annually for the three partners, while the Cordoba plant will produce nearly 70,000 vehicles a year. Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales arm is studying whether to sell a version of the proposed Mercedes pickup, Steve Cannon, head of the Mercedes-Benz USA said last week at the New York auto show. ""It wouldn't come until, at the earliest, the '18, '19 time frame,"" he said. ""We've got time to look at the market and decide."" Pickup trucks have gained popularity in recent months as gasoline prices eased. Last year, three of the four top-selling cars in the United States were full-sized pickup trucks, the Ford F-150, the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram 1500. The segment has been moving upmarket, creating an opening for a premium brand, Daimler said. A recent study by Truecar.com found 25 percent of Ford pickup trucks sell for $50,000 or more.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1230,"Mar 18, 2015 02:18PM ET",GM to shut Russian plant as sales slide,nan,"By Gleb Stolyarov and Maria KiselyovaMOSCOW (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) will shut its Russian factory and wind down its Opel brand in the country, taking a $600 million charge as it restructures its business to cope with a deepening downturn, the U.S. carmaker said on Wednesday.After several years of growth in excess of 10 percent, car sales in Russia shrank in 2014 as the economy weakened because of Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and a slide in oil prices.The rouble also tumbled last year, making consumers think twice about large purchases and manufacturers find ways to cut costs.The U.S. carmaker said it would stop production at its St. Petersburg plant which makes the Chevrolet Cruze, Opel Astra and Chevrolet Trailblazer models by the middle of 2015. The closure of the plant will mean the loss of 1,000 jobs.It will wind down the Opel brand by December and stop assembling mass-market Chevrolet cars at GAZ (MM:GAZA), a Russian vehicle factory, to concentrate on premium car sales.""This decision avoids significant investment into a market that has very challenging long-term prospects,"" GM President Dan Ammann said in a statement.Russia's Economy Ministry said late on Wednesday that no other foreign car company having an assembly line in Russia has said it would leave the market, RIA news agency reported. ""The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia cannot agree with the assessment of the market by one individual company,"" RIA cited the ministry's spokeswoman as saying.GM said it would take around $600 million in special charges related to the reorganization of the Russian business, primarily in the first quarter of 2015.Russia accounted for 1.9 percent of GM's global sales in 2014, down from 2.6 percent in 2013.RUSSIAN MARKET SHRINKSThe Russian car market is forecast to shrink by up to 35 percent in 2015 according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.. The Russian Economy Ministry said it expects the domestic car market to return to growth in 2016. ""The (growth) results can be undoubtedly achieved,"" the ministry said, adding that the government's so-called anti-crisis program aimed at supporting domestic companies as well as other forms of state support will help. But analysts say Russia is in for tough times.""At least 70 percent of cars currently sold in Russia are sold at a loss. Auto groups only stay in this market to protect their share in anticipation of growth,"" said Oleg Datskiv, general director of online automobile portal Auto-dealer.ru.GM said it would focus on the premium segment in Russia, which has held up better than the mass market, with Cadillac and some U.S.-built Chevrolet cars.Opel sold 912 vehicles in Russia in February, an 86 percent plunge on year-ago levels, said a spokesman at Opel's base in the German town of Ruesselsheim.Opel has raised prices several times to cope with the weak rouble, which fell more than 40 percent against the dollar in 2014, causing volumes to plunge and losses-per-vehicle to rise, the spokesman said.Compared to some other foreign brands, Opel is hurt by a low level of integration into the local market. It imports more than half of all parts needed to assemble cars there.By contrast, around 75 percent of car parts for Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201) vehicles sold in Russia come from local suppliers. This rate stands at about 60 percent for Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It could revolutionize racing and transportation in general,"" said Daniel Fernandez, 17, who bought tickets with several high school friends to attend the race, which is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators.The series was launched by Jean Todt, a French racing icon and former Ferrari chief executive who heads of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) that oversees Formula One.It is backed by environmentalist and actor Leonardo DiCaprio and entrepreneur Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group sponsors a two-car team.FIA, which has partnered with Spanish private equity fund Amura Capital, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and cable billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global Plc, has attracted sponsors such as tire maker  Michelin  (PARIS:MICP) and courier service DHL hoping the series will help the development of mainstream electric cars.""The technology improves unbelievably once these large companies start investing in research,"" said Pier Luigi Ferrari, the managing director of DHL motorsports.The public has shown an interest and Elon Musk's electric car firm  Tesla Motors  Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already built up a following, although its stock has fallen lately as it missed sales targets.Developing a so-called green racing series has meant overhauling how the races are run. Car batteries cannot be charged mid-race, forcing drivers at some point to rush into a second, fully charged car.The cars give off a high-pitched whistling sound, a bit like a dentist's drill. Drivers also must carefully manage their power, a challenge for race cars with a limited battery life.""We have a target (power) consumption per lap and we need to respect that like the Bible,"" said Jaime Alguersuari, a 24-year-old Spanish driver with Virgin.

He would be the first foreigner to become a Toyota EVP, the highest post to be held by a non-Japanese.Toyota also named Julie Hamp, a senior official at Toyota Motor North America, as a managing officer, making the American the company's first female executive. Christopher Reynolds, an African-American general counsel in North America, will also become a managing officer.Hamp's promotion marks a step in Japan's drive to narrow the gender gap in the workplace. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on corporate Japan to appoint women to 30 percent of top jobs by 2020 - a target widely seen as unattainable and opposed by the country's biggest business lobby.Women currently account for 11 percent of mid-to-senior level management in Japan and 1 percent of executive committee members, according to researcher McKinsey.NEW IDEASToyota has stood out for having few foreign executives - particularly compared with Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), led by Frenchman Carlos Ghosn - given that its home market makes up less than a fifth of its global sales.Currently, seven of Toyota's 57 executives are foreign. With the changes due in June, that number will rise to nine of 58.""We believe that discussion between people of various backgrounds creates new ideas and increased innovation,"" Toyota said, referring to the introduction in 2013 of its first outside directors, including American and former General Motors Co (N:GM) veteran Mark Hogan.Frenchman Leroy is currently a senior managing officer as well as chief executive of Toyota in Europe.

""I can't (give) you concrete numbers now but we have already started to work on how we can capitalize on the available capacity in Japan for North America.""Earlier this month, Nissan announced plans to tap alliance partner Renault SA's (PA:RENA) joint venture plant in South Korea to export more Rogue crossovers to the United States.With recent and upcoming model launches in the United States such as the Murano sport-utility vehicle, Maxima sedan and Titan pickup truck, Munoz said Nissan has ""never been as confident as we are today"" over its prospects in the United States, its biggest market.The Tennessee-based Spaniard also said there was no reason for Nissan to lag rival Honda Motor Co (T:7267) in the United States given its broader product range that includes a full-sized pickup truck and a bigger manufacturing footprint in North America. Munoz noted that Nissan is closing the gap with Honda also in key product segments where the latter has traditionally dominated with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), thanks to brisk sales of the Altima and Sentra sedans.""I'm confident we will overtake them,"" he said, declining to estimate a time frame.Nissan took 8.4 percent of the U.S. market in 2014, inching closer to its 10 percent goal for the business year to March 2017. But brisk sales have been driven partly by generous discounts and low-profit deliveries to fleet customers - both of which Munoz said Nissan was successfully beginning to rein in.Shares in Nissan have risen nearly 20 percent since the company announced third-quarter results earlier this month, partly on hopes for improved profitability in North America. The stock was down 1 percent midday on Friday, after hitting a more than seven-year high a day earlier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Further talks are due to be held next Monday.Greece’s current bailout is due to expire on February 28 and the new Greek government does not want it extended, fuelling fears over a conflict with its creditors which could trigger the country’s exit from the euro zone.Athens has proposed new economic reforms to replace 30% of its massive bailout deal, replacing them with a 10 point plan of economic reforms.However, Greece’s creditors in the EU are insisting that the country must stick to the terms of the original bailout agreement.Financial stocks were mixed, as BNP Paribas added 0.17% and Societe Generale tumbled 1.17% in France, while Deutsche Bank rose 0.21% and Commerzbank lost 1.25% in Germany.Earlier Thursday, Societe Generale posted quarterly profit below analysts' projections.Among peripheral lenders, Unicredit dropped 0.99% and Intesa Sanpaolo gained 0.73% in Italy, while BBVA dipped 0.04% and Banco Santander added 0.25% in Spain.Elsewhere, Renault (PARIS:RENA) surged 7.18% after the carmaker reported a 30% climb in 2014 earnings, exceeding analysts' estimates.On the downside, Hermes International (PARIS:HRMS) plummeted 1.41% after the French luxury goods maker forecast slowing revenue growth in 2015, as the weakness of the euro weighed on profitability last year.In London, commodity-heavy FTSE 100 inched up 0.01%, supported by gains in the mining sector.Shares in Glencore Xstrata rose 0.38% and Bhp Billiton advanced 0.79%, while Anglo American jumped 1.36%.Rio Tinto led gains on the index, with shares surging 2.18%, after the mining giant reported better-than-expected annual profit and announced plans to spend $2 billion buying back shares.In the financial sector, stocks were also broadly higher as Barclays and Lloyds Banking gained 0.30% and 0.48% respectively, while the Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC Holdings climbed 0.72% and 0.80%.In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a steady to lower open.

1238,"Feb 10, 2015 02:11PM ET","GM investor seeks board seat, $8 billion stock buyback",nan,"By Ben KlaymanDETROIT (Reuters) - Chief Executive Mary Barra's plan to keep a big cash cushion for General Motors Co (N:GM) is under attack from a group of shareholders led by a member of the auto task force that helped restructure the company during its 2009 bankruptcy. Harry Wilson, who was a member of the government-appointed task force, notified the Detroit automaker on Monday that he wanted it to spend $8 billion to buy back shares, and that he will nominate himself for election to the board of directors this spring. GM, which has 13 people on its board, disclosed the letter on Tuesday.""The company's common stock is substantially undervalued, the company is substantially overcapitalized and this repurchase of undervalued shares will create substantial shareholder value,"" Wilson said in his letter.GM shares were up 2.8 percent at $37.02 in the afternoon.Wilson, 43, said he had joined with David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and three other hedge funds: Taconic Capital Advisors, Hayman Capital Management and HG Vora Capital Management, which together own about 34.4 million shares, or 2.1 percent of GM stock. Wilson, who last May called GM's shares ""woefully undervalued,"" will receive a percentage of the group's profit from their investment in the company.While GM reiterated that it acts in the best interests of shareholders, the plan launched by Wilson and the funds is a direct challenge to the company's board. The company declined to make any executives or the chairman, Tim Solso, available to comment.Wilson intends to nominate himself as a candidate for the board at the 2015 annual shareholders' meeting and offer a proposal to complete the share buyback program within a year. GM traditionally holds its annual meeting in June. He also said he could nominate additional people to join the board, whose members are all up for election this year.Wilson, who notified GM of his intentions during a Feb. 3 meeting with Barra about unrelated issues, could not immediately be reached for comment.PICKING UP THE PACEGM has come under increasing pressure to return some of its $37 billion in liquidity, including $25 billion in cash, to shareholders. The company said last week it will increase the quarterly dividend by 20 percent, and that it has boosted capital spending plans for 2015, also by 20 percent, to $9 billion. Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told Reuters that more cash could be returned to investors as soon as the second half of the year, and GM wanted to maintain its cash on the high end of the range of $20 billion to $25 billion.Analysts said Wilson's proposal was essentially calling for GM to accelerate its pace of cash return to investors. Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said it is likely the automaker will implement some sort of buyback, perhaps for half the amount that Wilson's group is seeking.J. Kyle Bass, Hayman's chief investment officer, declined to comment, referring questions to Wilson. A spokesman for Taconic also declined to comment. Officials with the other two funds could not immediately be reached.Wilson, CEO of Maeva Group Llc which he founded in January 2011, said in the letter he has talked with other investors, but did not indicate whether they would support his efforts. GM said because Wilson missed the Dec. 31, 2014, deadline to submit a proposal for inclusion in the company proxy, he will have to issue his own proxy. GM said it has been in regular contact with some of the investors identified in the group as recently as Feb. 4, and that they did not indicate their intention to nominate directors. The company said its board will evaluate Wilson's candidacy and make a recommendation.PREVIOUS POWER STRUGGLESGM has been at the center of corporate power struggles before.In the 1980s, Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot, then GM's largest shareholder, started a war with then-Chairman Roger Smith which ultimately led GM to buy out Perot's shares in 1986.In 1992, GM's independent directors, guided by corporate governance expert Ira Millstein, deposed CEO Bob Stempel as the company careened to the edge of bankruptcy. In that case, board members led the coup, cheered on by investors.In 2005, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian bought a stake in GM, and later urged then-GM CEO Rick Wagoner to forge an alliance with the Renault-Nissan Alliance, run then and now by Carlos Ghosn. Wagoner and GM's board successfully resisted Kerkorian's plans, and he sold his shares in 2006.Three years later, GM was taken over by the U.S. government and restructured in a taxpayer-funded bankruptcy. Wilson was a member of a task force appointed by President Barack Obama to guide the overhaul.Today, the post-bankruptcy GM has fewer defenses against disgruntled shareholders than many other global automakers, which are shielded by either a strong family shareholder group – such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU), Ford Motor Co (N:F) and BMW AG (DE:BMWG) – or a significant government stake, as at Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Renault SA (PA:RENA).One of the last government entities to have a stake in GM, the government of the Canadian province of Ontario, sold its remaining shares in the automaker earlier this month. The Canadian federal government still owns a 4.6 percent stake in GM. The U.S. government sold its last shares in GM in late 2013.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

1241,"Feb 02, 2015 03:50PM ET",Nissan rejects U.S. government offer to mediate Mississippi UAW row,nan,"By Bernie WoodallDETROIT (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) has rejected a U.S. State Department offer to mediate a dispute between the company and the United Auto Workers over claims of anti-union practices as the UAW tries to organize workers in Mississippi.The UAW was joined by the umbrella labor group IndustriALL Global Union Federation last April in asking the State Department for its help.Even as the mediation would have been non-binding, the UAW's effort to include a global union group and the State Department is part of its ongoing campaign to turn public opinion against Nissan for what it claims are violations of workers' rights.The State Department said in a statement its role had ended because ""a voluntary mediation process could not be established since Nissan was not willing to participate,"" with the State Department's National Contact Point (NCP), which works to further the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's guidelines in the United States.""The NCP regrets Nissan's unwillingness to participate in the process,"" the statement, dated Jan. 30, said.The UAW has been trying for more than a decade to organize the Nissan plant near Jackson, and has said Nissan is using ""threats, intimidation and fear"" to keep the union out of the plant, which it says violate OECD guidelines.On Monday afternoon, a Nissan spokesman said by email that the company declined to participate in the mediation ""because long-established guidelines for bringing a union vote already exist,"" and are set by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board.""Nissan respects labor laws in every nation where it operates and works to ensure that all employees are aware of these laws,"" the statement said, adding that all Nissan workers have the ability to decide whether they want to be in a union.The State Department's NCP also has no power to judge disputes that it is asked to mediate.There are between 6,000 and 6,300 employees, including full-time Nissan and contract workers, at the plant in Canton, Mississippi. Nissan has an alliance incorporated in the Netherlands with French-based Renault SA (PA:RENA). Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan. The UAW said it may file objections to Nissan's behavior in Mississippi with OECD liaisons with governments in Japan, France and the Netherlands.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We have suspended taking orders,"" Ghosn told reporters at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama, saying the freeze is limited to specific models while orders already placed are being honored. ""We didn't do it (suspend orders) overall, just on some models we said, 'Sorry, until we see where this situation is going we don't take orders."" The Russian currency has tumbled about 50 percent against the dollar so far this year, putting pressure on automakers who have had to raise prices and contend with falling demand. Nissan has already increased prices on half of models sold in Russia by 5 percent to 8 percent. Ghosn said Nissan had hiked prices on models that use higher levels of imported parts. Russia is Nissan's fifth-largest market and the Japanese firm's alliance with Renault SA (PA:RENA), of which Ghosn is chairman and CEO, gives it a majority stake in Avtovaz OAO (MM:AVAZ), Russia's largest automaker. Ghosn, who said Nissan and Renault were gaining market share in Russia, wants to grow their combined market share there to 40 percent from about 35 percent now. The executive said he remained confident that the Russian market would ""stabilize"". Nissan this month announced plans to double production capacity at its St. Petersburg plant to 100,000 vehicles. ""The bad news is that the market is shrinking. This is bad news for everyone,"" Ghosn said. ""When the rouble sinks it's a bloodbath for everybody. It's red ink, people are losing money, all car manufacturers are losing money."" The automaker aims to raise production in Russia to 90 percent of Nissan cars sold in the country by 2016, up from the current 70 percent. Ghosn also praised Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's mix of economic and fiscal policies at the briefing. He said the now much weaker yen was no longer a ""handicap"", and the company planned to take advantage of the currency's drop and expand domestic production for exports.

1249,"Nov 05, 2014 11:30AM ET",Exclusive: Peugeot takes low-cost step with Moroccan outsourcing,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume and Laurence Frost PARIS (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen (PA:PEUP) will open an engineering center in Morocco with consulting firm Altran (PA:ALTT) in the first major step under new boss Carlos Tavares to increase the French carmaker's footprint in lower-wage countries, sources said.Peugeot will outsource some research and development functions to the new Altran center, creating 1,500 jobs, two people familiar with the plan said, as the carmaker weighs an eventual investment in low-cost vehicle assembly in Morocco.The site in Casablanca will specialize in computer-assisted design, modeling and technical documentation. The move could pave the way for an assembly plant to follow in the footsteps of French rival Renault's (PA:RENA) no-frills car factory up the coast in Tangier.""Morocco is on its radar,"" one source said. Moroccan officials are in ""serious discussions with several carmakers including PSA"".A Peugeot spokesman said there were no plans for a low-cost assembly plant and would not confirm the Casablanca R&D center. Paris-based Altran, an engineering services specialist, said there was ""no new contract"" with Peugeot, declining to respond to further questions.Peugeot shares rose following the Reuters report and were up 1.8 percent at 9.42 euros as of 1605 GMT (11:05 a.m. EST), valuing the company at 7.2 billion euros.The Moroccan R&D move is an important step for Peugeot as it seeks to regain competitiveness, and a symbolic win for the North African kingdom reflecting its growing industrial sophistication in sectors such as cars and aerospace.But any impact on jobs in France, where Peugeot is already reducing its engineering workforce, would be unpopular with unions and sensitive for the government.Heavily reliant on Europe for sales and production, Peugeot survived the region's six-year market slump only after a 3 billion euro ($3.75 billion) share issue that saw the French state and China's Dongfeng (HK:0489) take 14 percent stakes.MID-MARKETThe battering was worsened by Peugeot's dependence on the mid-market, where pricing and demand collapsed, while premium rivals and no-frills brands like Renault's Dacia fared better.The Peugeot 301 and Citroen C-Elysee are the closest thing the company currently has to a budget offering, built in Spain on the stripped-down architectures of pricier models.Its new Spanish-built C4 Cactus also signals a move by the core Citroen lineup into lower price points that may ultimately call for a similar shift on costs.""We can't sell cars in Turkey or North Africa that have been made in France or the euro zone,"" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said in February, adding that the bailout would help ""build capacity to serve regions such as the periphery of Europe"".Soon afterwards, CEO Tavares pledged to double component sourcing from low-cost countries to 40 percent while maintaining 75 percent of the group's R&D activities in France, where they employed 14,500 workers last year.Before the capital increase announcement, the French government had approved a new low-cost plant as part of the pitch to investors, an official source said.While the low-cost plan remains live, its timeframe has receded as Peugeot focuses on immediate restructuring challenges at home as well as a possible reopening of the Iranian market, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.With the French economy struggling and unemployment stuck above 10 percent, government sensitivities have been heightened by production plans that appear to leave Peugeot plants in Rennes and Poissy exposed to future cuts, sources said.A new low-cost production investment ""is not one of the levers in our recovery plan,"" Tavares told Reuters last month, refusing to be drawn further.

1251,"Oct 29, 2014 08:10AM ET",French drugmaker Sanofi sacks CEO Viehbacher,nan,"By Natalie Huet and Noëlle Mennella PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi's (PA:SASY) board ousted its chief executive of six years at a special meeting on Wednesday, two days after it emerged he had fallen out with the French drugmaker's chairman, wiping more billions off its market value.The management turmoil comes at a particularly awkward time for France's second-biggest listed company, after it warned on Tuesday that growth in its key diabetes business would likely stall next year.The board said on Wednesday Sanofi would continue the strategy of international expansion pursued under Chris Viehbacher, blaming his dismissal on his management style and poor relations with the board.But some analysts fear the company may become more insular.""Viehbacher tried hard to change the DNA of the company but the board won in the end. Sanofi will become more parochial now,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities in London.Shares in Sanofi were down more than 4 percent in morning trade. That takes their decline over the past three days to more than 15 percent, wiping almost 17 billion euros ($22 billion) from the company's market value -- or more than the entire market capitalization of French carmaker Renault (PA:RENA).Sanofi said Chairman Serge Weinberg would take on the CEO role until a replacement for the ousted German-Canadian Viehbacher was found. Weinberg said on a conference call there had already been contacts with potential candidates in the pharmaceutical industry and nationality would not be a factor.""We want to choose the best possible boss for Sanofi, so we'll take the time that's needed,"" Weinberg said, adding the board would strive to go ""as fast as possible"".UNANIMOUS DECISIONSanofi's first non-French boss, Viehbacher transformed a national champion into a global business, largely due to the $20 billion acquisition of U.S. biotech and rare diseases company Genzyme in 2011, which tipped the enlarged group's center of gravity away from Paris and towards Boston.But his straight-talking and sometimes brusque management style raised the hackles of trade unions, and a source close to the board told Reuters this week that it was unhappy at the lack of communication from an ""authoritarian, solitary, secret"" CEO.Viehbacher did not inform the board when he recently oversaw a review of what to do with an $8 billion portfolio of off-patent drugs in Europe, most of which are produced in France. The options studied leaked to the press and fired up tensions.Weinberg said the unanimous decision from the board's 15 members to remove Viehbacher stemmed mainly from his management style and poor cooperation. He also cited problems with Viehbacher's execution of group strategy, pointing to inventory problems in Brazil last year, a slowdown in sales in China and Tuesday's warning on its diabetes business.The fact Viehbacher moved to Boston in June did not help relations improve, but his change of residence was not the root of the dispute, one source close to the board said.Uncertainty over Viehbacher's role first surfaced on Monday with the publication of a Sept. 4 letter he sent to the board asking for clarity about his position.A source close to the matter said Wednesday's board meeting lasted only 30 minutes and was relaxed. ""Chris Viehbacher thanked everybody and said he respected the board's decision. He seemed prepared,"" the source said.French cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is Sanofi's largest shareholder, with a stake of 9 percent. Officials at the company were not immediately available to comment.M&A?Some investors were disappointed Sanofi did not set out a plan on Tuesday to offset problems at its diabetes unit with cost cuts. However, Citi analyst Peter Verdult said scope for significant cuts were limited by the need to invest in the new drug pipeline. It is also difficult for Sanofi to cut its domestic cost base in France, due to strict French labor laws.One lever Sanofi could pull would be to make further acquisitions, according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.""Generally speaking, in the pharmaceutical sector, larger M&A deals tend to happen when companies are in difficult straits and this is where Sanofi seems to be at the moment,"" he said.Sanofi has stayed somewhat on the sidelines of a global tide of mergers and acquisitions in the industry over the past year.Weinberg ruled out mega-deals, saying these rarely created value, but said the group would keep looking at targeted acquisitions to strengthen its existing businesses.""It's not because we haven't acted lately on this front that we won't do so tomorrow, but we are not interested in big operations, in what we call mega-mergers,"" he said.(1 US dollar = 0.7853 euro)(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris; Editing by James Regan, Andrew Callus and Mark Potter)"

1253,"Oct 02, 2014 07:40AM ET",Daimler cuts car market forecast as Europe wobbles,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Laurence Frost PARIS (Reuters) - German luxury automaker Daimler (DE:DAIGn) has cut its growth forecast for the global car market, blaming cooler demand in emerging markets and a plunge in Russian sales which has put a fledgling European industry recovery in jeopardy.Speaking as the Paris auto show opened to the media on Thursday, Daimler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said he now expected the global car market to grow by 3-4 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4-5 percent.Other executives shared his caution, particularly over Europe where a six-year sales slump has left demand around 20 percent below pre-crisis levels and sluggish economies have put a question mark over whether the gap will close anytime soon.""Perhaps we will arrive at 13 million or 13.5 million (overall vehicle sales in Europe). But the market won't return to (the pre-crisis level of) 15.5 million, I'm sure of it,"" Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said on the eve of the show.Europe's car market has returned to growth this year, although widespread incentives for buyers and government subsidy schemes in some countries have made it difficult to gauge the strength of underlying demand.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that car sales in Germany rose by more than 5 percent in September, bouncing back from a decline in August and giving a year-to-date increase of 2.9 percent.But demand has been erratic and executives are particularly concerned about Russia -- once tipped to overtake Germany as Europe's largest auto market -- where new car sales tumbled 26 percent year-on-year in August due to a slowing economy hit by Western sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.""Earlier this year, momentum was at the upper end of expectations but it's flattening out a bit,"" Ford Europe (N:F) Chief Executive Stephen Odell told reporters, referring to the broader European market.BMW (DE:BMWG) Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer, meanwhile, said price levels in Europe had improved, but not by as much as the German carmaker's managers would have liked.He forecast it would take more than three years for the European market to return to pre-crisis levels.LONG-TERM VIEWDespite their concerns, some executives said they were keeping faith with the Russian market, and in some cases sticking to sales forecasts.""The Russian market will come back. One has to think in longer terms,"" Volkswagen's Winterkorn said. ""It's right, we cut production (temporarily in September at the Kaluga plant) but Russia will come back, I'm convinced of that.""Toyota (T:7203) also said it expected to ride out the worst of the slump in Russia's car market, and stuck to its goal of increasing sales to a million vehicles in Europe next year.Didier Leroy, the Japanese carmaker's head of European operations, said that while sales of entry-level cars in Russia were down 25-30 percent, hurting many of its competitors, demand for premium vehicles was down a more modest 8 percent.Vehicles such as its Camry and Lexus have helped Toyota to boost its share of the declining Russian market by about 1 percent this year, he added.With carmakers scrapping for market share across Europe, the Paris show is packed with new fuel-efficient small cars and compact SUVs designed to tap into stronger performing segments of the market.Among the new models in Paris is Renault's (PA:RENA) revamp of the elderly Espace people carrier as a crossover sport utility vehicle. It was launched on Thursday 30 years after the first model was unleashed on European consumers who hadn't yet realized they wanted one.Once the European market leader, the Espace is now one of the laggards of its category, far behind the Ford (N:F) S-Max, which struck out in a sportier direction from its 2006 introduction and is unveiling another timely update in Paris.""It's a global shift affecting even family vehicles, and it is here to stay,"" Societe Generale analyst Philippe Barrier said. ""Designers are having to compromise as people look for something sportier.""Daimler's Zetsche said growth was also slowing in emerging markets such as Brazil and Argentina. But he played down fears of a sharp slowdown in China, the world's biggest car market.""Growth has slowed, but from a much broader base,"" he said.

1254,"Oct 02, 2014 05:50AM ET",Fiat needs more than the 500 to turn core brand around,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak PARIS (Reuters) - While rivals roll out new models and concept cars, Fiat has little to show at the Paris auto show besides another variant of its retro-styled 500 compact car, in what is starting to look like a worrying trend for the carmaker's namesake brand.Following the full takeover of U.S. unit Chrysler, the newly-named Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has set out an ambitious growth plan focused on its upmarket Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep brands.Analysts say it makes sense to concentrate on higher-margin premium vehicles that are selling strongly in the United States and emerging markets, but are concerned the group is neglecting a Fiat brand which still accounts for a large chunk of sales.FCA sold 1.5 million Fiats last year, with deliveries of the mass-market brand accounting for 34 percent of the group total.The 500X debuting in Paris should help lift sales by adding to the popular mini-SUV category. But the crossover car is unlikely to significantly change the face of Fiat's core brand, starved of models and stuck with an aging line-up.""The 500 is getting older and older, the success of its variants has been limited and they lack a competitive offering at a time when Volkswagen, Peugeot and Renault continue to launch new cars,"" said Sascha Gommel, an analyst at Commerzbank. ""Even if the European recovery was gaining momentum, Fiat would definitely lose out.""BUMPS IN THE ROADChief Executive Sergio Marchionne struck gold in 2007 when he chose the 500 hatchback to revive the flagging Fiat marque, selling more than a million in the six years after relaunch.Sold in more than 100 countries the Fiat 500 -- as Italian as a cup of espresso or actress Sophia Loren -- was meant to be Marchionne's answer to BMW's Mini and help drive sales of other models within the Fiat family.But a strategy that got off to a promising start hit a few bumps in the road, not least an economic crisis that pushed car sales in Europe into a six-year slump, from which the sector is only gradually recovering.European sales of the 500 are still high but have come down from their 2008-9 peaks, despite customized features and electric and cabriolet versions. A rise in buyer incentives in the United States and Europe to boost sales also hints at problems and risks devaluing the product, analysts say.Meanwhile, Fiat dealers say the 500 revamp has failed to rub off on other cars within the brand, some of which are looking tired. Fiat's Punto hatchback is already nine years old.""Mini did the classic rollout of keeping sales steady over the years by slowly and steadily introducing product variations, but Fiat is not that disciplined,"" said Jane Nakagawa, managing director at Portia Consulting. ""To the average consumer, the variations they have come out with were relatively invisible.""Fiat's global market share in the B-segment of small sub-compact cars has fallen from 9.3 percent in 2007 to 6.2 percent last year and is expected to dip below that level to 5.7 percent by 2018, according to forecaster IHS Automotive.In the city car A-segment, under which Fiat's popular 500 and Panda models fall, Fiat's market share is seen falling from around 7 percent to just under 5 percent between 2007-18.MOVING ONFiat needed half the time it took Mini or Kia to breach the 40,000 sales mark in the U.S. market, but deliveries there peaked in 2012, and fell 18 percent last year.The larger five-door 500L was hit by two recalls and the Serbian factory which produces the model was temporarily suspended last month due to ""market conditions"".""The 500L recall was a bump in the road and we are ready to move on,"" said Jason Stoicevich, head of the Fiat brand for North America. He said Fiat was on track to have its best sales year in the United States this year since the brand was brought back there in 2011, with sales through September up 8 percent. Stoicevich is betting on the 500X to speak to U.S. consumers who like sport utility vehicles (SUVs), are looking for something larger than a city car, and want a sturdier car with all-wheel drive capability to withstand harsher weather.""This is going to be a real game-changer,"" he said. ""It is the first vehicle we will put on the road here where there really is no reason for rejection in terms of either size or capability."" A TALL ORDERAs a group, FCA plans to invest 48 billion euros ($61 billion) over five years to boost sales by 60 percent to 7 million cars.Its ambitions for Fiat are more modest in comparison: sales are seen growing by nearly 30 percent to 1.9 vehicles by 2018, with the brand focusing growth on the Americas and Asia, while aiming to keep deliveries flat in a struggling European market.But some analysts think that will be a tall order, especially if Fiat has to compete with Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jeep for the heavily indebted group's stretched finances.They also say Fiat's five-year product pipeline of 27 new entries includes few surprises besides remakes of its popular 500, Panda, or Punto models. By 2017, the brand will only feature two or three models in the fast-growing compact SUV segment, they add.FCA said during its strategy announcement it recognized the need to purify the DNA of the Fiat brand, and that it would develop products that are either ""functional"" or ""aspirational"".It also said it would leverage the 500 family to expand in the upper segment of the mainstream market.""That entire brand has lots of magic sprinkled on their product,"" said Portia's Nakagawa, referring to the 500's past successes and the new Panda, which has been selling well.

1255,"Oct 02, 2014 05:00AM ET",Europe's carmakers walk tightrope between low cost and high spec,nan,"By Edward Taylor PARIS (Reuters) - Carmakers are betting on style and recycling in the battle for Europe's burgeoning small car market, adding hi-tech safety and entertainment features while often using older vehicle underpinnings as a way to keep prices down.Several new cars on display at this month's Paris auto show from Opel, Citroen, Skoda and Kia are based largely on modified components used in a previous generation vehicle, or taken from another model already on the road, as a way to save cash.Analysts say the move makes sense, as austerity-scarred Europeans are in no mood to splash out on expensive, big cars.While the region's auto sales are growing again after a six-year slump, they are still down around 20 percent from their 2007 peak and a full recovery looks years away.The market for small, fuel-efficient cars, or so-called A-segment subcompacts, has been a rare bright spot. It has grown by 32 percent in the past 10 years to reach 1.12 million vehicles in 2013, at a time when the market for slightly larger B-segment cars, such as the Ford Fiesta, has slumped 33 percent to 2.89 million, according to forecaster IHS Automotive.They predict further growth in the A-segment of 15 percent to 2020.But competition is heating up, and so the pressure on carmakers to lower manufacturing costs by sharing ever more parts among their models is intensifying.""The winners in the auto industry will be those who can attain economies of scale,"" said Wolfgang Bernhart, a partner at Roland Berger strategy consultants.Volkswagen currently leads the European car market with its namesake brand accounting for just over 12 percent of new registrations in the first seven months of 2014. It is in the midst of introducing a new production platform aimed at sharing more parts between cars.But the VW brand is closely followed by PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, with the latter growing at three times the rate of the market thanks in part to its budget brand Dacia. And others are fighting hard with their own strategies to keep manufacturing costs down.Opel's fifth generation Corsa for example, a 10,500 euros ($13,200) compact runabout, is based on a rehashed version of Opel's old Fiat-GM underpinnings, used in the current Corsa, which has been on the market since 2006.HIGH SPECMany of the savings in manufacturing are being put into new features previously only available in more expensive models as automakers strive to stand out from the crowd.Citroen's Cactus Airflow 2L concept car, for instance, is a no-frills compact family car with a hybrid drivetrain, based on underpinnings from the Peugeot 208, according to Rémi Cornubert, partner at the Automotive Practice at Oliver Wyman in Paris.""It's an example of cleverly combining elements from value brands with some upmarket features,"" he said.Though the Cactus has two digital flatscreens as the dashboard, it has manual rather than electric rear passenger windows, does with a small engine and relatively simple and inexpensive suspension.The focus on features over significant improvements in engine performance appears to chime with the priorities of European drivers. Currently 50 to 60 percent of all cars in the European Union are only equipped with the cheapest engine, according to consultants Roland Berger.Skoda, owned by Volkswagen, is due to unveil an all new version of its Fabia compact at the Paris show which borrows extensively from the group's parts bin.It offers an emergency braking function, intervening when necessary to prevent a collision. And yet, like most of the new subcompacts, it will cost almost the same as the model it replaces -- around 11,600 euros.Even value brand Hyundai, which is unveiling its new i20 in Paris, will offer a rear-view camera integrated into the seven inch ""infotainment"" screen and a smartphone docking station in addition to high-end security features such as a lane-departure warning system.(1 US dollar = 0.7934 euro)(Editing by Mark Potter)"
1256,"Oct 02, 2014 02:20AM ET",Renault aims to reclaim lost ground with minivan turned SUV,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume PARIS (Reuters) - The minivan is dead, long live the SUVan. Renault has revamped the elderly Espace people carrier as a crossover sport utility vehicle as it seeks to relive the marque's past glories.Illustrating a market shift to more rugged-looking vehicles, the fifth Espace - smaller than its predecessors but still gargantuan by European standards - made its debut at the Paris auto show on Thursday, 30 years after the first model was unleashed on European consumers who hadn't yet realized they wanted one.Like the Chrysler Voyager that narrowly preceded it - and contributed to the North American cult of the ""soccer mom"" - the Renault Espace created a whole new market for large minivans and swiftly became a hit for its maker. More than 1.2 million of the vehicles have been sold over the three decades.""It's certainly a great nameplate to revive, because it was quite something for Renault,"" UBS analyst Philippe Houchois said. ""It was about the closest Renault ever got to a premium product.""For almost a decade Renault has been all but banished from larger-car categories after a series of flops such as the 2007 Laguna sedan and Vel Satis, since discontinued. Instead, the company has been doing brisk business in low-cost cars under its budget Dacia badge.Under chief designer Laurens van den Acker, hired from Mazda in 2009, the core brand has begun pushing back with smaller models such as the fourth Renault Clio mini and Captur, Europe's best-selling subcompact SUV.But the real test comes with the Espace - the current version of which is 11 years old - and a slew of launches coming in its wake. A compact offroader, an updated Megane hatchback and a successor to the hapless Laguna will share common architecture with 43.4 percent-owned alliance partner Nissan.FROM LEADER TO LAGGARDOnce the European market leader, the Espace is now one of the laggards of its category, far behind the Ford S-Max, which struck out in a sportier direction from its 2006 introduction and is unveiling another timely update in Paris.Large SUVs overtook European minivan sales in 2008 and doubled their tally last year, claiming 17 percent of sales in the size category, data from IHS Automotive show.""It's a global shift affecting even family vehicles, and it is here to stay,"" Societe Generale analyst Philippe Barrier said. ""Designers are having to compromise as people look for something sportier.""For the new Espace, Renault boss Carlos Ghosn gave his top designer a tough brief: achieve a more rugged, muscular look and cut the vehicle's size and fuel consumption while keeping the interior roominess of its ""one-box"" predecessor.""He asked us to totally innovate with the Espace,"" van den Acker told Reuters in an earlier interview. ""We needed to give the vehicle a smaller physical footprint and much better aerodynamics.""But a lot of the things that are good for aerodynamics and CO2 emissions are also good for design.""Compared with previous generations, the new Espace has a lower-slung, elongated look. Like the Jaguar XE sedan also displayed in Paris, the Renault vehicle drew on aerodynamic and acoustic modeling from U.S. software maker Exa to reduce development costs.The production model unveiled on Thursday closely resembles the preceding concept car with its ""strong nose"", as van den Acker described it. Pricing will be announced when order books open early next year.But Ford, which achieved four times Renault's European sales of the Espace with 17,000 S-Max deliveries in the first , will not give up its edge readily.The new Ford vehicle, which also goes on sale next year, adds more efficient EcoBoost engines, upgraded folding rear passenger seats and optional all-wheel drive.""The S-Max somewhat invented the shift from pure minivans to sport utility vehicles,"" Ford product development chief Raj Nair told Reuters. ""We've upped our game to ensure that the S-Max remains leader.""(Editing by David Goodman)"
1257,"Sep 30, 2014 09:20AM ET",Auto recovery wobbles in Paris show spotlight ,nan,"By Laurence Frost PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's anemic car market rebound could be over before it has really begun. That is the fear of executives as they gather for the Paris auto show opening on Thursday, the biggest industry event in the regional calendar.While U.S. and Japanese car sales are back at pre-crisis levels, Europe is still 20 percent below its 2007 peak.Carmakers are rolling out new models in anticipation of closing the gap -- the Paris show floor will be bristling with fuel-efficient small cars and compact SUVs.But a tentative recovery following a six-year slump is looking increasingly fragile. And this time there is little relief to be had elsewhere, with Chinese demand cooling, Russian sales in freefall and other emerging markets in sharp decline.""Few plants have been closed, headcount levels remain high, and R&D budgets have largely been left intact to ensure a future product pipeline,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said. ""The industry is just sitting tight hoping for a brighter future.""It may have to wait a while.At the end of this decade, European demand will still be 1 million vehicles short of its pre-2008 average, according to forecaster IHS Automotive.""This recovery has always had shaky foundations,"" said IHS analyst Ian Fletcher, who sees European market growth slowing to 3 percent next year after a 4.6 percent spurt in 2014.""It's about whether customers on the front line feel secure in their jobs and how heavily indebted they are from previous years,"" he said.Carmakers that were too optimistic about the pace of this year's upturn have already been forced to cut back.Ford, which is showing a new S-Max minivan in Paris, will stop building its top-selling Fiesta subcompact in Germany for 11 days in October and November.Production of PSA Peugeot Citroen models has also outpaced sales, prompting a two-week halt to assembly of the 208 and C3 small cars in Slovakia as well as 300 job cuts at its main domestic plant in eastern France.Low-cost cars offer a notable bright spot but are largely imported, leaving the region's factories with excess capacity estimated at 2-3 million vehicles a year, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman.Renault's budget Dacia range, the fastest-growing brand in Europe with a 2.9 percent market share, will be unveiling crossover versions of its Moroccan-built Lodgy and Dokker vans.Besides the no-frills range, Renault has been cushioned from the crisis by its 43.4 percent stake in Japan's Nissan, and Fiat is similarly shielded by Chrysler after taking full control of the U.S. carmaker early this year.It is Peugeot, showing small concept cars using a compressed-air hybrid drivetrain developed with Bosch [ROBG.UL], that is most exposed to Europe. Some 60 percent of its sales are still generated in the region and almost a third of its global production in high-cost France.DARKENING SKIESRegional demand is ""a contributor to the recovery of Peugeot, which is heavily implanted in Europe,"" Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Tuesday.""We are placing our hopes in the continuation of this growth, although its weakness makes us rather cautious about whether it will last.""European auto stocks have tumbled 14 percent since June 6, based on the 14-member Stoxx Europe 600 Autos & Parts index, after doubling in value over the course of a two-year rally driven by recovery hopes.""The momentum has turned from positive in early summer to very negative right now,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with ISI Group.The outlook has worsened as consumer and business confidence are ""dragged down because of the whole Russian situation"", Ellinghorst added.Russian car sales were down 26 percent in August, with the rouble tumbling as the United States and Europe stepped up sanctions over Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.China's auto-market growth is also slowing to a forecast 7.9 percent next year from 11.2 percent expected in 2014, according to IHS. That threatens to curb the bumper profits that have allowed premium carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi to ride out the crisis at home.The German big three are challenged by the pricing fallout from their intense sales rivalry, as well as new competition from the likes of Tata's Jaguar Land Rover, whose Jaguar XE sedan makes its public debut in Paris.European market leader Volkswagen also looks vulnerable to demand weakness at home, as it struggles to rein in cost overruns at the heartland Wolfsburg plant.But a real rebound must happen sometime, and Bernstein's Warburton sees Europe's average vehicle age -- 9 years, compared with a pre-crisis 7.9 -- among reasons to be cheerful.""There must be some form of pent-up demand building in Europe,"" he said in a recent note. ""There is clear upside for vehicle demand, if only a proper recovery gets underway.""(Editing by Mark Potter)"
1258,"Sep 15, 2014 12:50PM ET",Exclusive: Nissan faces battery plant cuts as electric car hopes fade,nan,"By Laurence Frost PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan (T:7201) boss Carlos Ghosn is preparing to cut battery manufacturing, people familiar with the matter said, in a new reversal on electric cars that has re-opened deep divisions with alliance partner Renault (PA:RENA). The plan, which faces stiff resistance within the Japanese carmaker, would see U.S. and British production phased out and a reduced output of next-generation batteries concentrated at its domestic plant, two alliance sources told Reuters. In what may also prove a politically sensitive blow to Japan Inc., Nissan would follow Renault by taking cheaper batteries from South Korea's LG Chem (KS:051910) for some future vehicles, including models made in China. ""We set out to be a leader in battery manufacturing but it turned out to be less competitive than we'd wanted,"" said one executive on condition of anonymity. ""We're still between six months and a year behind LG in price-performance terms."" A decision is due next month on the Nissan battery plants in Sunderland, England, and Smyrna, Tennessee, the sources said, following a tense procurement review with 43.4 percent shareholder Renault, the smaller but senior partner in their 15-year-old alliance. ""Renault would clearly prefer to go further down the LG sourcing route, and the Nissan engineers would obviously prefer to stay in-house,"" another insider said. ""The write-off costs are potentially huge."" Responding to the Reuters report, Ghosn said that Nissan may open battery procurement to LG and other suppliers, adding that no decision had yet been made. Alliance spokeswoman Rachel Konrad said Renault-Nissan was ""100-percent committed to its industry-leading electric vehicle program"" and had no plans to write down battery investments. Nissan is already negotiating with manufacturing partner NEC Corp. (T:6701) on the shift to dual sourcing, with Ghosn's backing, the sources said. Nissan currently makes all its own electric car batteries. One option being explored would see LG, which supplies some Renault models, invest in its own battery production at one of the overseas Nissan plants as the carmaker halts operations at the sites. The alliance is also in talks with LG on a deal to supply batteries for future Renault and Nissan electric models in China, one of the sources added. NEC and LG declined to comment. Under Ghosn, who heads both companies, Renault-Nissan bet more on electric cars than any mainstream competitor, pledging in 2009 to invest 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) to build models including the Nissan Leaf compact and as many as 500,000 batteries per year to power them. Nissan and NEC invested 23 billion yen ($215 million) in their Zama, Japan battery plant and electrode manufacturing, backed by government aid. U.S. and British taxpayers also helped with the $1 billion invested in Tennessee and 210 million pounds ($341 million) in Sunderland. But the mass consumer was largely unmoved - or deterred by the sluggish rollout of recharging networks - despite generous sales incentives in key markets. Global electric car sales will remain shy of 1 million in 2020, according to forecaster IHS Automotive, less than one percent of the total vehicle market, and one-tenth of the demand Ghosn had predicted. ""Renault-Nissan were definitely ahead of their time - in a bad way,"" said Stuart Pearson, an Exane BNP analyst. ""There's nothing wrong with ambition, but when that involves excess investment then it's also a risk,"" he said. ""Their targets were really excessive on volume and battery capacity."" The alliance has begun a belated push into faster-selling hybrids, combining electric and combustion-engine propulsion. Upscale electric rivals such as Tesla's (O:TSLA) Model S meanwhile hog the limelight, backed by big investments in newer, cheaper battery technologies. INTERNAL RIVALRIES Ghosn dropped extra battery sites planned for both alliance carmakers, leaving Nissan with the entire production capacity of 220,000 power packs through the NEC joint venture, AESC. But that still far exceeds the 67,000 electric cars Renault-Nissan sold last year, and even the 176,000 registered to date. A pledge to reach 1.5 million by 2016 has been scrapped. The coming hybrids will fill some of the excess plant capacity, although they use fewer power cells per vehicle. An all-electric Tesla rival is still planned for Nissan's premium Infiniti brand in 2018 with batteries as big as 60 kilowatt-hours (kWh), more than twice the energy capacity of the Leaf, which is due for replacement the previous year. Nissan is seeking to unwind a ruinous NEC contract that requires it to purchase electrodes for the full capacity of 220,000 Leaf-sized 24 kWh batteries regardless of actual sales, sources said. The joint venture partner's consent is also needed to bring LG production or other activities onto the Tennessee or Sunderland sites, which together employ 500 workers. The financial hit for Nissan ""will depend on what else we can do with the plants"", with heavy charges likely if both are closed, one manager added. Renault has already taken at least one writedown of 85 million euros on its over-investment in electric cars following the collapse of Better Place - a charging startup that had ordered 100,000 of its battery-powered Fluence sedans. The Nissan procurement shift could still be thwarted by capacity-cutting costs including repayment of U.S. and British government support. Next-generation battery manufacturing at Zama would also likely need fresh Japanese aid to compete with LG and its subsidies from Seoul, sources said. Navigating the battery backtrack is a key test for CEO Ghosn as he demands closer Renault-Nissan integration from executives mandated to pursue savings across the alliance. For Nissan, the plant cuts would be a partial retreat from the automotive battery market - expected to top $20 billion by 2020 - just as California-based Tesla builds its $5 billion ""Gigafactory"" with Panasonic (T:6752) in Nevada. Japanese engineers are still smarting from Renault's 2010 move to drop Nissan batteries and purchase LG for its flagship Zoe model, worsening the overcapacity problem. ""It was a 15-20 percent cost gap,"" said one of the people involved in the Renault decision. ""In purchasing, 3-4 percent is usually enough to choose a partner for."" Today's Nissan batteries come in at $270 per kWh, based on replacement prices thought to be below cost, according to consulting firm AlixPartners. The true manufacturing cost is believed to be over $300, inflated by the amortization of unused plant capacity and the burdensome electrodes deal. The next generation will have lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathodes, as used by LG, rather than the current lithium manganese oxide (LMO) chemistry. The alliance cost target is $200/kWh, whether made or bought, sources said. With a clean slate and sufficient volume, Nissan engineers insist, their next generation of batteries could be competitive on price as well as keeping crucial know-how at the company. ""When you're developing cutting-edge technology, the best way to know about that technology is to build it in-house,"" said one. ""That's what Tesla is doing."" Many of the past missteps can be traced to internal rivalries of the kind Ghosn is only now moving to stamp out. Former Nissan second-in-command Carlos Tavares, racing to beat the Renault Zoe to market, cut Leaf development by a year and skipped a critical battery redesign, according to alliance veterans. Nissan later cut prices, settled a class action and offered retroactive warranties to answer customer concerns about battery deterioration. Tavares now heads PSA Peugeot Citroen. His Renault archrival at the time, Patrick Pelata, signed a confidentiality deal with LG that meant Nissan battery engineers never even knew what they were up against. Against that backdrop, the atmosphere may be charged when Nissan engineering boss Hideyuki Sakamoto puts final arguments against the outsourcing plan in a presentation to Ghosn as soon as this week. But the CEO's mind may be all but made up. ""We have to open up,"" Ghosn told reporters in Nantes, western France, where he was attending a test-drive event on Monday. ""We will continue making batteries but we can't get stuck with supply monopolies - even internal ones.""

1259,"Jul 30, 2014 12:00PM ET",EU Electric Car Sales Doubled In 2013,nan,"By Maria Gallucci - New battery-powered cars from Renault (PARIS:RENA), Volvo (ST:VOLVAs) and Mitsubishi Motors (TOKYO:7211) helped to double sales of electric vehicles in Europe last year, a new analysis found. But automakers still face major hurdles in moving these alternative models, including high costs and consumer anxiety.Nearly 50,000 plug-in vehicles were sold in the European Union in 2013, up from 22,000 in 2012, according to an analysis of official data by the Transport & Environment (T&E) advocacy group, the Guardian reported. Renault’s Zoe, Volvo’s V60 plug-in and Mitsubishi’s Outlander together comprised nearly half of last year’s sales, or about 8,000 models each.The leading models in 2012 – Opel’s Ampera and Puegeot’s Citroen iOn/C-zero – meanwhile saw their sales drop sharply. “What you are seeing is better cars and better services being offered to the market,” Greg Archer, the clean vehicles program manager at (T&E), told the Guardian.Overall, electric vehicles accounted for about 0.4 percent of new car sales in Europe last year. In the United States, by comparison, 0.6 percent of total passenger car and light truck sales in 2013 were plug-in models – about 96,000 vehicles.“Electric cars are growing strongly, but at the same time the simple truth is that they are too expensive for most people to consider,” Archer told the Guardian. Volvo’s V60 plug-in, for instance, cost from £44,275 ($75,000) after a £5,000 ($8,500) UK government subsidy, while Mitsubishi’s Outlander priced at about $47,800 after subsidy and Renault’s Zoe cost around $24,000 after subsidy.U.S. car buyers can obtain federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 when they buy a plug-in model, and some state governments offer additional incentives. Tesla Motors NASDAQ:TSLA's Model S luxury sedan is priced from $71,000 domestically, while the all-electric Nissan Leaf and plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt each cost around $30,000.Still, Archer said such government subsidies aren't sustainable in the long-run, and that a more effective way to get automakers to produce electric cars would be to force them to slash greenhouse gas emissions across their entire fleet. In the United States, car manufacturers are now required to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54.5 miles per gallon, but automakers in Europe are resisting attempts to adopt emissions standards on the continent, the Guardian noted.Transportation accounts for about one-fourth of total emissions in Europe and one-third of emissions in the United States.Archer said that while electric vehicles are important for reducing transportation pollution, improvements in diesel and gas-powered cars are even more critical in the near-term. ""We will not see large numbers of electric cars on the roads for a decade, so we need to see other steps as well,"" he said."

1261,"Jul 21, 2014 11:30AM ET","Tesla Believes UK Govt Could Buy Its $80,000 Cars",nan,"By Angelo Young - Tesla recently unveiled the right-hand-drive Model S and began selling the car in the U.K. for a starting price of nearly $89,000 including a hefty $16,000 consumption tax. Now, the California-made all-electric luxury sedan is reportedly being considered for the U.K. government’s $8.5 million program to introduce electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles into its agencies.By the fall, Whitehall says the government will begin purchasing its first wave of 150 plug-in vehicles for U.K. ministers.“The Model S we understand will be under evaluation for inclusion,” Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) told Bloomberg. If the U.K. were to purchase Model S sedans it would be the first government to buy the high-end luxury electric car instead of more economical all-electric or hybrid plug-in vehicles.The Model S offers the longest range of any battery electric vehicle (BEV) in the market right now, but the car also cost significantly more than other BEVs or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). And if U.K. ministers begin shuttling around in Model S sedans, they could be criticized for riding in imported foreign-made cars.The 2014 Nissan Leaf costs around $30,000 with a range of about 84 miles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy; that’s about half the price of a 60 kWh Model S with 208 miles of range. In January, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was touting the government’s efforts to promote the use of electric cars through government incentives under the Go Ultra Low campaign. That $4.3 million program brings together the five biggest BEV and PHEV makers in the U.K.: Nissan Motor Co (TOKYO:7201), Renault (PARIS:RENA), Toyota Motor Corp (TOKYO:7203), Vauxhall Motors Ltd. and Bay.Motoren Werke (XETRA:BMWG).Those automakers are likely to be strong contenders for the public procurement program, especially the Nissan Leaf, which is manufactured for the European market in Sunderland, U.K. Toyota also has manufacturing operations in the U.K.International Business Times reached out to the U.K. Department for Transport to see if there was any confirmation that Tesla was in the running for government procurement.“This announcement on Thursday did not set which models would be chosen for government fleets. It allows every agency to looks at which car suits their specific needs,” a press office spokesperson told International Business Times by phone on Monday. “The review considers the whole life-cost of each vehicle to determine the most cost-effective choice.”Telsa’s belief that it’s being evaluated by the U.K. government is likely a result to the image posted on the U.K. government’s website announcing the plan, which shows Minister of Transport Susan Kramer, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander and Cabinet Office Minister of State Oliver Letwin standing in front of five plug-in cars, including a Model S.In 2011, New York City began buying all-electric Nissan Leafs, Chevrolet Volts, Ford Transit Connects and Navi-star e-Star utility vans. Other U.S. state and local government have begun rolling out official plug-in vehicles. Range is less of an issue for many government fleet vehicles because they are more likely to have predictable routes where government charging stations can be installed and maintained. They are less likely to be used for long-distance driving, too, eliminating concerns over running out of power between charging stations.Tesla will announce its second-quarter financial statement on July 31."
1262,"Jul 09, 2014 04:05AM ET",GM Korea workers approve strike as wage talks stall,nan,"SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean workers on Wednesday voted to go on strike over salaries and production volume, signalling tough annual wage talks for automakers already grappling with falling earnings due to the stronger won. Strikes are an almost annual event in South Korea's $173 billion auto industry, but this year's unrest could be more prolonged than usual as workers are calling for the revamping of a 60-year-old wage scheme among other demands. A union spokesman said 69 percent of GM Korea's 14,016 workers voted to down tools and walk out for a fourth consecutive year unless they reach a deal. A union spokesman was not immediately available for comment as representatives were engaged in another round of negotiations with GM Korea management. A spokesman for GM Korea said the vote did not mean that there will be an actual strike and said it was one of the union's ""ordinary actions"" during annual negotiations. ""Both sides remain committed to reaching a fair and reasonable labour agreement based on mutual trust and understanding,"" the spokesman said. Unions are demanding changes to the wage scheme, which has been in place since 1953, because the country's supreme court ruled late last year that fixed bonuses should be counted as base wages. Workers want their new contract to comply with the ruling because it would increase various statutory benefits, such as overtime allowances and severance pay, which are adjusted in proportion to base wages. GM Korea workers are also calling for management to boost production after the U.S. automaker announced plans to stop selling Chevrolet-branded cars in Europe by the end of 2015. South Korea is one of GM's biggest Asian manufacturing bases, producing nearly all Chevy cars sold in Europe and more than four out of 10 Chevrolet vehicles marketed globally. GM Korea CEO Sergio Rocha on Monday warned employees that a strike could jeopardise production and job security, and urged them to ""stop this vicious cycle before it is too late"". GM Korea and other rivals like Hyundai Motor Co (KS:005380) are wrangling with their individual unions over whether to overhaul the current wage system, which management says could lead to higher labour costs. Workers at Renault SA's (PA:RENA) South Korean unit last week voted in favour of a strike, although talks continue, while ongoing wage negotiations at Hyundai are expected to drag into next month. Hyundai is expected to report lackluster second-quarter earnings later this month as the South Korean won posted its biggest annual percentage gain in nearly three years versus the dollar, eroding its overseas earnings converted into the South Korean currency.

1263,"Jul 08, 2014 03:09AM ET",GM Korea CEO warns of output cut as strike vote looms,nan,"SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korea chief warned employees that a potential strike could lead to further production cuts in one of its major Asian manufacturing bases, according to an email sent to staff and obtained by Reuters. GM's 15,000 unionised workers in South Korea plan to cast ballots on Tuesday and Wednesday on whether to stage a strike for a fourth consecutive year, signaling a resurgence of summer labour unrest in the country's auto industry. ""We have seen such (strike) decisions boomerang on us. If a loss in production is incurred again this year due to strikes, the result could be much worse than we can imagine,"" GM Korea CEO Sergio Rocha said in the email, which was dated Monday. The U.S. automaker said in December that it would stop selling its Chevrolet-branded cars in Europe by the end of 2015, a move that hit output at its South Korean unit, which produces most of the Chevy cars sold in Europe. That decision helped send GM Korea's exports slumping by a quarter in the first half of this year from a year earlier. ""It may lead to an additional reduction in production volume, which is closely related to our job security. We need to stop this vicious cycle before it is too late,"" Rocha said. GM Korea and its labour union started annul wage talks in April, but they have been locking horns over wage increases and future production plans. ""GM Korea is at a critical juncture...While there are a number of issues that have weakened our competitiveness such as soaring costs, and labor conflicts, losses as the result of strike actions during previous negotiations represent one of the biggest,"" Rocha said. A GM Korea spokesman declined to comment on the email, while a union spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Automakers in South Korea are often subject to labour strikes during annual wage talks, although they usually recoup most lost production by working longer hours once talks are settled. Workers at Renault SA's (PA:RENA) South Korean unit last week voted in favour of a strike, although talks continue, while ongoing wage talks at Hyundai Motors (KS:005380) are expected to drag on into next month.

The battery giant said it plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the plant, which when completed will have the capacity to produce batteries for more than 100,000 electric cars per year, LG Chem said in a statement.The Korean company will operate the plant in partnership with two Chinese-controlled companies. LG Chem will own half of the joint venture, while the other half will be unevenly divided between the two Nanjing-based firms. LG Chem declined to disclose the total amount of investment by all three parties, Wall Street Journal reported.The Nanjing plant is expected to generate nearly $1 billion in total sales between 2015 and 2020, LG Chem said.The battery factory could give LG Chem an early edge in the burgeoning market for emission-free vehicles in China, according to analysts. While demand for electric cars has so far been sluggish in the world’s largest car market, Chinese sales are expected to pick up in the coming years thanks to government targets to put 500,000 plug-in cars on the road by 2015 and 5 million vehicles by 2020.“[LG Chem’s] expansion into China is positive in that it can gain early access to a potentially huge market, as demand for electric vehicles is expected to take off after 2015,” Lee Ji-Yeon, an analyst at Taurus Securities, told Financial Times.LG Chem’s plant will supply Chinese carmakers such as Saic Motor (SS:600104) and Qoros Auto Co. Ltd. and global auto companies such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Renault (PARIS:RENA). The company also makes batteries for electric vehicle models made by Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Hyundai Motors (KS:005380)., KIA Motors (KS:000270), and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co’s Volvo (ST:VOLVAs), WSJ noted.The announcement comes just months after Samsung SDI (KS:006400) unveiled a similar battery expansion plan in China. The South Korean manufacturer said in January that it would build a car battery plant in Xi’an by 2015, as well as invest $600 million in the joint project with a local partner over the next five years, Financial Times said. Samsung SDI provides batteries for Chrysler and BMW’s electric car models, and has partnered with Ford to develop new plug-in battery technologies.Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), the darling of electric car fans and founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk, also has plans for a proposed battery “gigafactory,” though it hasn’t decided yet where to build it. Japanese firm Panasonic Corp. (TOKYO:6752) in May signed a letter of intent to participate in building the factory, which could cost as much as $5 billion and allow Tesla to sell as many as 500,000 cars a year."
1265,"Jun 30, 2014 04:20PM ET",BMW to reveal Mexico factory plans this week: official,nan,"MEXICO CITY/MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany's BMW AG (DE:BMWG) will unveil this week plans to build a new factory in Mexico, a government official said, as the company seeks to meet growing demand for premium cars.News of the factory comes just days after BMW's German rival, Daimler, announced similar plans, and adds to a growing list of companies plowing money into car making in Mexico.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the Mexican official said the plant would likely amount to an investment of at least 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) and would be located either in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City or San Luis Potosi in central Mexico.A spokesman for Munich-based BMW said earlier on Monday that ""a decision will be made public"" on July 3.BMW declined to comment further.A new factory in Mexico would come on top of BMW's plans to invest $1 billion to expand capacity by 50 percent at its plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina.BMW Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer said last week that the Bavarian carmaker was still deliberating about where to locate a new factory and would reach a decision before the summer break.Premium auto makers BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz are expanding global production as their factories in Germany struggle to meet strong demand for off-road vehicles and limousines in the United States and Asia.Supplier sources said BMW had already mapped out a production timetable for Mexico, with a tentative plan to begin assembly in late 2017, ramping up annual capacity to 200,000 by 2020.On Friday, Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) and Renault Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7201) said they would invest 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) to develop small cars and build a factory in Aguascalientes, Mexico.Manufacturing in Mexico allows European car makers to sell vehicles in the United States while avoiding some of the currency and tariff costs that crimp profits on imports. Mexico also offers lower labor costs than Germany and the United States.Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co (T:7267), Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) already have large auto plants in Mexico.At around $2.50 an hour, manufacturing wages in the country are nearly 20 percent cheaper than in China, according to a Bank of America study. That study put U.S. manufacturing wages at just under $20 an hour, on average.German car makers' overall output is set to rise for the fifth year in 2014, driven by overseas production, German auto industry association VDA has said.(Reporting by Luis Rojas in Mexico City and Irene Preisinger in Munich; additional reporting by Edward Taylor; and Dave Graham.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.74% drop, S&P 500 futures signaled a declined 0.75% , while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.65% slump. Gloomy earnings and outlook statements from global giants such as Apple and Amazon, and European firms Renault and Gucci have steadily corroded the hopes of a recovery in the global economy. Investors wanted to see that recovery confirmed by the U.S. gross domestic product data, especially with uncertainty growing over the budget problems in Washington, known as the fiscal cliff, which could depress business activity early next year. Markets were also jittery amid ongoing uncertainty over when Spain will request a bailout and trigger the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Apple delivered a second straight quarter of disappointing results and iPad sales fell well short of Wall Street's targets, sending shares down only 0.09% in pre-market trade.  The consumer goods sector was also likely to be in focus, amid reports Dean Foods Co's Morningstar business has attracted takeover interest from Michael Foods and Mexican dairy company Grupo Lala. According to Reuters, the deal could be valued in the USD1 billion to USD1.5 billion range.  Separately, Wal-Mart Stores said it plans to open 100 more stores in China and create 18,000 jobs there over the next three years, in a bid to boost its presence in China's booming but highly competitive hypermarket sector.  Elsewhere, Amazon.com Inc saw shares tumbled 1.30% pre-market, after the company reported its first quarterly net loss in more than five years on Thursday, as the world's largest Internet retailer spent heavily and suffered from an economic slowdown in Europe. Other stocks in focus included Comcast and Merck, due to report earnings before the bell on Friday. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.46%, France’s CAC 40 declined 0.40%, Germany's DAX retreated 0.48%, while Britain's FTSE 100 slumped 0.68%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.21%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index plunged 1.35%.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release preliminary data on third quarter gross domestice product. In addition, the University of Michigan was to release revised data on consumer sentiment."

 (Releads, adds details on Japan, Pelata succession)  By Helen Massy-Beresford and Gilles Guillaume  PARIS, April 29 (Reuters) - Renault sought to move on from
an embarrassing botched spy probe, pledging on Friday to quickly
find a new chief operating officer as it took a step towards
firing a security executive at the heart of the investigation. The group held a pre-dismissal hearing with a representative
of the security executive accused of fraud in a case that
sparked an industrial espionage probe, a spokesman said. He was speaking on the sidelines of Renault's annual
shareholders' meeting, at which it faced shareholders for the
first time since the industrial spying-turned fraud fiasco that
forced its chief operating officer Patrick Pelata to quit. Renault fired three executives in January, saying its
high-profile electric vehicle project had been targeted by an
international spy network, but later had to admit it was
tricked, the men did nothing wrong and there was no spying. The former security manager, Dominique Gevrey, is in custody
and is under investigation for fraud. Under French law, Renault
has to wait 48 hours after the pre-dismissal hearing before it
can fire him.  EXECUTIVE SELECTION  Renault has begun selecting a replacement for Pelata, who
will remain with the Renault-Nissan alliance, the head of its
nominations committee told shareholders. ""The nominations and governance committee has begun the
process of selecting and interviewing the people likely to take
over the functions of chief operating officer of Renault,"" Marc
Ladreit de Lacharriere told the meeting. He gave no indication
of how long the process would take or who was in the running. Media reports have named Philippe Klein, executive vice
president of product planning and programmes, CFO Dominique
Thormann and partner Nissan Motor's Americas head Carlos Tavares
as possible successors to Pelata. Renault said on Thursday it had finalised an agreement to
compensate the three executives it wrongly fired. One of the
three, Matthieu Tenenbaum, will rejoin the company on May 2,
Renault said, while the other two have declined offers of
reinstatement. Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, who is also CEO of
Renault's Japanese alliance partner Nissan Motor, told
shareholders he was delighted an agreement had been reached. Ghosn said disruption to Japan's auto supply chain from the
earthquake and tsunami would not have a long-term impact. ""This crisis does not call into question our 2013 targets or
our 2016 vision,"" he said. ""This shortage (of some electronic
components) will have a limited timespan until component
factories get up and running again and other suppliers can take
over."" The group set out a strategic plan in February that aimed to
nearly double its operating margin to more than 5 percent of
sales in 2013, as part of a growth plan that targets Brazil and
Russia as key markets. Renault on Tuesday said it would stick to its full-year
goals as it posted a forecast-beating 15 percent rise in
first-quarter sales.

 (Adds fresh prices after Fed statement) By Al Yoon and Herbert Lash NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was at a
three-year low against major currencies and world equity
markets edged slightly higher on Wednesday after the Federal
Reserve signaled it would maintain its extensive support for
the U.S. economy. Wall Street rebounded slightly and oil prices nudged up
after the Fed indicated in a statement that it believed the
economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace, with
little risk an inflationary psychology would take hold. For
details see: [ID:nN26291565] The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said as
expected after a two-day meeting that it intends to complete
its $600 billion bond-buying program in June as scheduled. ""We did not expect any material surprises in the FOMC
statement and there was none. It remains quite dovish,"" said  
Bret Barker, a portfolio manager at TCW in Los Angeles. ""It could be argued they slightly downgraded growth and
maintained the view that inflation is 'transitory.' It was very
boilerplate,"" Barker said. Following the FOMC statement investors now await remarks by
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke who speak starting at 2:15 p.m. (1815
GMT) at his first-ever news conference on monetary policy. Bernanke will likely hammer home the case for a patient
approach to withdrawing the Fed's extensive support for the
U.S. economy The dollar fell against the euro after bouncing around a
bit before the single European currency ultimately extended
gains to trade at 1.4700, up about 0.4 percent on the day. The dollar slipped to 82.36 yen from 82.60 yen 
before the announcement, but remained up 1.1 percent on the
day. [ID:nW1E7FI013] and [ID:nN26291565]. After the Fed
statement the dollar index  remained near the three year
low seen earlier on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 32.54
points, or 0.26 percent, at 12,627.91. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index  was up 0.63 points, or 0.05 percent, at
1,347.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 2.91
points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,850.45. Crude oil prices rose, lifted by a sharp drawdown in U.S.
fuel inventories, after U.S. Energy Information Administration
data showed domestic gasoline stockpiles fell 2.51 million
barrels last week to the lowest level since August 2009.
[ID:nL3E7FR0CO] It was the 10th drawdown in a row, much deeper than the 1.1
million barrel draw forecast in a Reuters poll. [EIA/S] ""Crude futures headed back higher, after the initial
knee-jerk selling on the EIA stock build, as traders reacted to
the drawdowns in product stocks, chiefly gasoline,"" said Gene
McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford
Connecticut. ""Higher gasoline prices dragged crude up and now people are
waiting for Fed Chief Ben Bernanke's word on monetary policy."" U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 17 cents to $112.38
a barrel. U.S. Treasury prices briefly extended their decline after
the FOMC statement. Benchmark 10-year notes  last
traded down 11/32 in price to yield 3.35 percent after falling
as much as 15/32 earlier in the session. The difference between interest rates set by the Fed and
other major central banks, which have been raising rates, is
underpinning the dollar's weakness. While the Fed continues to print money, the European
Central Bank raised rates for the first time in two years this
month and is poised for a repeat dose before too long. The U.S. government reported orders for durable goods
increased 2.5 percent in March, greater than the 2.0 percent
rise expected in a Reuters poll of economists.

euro zone's blue chip index, held significantly above its 50-day
moving average of 2,931.62, and analysts said the bullish trend
remained intact for now.  ""The short-term upward bias for equities remains up,
confirming the current risk-on situation on the financial
markets,"" said Roelof-Jan Van den Akker, senior technical
analyst at ING.  ""A close above the previous highs around 2,992 opens the way
for a test of the longer-term crucial resistance in the line
chart around the 3,100 level,"" he said, adding that a close
above 3,100 would prompt a longer-term ""buy"" signal. The index closed 0.8 percent higher at 1,977.59 points.  Upbeat earnings helped individual shares push higher, in a
confirmation of brightening prospects for companies as the
economy recovers. Telecoms gear maker Ericsson rose 10.8 percent to the top of
the FTSEurofirst 300 leaderboard after it beat first-quarter
core profit expectations.  Carmakers were also on the rise, with Germany's Volkswagen
 and Porsche both up around 6 percent on robust first-quarter
results, while France's Renault added 3.8 percent after posting
better-than-expected sales. Barclays, however, was pressured by disappointing earnings,
dropping 4.8 percent after the British lender's first-quarter
profit fell on the back of lower income at its key investment
banking unit.  DATA SUPPORTS The FTSEurofirst 300 index earlier extended gains after data
showed new orders for durable goods in the United States rose
solidly in March, and bookings for the prior month were much
stronger than initially thought, pointing to strength in the
manufacturing sector. The data comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen keeping
to its $600 billion bond buying programme, taking the view that
the economy still needs monetary policy support, even as hawkish
Fed officials have recently voiced the need for tightening to
avoid stoking rising inflation. ""Investors want to know exactly how the monetary authority
will develop its current economic policy, with inflation likely
to be the hot topic on the agenda,"" said Ben Critchley, sales
trader at IG Index.

their highest close in eight weeks on Wednesday, after earnings
from the likes of bellwether Ericsson beat forecasts. At 1204 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.5 percent at 1,152.06 points, to be ahead for
the fifth day. ""We have had a strong results season in the U.S. so far, and
there have been no big problems in Europe, though it is early
days,"" said Graham Secker, European equity strategist at Morgan
Stanley.  Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson's shares surged 9.6
percent after it blasted past first-quarter core profit
expectations. Elsewhere in the sector, Nokia rose 2.7 percent after the
world's largest phone maker by volume said it would  lay off
4,000 people and outsource another 3,000 to Accenture as part of
a plan to slash annual spending by 1 billion euros ($1.46
billion). Renault rose 4.7 percent after the French carmaker posted
better-than-expected sales. Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline was up 1.7 percent after its
results. Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the
direction of equities, until volumes picked up.  ""Some of the liquidity has been due to pent-up demand for
equities from big institutions, which have spent the last decade
selling their equities, and buying bonds, and now realise bonds
are not such a good investment,"" said Secker. ""We think equities
will move sideways for the next few months within a range."" Investors were awaiting clues from the U.S. Federal Reserve
on an exit strategy from its support for the economy, with
investors trimming their exposure to risky assets such as mining
stocks. Heavyweights BNP Billiton and Anglo American fell 1.4
and 1.0 percent respectively. The Fed was expected to stick to its plan to complete its
$600 billion bond-buying program in June, but questions about
the exit strategy will likely arise when chairman Ben Bernanke
holds a news conference during which he may give hints on the
central bank's thinking on the matter. ""If he was to open the door to QE3, equities would take that
positively, but I do not think that will happen,"" said Secker.
""If he was to talk about monetary tightening post the end of
QE2, that would be taken negatively. I suspect he is going to
fudge the issue and be as bland as possible."" European blue chips outperformed, rising 0.7 percent.  ""We are seeing a flight to quality this week, with falling
bond yields in the United States, Germany and France. Investors
clearly want better returns and a protection against inflation,
but they still do not really trust equities in general,"" said
Marc Gilson, head of Paris-based fund management firm Fival.  OILS RISE  Energy companies gained as crude prices edged above $124 per
barrel, supported by a weaker dollar. Sterling neared a 17-month
high against the dollar, after data showed the British economy
grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter. BP rose 1.5 percent, buoyed by a more reassuring outlook,
trader said, though first-quarter profit fell. Total, ENI and Royal Dutch Shell rose 1.2-1.6 percent. Not all earnings  news was positive. Barclays dropped 5 percent after the British lender's
first-quarter profit fell on the back of lower income at its key
investment banking unit. Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 0.8 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 0.6

 is talking to partners and Nissan Motor
 about working together on fuel cell technology, its

lot of sense to join forces also in this field,"" Thomas Weber,
board member for research and development at the maker of
Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars, said at the Shanghai auto show.	 ""We are really concretely discussing this topic,"" he said. Renault, Nissan and Daimler signed a deal a year ago to swap
small stakes in each other and jointly develop cars in a tie-up
they said at the time could lead to combined savings of 4
billion euros  ($5.8 billion) over five years. [ID:nLDE6361D5]	 Partnerships are essential in the car industry, as players
struggle to stay ahead of new technology developments and
emissions-cutting legislation, and teaming up allows them to
share costs and risk.	 ""We are in a concrete product development phase, so
therefore we are discussing concrete projects on the fuel cell
side, bundling resources so that we could come faster to the

energy is produced inside the fuel cell, Weber added.	 ""The idea could be based on a lot of knowledge on all sides
of the alliance to find these components where we can join
forces, harmonise technologies,"" he said, adding the move would
help to cut down initial costs when the technology was launched.	 Weber said fuel-cell cars could become a reality for the
mass market by 2015. ""The technology is there -- in 2015 latest
we will start volume production.""	 Weber said pure electric vehicle technology would definitely
be needed too to meet tightening emissions legislation, but that
the advantages of fuel-cell technology were its shorter charging
time, longer range and need for fewer charging stations in each
market.	 Renault and Nissan are betting heavily on electric vehicle
technology, jointly investing 4 billion euros in EVs as part of
their long-standing alliance. Nissan's electric Leaf is already
on sale while Renault is due to launch its first electric models
later this year.	 Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche had earlier told journalists the
three car makers were looking at ways to cooperate beyond the
projects they set out when they signed their deal, and could use

Renault's internal probe into its industrial espionage fiasco
said on Monday he views CEO Carlos Ghosn as an innocent victim
of the affair. The comments by Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology and
one of two men in charge of the internal probe, are the latest
sign that Ghosn is likely to survive after his trusted deputy
Patrick Pelata was forced to resign over the scandal. After it became clear that the three executives fired and
accused of leaking information on electric vehicles had done
nothing wrong, there had been speculation that Ghosn and his
position atop the Renault-Nissan alliance could be vulnerable. But officials of the French government, which owns 15
percent of the automaker, have indicated they have no desire for
Ghosn to follow his deputy Patrick Pelata out the door, an
impression reinforced by Bauer's comments. ""He subcontracted and delegated ... in fact Carlos Ghosn was
a victim of an abuse of confidence in this affair, one more
victim,"" Bauer told RTL radio. Asked if it was understandable that Ghosn had not resigned,
Bauer said: ""I understand the saying according to which the

I understand very well.""  Ghosn had used this phrase to defend himself in a newspaper
interview last week, saying that a captain should not jump ship

controlled by Morocco's royal family has announced a sharp surge
in net profit and assets in 2010 amid street demands for King
Mohammed to reduce his business and political clout. National Investment Co., or SNI, made a consolidated net
profit of 8.28 billion dirhams ($1.06 billion) in 2010, up from
2.38 billion in 2009, according to financial statements
published over the weekend in Le Matin, one of Morocco's most
pro-establishment newspapers. Siger, the firm that groups the main business interests of
the Moroccan royal family, holds a stake of around 60 percent in
SNI, market sources said. Officials at SNI could not immediately
be reached to confirm the figure. SNI's assets and turnover rose more than fourfold to 102.6
billion dirhams and 14.08 billion respectively in 2010 compared
with 22.53 billion dirhams and 3.43 billion in 2009. Based on the latest growth forecasts, Morocco's 2010 Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) should stand at 761.6 billion dirhams. SNI gave no explanation for its performance in 2010.  However, in August SNI and ONA Group, in which SNI already
held a majority stake, both delisted from the Casablanca bourse
to pave the way for a merger that would see ONA transfer all its
assets to SNI. ""The rise in net profit appears to have been fuelled by
capital gains on the transfer to SNI of assets ONA owned in
listed firms,"" a market source said. Explaining what prompted SNI to publish its financial
statements after being delisted, another source said: ""It had to
publish its financial statements because it has bonds traded in
the stock market"". Both sources did not want to be named citing
a ""sensitive political context"". Debt, which SNI itemised as non-recurring financial debt,
stood at 30.91 billion dirhams by the end of 2010 against 7.57
billion at the end of 2009. Of those, bonds totalled 13.7
billion dirhams against 3.9 billion a year earlier. A youth protest movement is spearheading calls for the king
to transfer his executive powers to elected politicians and
reduce his business clout. They, and many business leaders, say firms controlled by the
king and his close inner circle dominate key economic sectors.
At times, demonstrators have carried placards reading 'SNI
degage' -- or 'SNI clear off'. SNI has stakes in mines, steel, cement, supermarkets, sugar
refining, banking, telecommunications, insurance and renewable
energy. It is involved in partnerships with French firms
including Lafarge, Danone and Renault.  SNI also holds a 48.3 percent stake in AttijariWafa, North
Africa's biggest bank by assets. SNI is putting some of those stakes up for sale, including
AttijariWafa, Cosumar and Lesieur, the latter two being the
country's sole sugar refiner and its biggest cooking oil
producer.

 (Adds fund manager comment, detail) By Helen Massy-Beresford and Gilles Guillaume PARIS, April 12 (Reuters) - The departure of Renault's
 number two executive over a spying-turned-fraud debacle heaps
pressure on Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn when the carmaker is
trying to win investor support for its growth plans. Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata resigned on Monday,
taking the flak for an embarrassing fiasco in which Renault
fired three executives on suspicion of leaking information on
electric vehicles who turned out to have done nothing wrong. Pelata's departure safeguards Ghosn's high profile role as
head of both Renault and Nissan. But the clumsy handling of the
affair and its fallout also raise questions about Renault's
management. ""Renault's image has taken a serious hit and the whole
scandal won't go away with Pelata's departure,"" said Christian
Jimenez, a fund manager and president of Diamant Bleu Gestion in
Paris. ""Unfortunately, it was inevitable to see heads rolling, but
it doesn't change the fact that investors' confidence in
Renault's management has been shaken,"" he said, though he added
that Ghosn should still ""bounce back from this crisis"". Pelata had offered his resignation in March, when Renault
admitted it had been tricked, but Ghosn refused to accept it,
saying he did not want to ""add one crisis to another"". The management about-turn highlights the scale of government
involvement in decision-making at Renault, which is 15-percent
state-owned. Ghosn will now face the challenges of Renault's new
strategic plan without his key ally. And while Pelata will not
leave immediately and will stay with the Renault-Nissan
alliance, it is not immediately obvious who will replace him. The French carmaker's six-year strategic plan, revealed in
February, disappointed investors who were hoping for concrete
steps to revamp the financial structure of the 12-year alliance
and squeeze more value from it.  FILLING THE VOID The implementation of the plan, which prioritises
international growth in a bid to boost profitability, will be
key if Ghosn wants to win kudos from shareholders. Renault is also taking a big gamble as it readies the launch
of the first of the electric cars it hopes will make it a
mass-market leader in the burgeoning technology later this year. ""The Ghosn-Pelata double-act has worked well until now ...
so it could be difficult to quickly find a replacement, which is
a real problem,"" CM-CIC analysts wrote. ""Without Pelata at the
helm, this plan could be disrupted, even delayed by six months
to a year."" Ghosn and Pelata met at university and had perfected their
complementary roles over many years of cooperation, with Ghosn
handling strategy and Pelata implementation. ""This decision (Pelata's exit) seems symptomatic of the
group's management methods and of the involvement of the state
in the group's internal affairs,"" the CM-CIC analysts wrote. Government spokesman Francois Baroin said on Tuesday the
state had never called for Carlos Ghosn's head though it did
want sanctions. ""There were investigations, the chain of responsibility was
determined, measures have been taken and we take note of them,""
he told RTL radio. By 1415 GMT, Renault shares were down 3.7 percent to 37.55
euros, one of the top fallers on the CAC-40 index.

on Monday, with Hochtief leading the construction sector lower
after a profit warning, though strategists were
confident the market's recent rally would resume. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.2 percent to
close at 1,146.35 points, still above its 50-day moving average
after hitting a five-week closing high on Friday. Volume was
81.7 percent of the 90-day average. The index is still up more
than 7 percent from its 2011 low, hit in mid-March. ""Investors want to look through some of the issues we've
had, like Libya, and take more risk,"" said David Rickards,
global co-head of equity research at Macquarie in London.
""European valuations still look good."" The VDAX-NEW volatility index, Europe's main barometer of
investor anxiety, fell 1.3 percent to near a seven-week low. The
lower the index, the higher the market's desire for risk.  Germany's Hochtief shed 9.5 percent after it slashed its
outlook on an expected big loss at Australian unit Leighton. Lafarge, Holcim and Vinci fell between 1.5 and 1.8 percent. Carmakers were lower after brokers turned bearish on the
sector, with Credit Suisse downgrading Daimler, down 2.7
percent. Renault fell 2.2 percent, after a source close to the
company told Reuters that Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata
had resigned, following an embarrassing fiasco over industrial
espionage allegations. On the upside, some British banks rose after a government
commission's report on the separation of retail operations from
riskier investment banking activities was less demanding than
some had expected. Barclays rose 2.8 percent; state-backed Royal Bank of
Scotland rose 2.3 percent. ""The banks will be breathing a sigh of relief. (Commission
leader John) Vickers and his colleagues have heeded bankers'
warnings and shied away from recommending a total split of
retail and investment banking operations -- the outcome banks
feared the most,"" said Paul Mumford, senior investment director
at Cavendish Asset Management.
 Miners also helped limit the index's losses on strong metals
prices, supported by encouraging China copper imports data.
Heavyweights BHP Billiton and Xstrata were up 1.8 percent and
0.9 percent.  U.S. EARNINGS  Some traders were cautious ahead of the start of the U.S.
first-quarter earnings season, due to be kicked off by aluminium
company Alcoa after markets close on Monday. Investors will look
at companies' outlook statements for indications of the effect
of higher input prices on margins. ""Sales trends in the first quarter will be supportive for
earnings growth. However, investors will pay close attention to
the outlook regarding input costs and margins for the second and
third quarter, and here the picture looks less favourable,"" said
Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at UniCredit. Soaring oil prices and inflation in emerging economies pose
new risks to global recovery but are not yet strong enough to
derail it, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. Concerns over high raw material prices hit soft drinks
bottler Coca-Coca Hellenic, which dropped 2.6 percent to feature
as the biggest faller on the FTSEurofirst 300 index, with
traders highlighting concerns that persistently high oil prices
would burden its costs.  Brent crude prices fell below $125 a barrel on Monday,
pulling back from last week's 32-month peaks, as investors
cautiously eyed an African Union plan to halt the conflict in
Libya.

  (Adds details from Renault statement) By Gilles Guillaume and Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - Renault Chief Operating Officer
Patrick Pelata resigned on Monday, taking the flak for an
embarrassing fiasco that started as a probe into suspected
industrial espionage case and ended as a fraud case. France's Renault fired three executives in January, saying
its high-profile electric vehicle project had been targeted by
an international spy network, but later had to admit it was
tricked, the men did nothing wrong and there was no spying. Renault, which is 15 percent owned by the French state,
accepted Pelata's resignation at an extraordinary board meeting
on Monday to discuss the findings of an audit into the scandal,
the carmaker said on Monday. Morgan Stanley analyst Stuart Pearson said Pelata's
departure was a loss to Renault, although investors would not be
surprised, and the fact that Carlos Ghosn was staying on as
Chief Executive would limit the impact on shares. Ghosn is also Chief Executive of Renault's Japanese alliance
partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd. Renault said Pelata would be given
an unspecified role within the Renault-Nissan alliance. ""Pelata as COO did a solid job of guiding Renault through
the last few years,"" Pearson said, adding that his departure
could hamper the new strategic plan Renault unveiled in
February. ""It does call into question the execution of the strategic
plan that has only just been announced - Pelata would have been
a key architect of that. It's not immediately obvious who could
replace him."" Renault shares closed down 2.2 percent before Renault
confirmed Pelata's resignation.  A number of other senior executives have been relieved of
their functions, including senior executive staff manager
Jean-Yves Coudriou, head of the legal department Christian
Husson and secretary general Laurence Dors. Renault security officials Remi Paigne, Marc Tixador and
Dominique Gevrey -- who is now accused of fraud in the case --
were expected to leave the company, Renault said. Renault has also created an ethics committee, restructured
its compliance committee and will overhaul and modernise its
security department, the company said.  SERIOUS DYSFUNCTIONS French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde earlier told
France Inter radio that any procedural violations would have to
be punished. ""Rules must be respected,"" she said.  Industry Minister Eric Besson also told LCI television
earlier that the audit pointed to ""serious dysfunctions within
the company's management."" Pelata had long been seen as the likely candidate to take
the fall for the debacle.  He tendered his resignation about a month ago, when Renault
apologised to the three executives it wrongly fired in January
and said it would compensate and offer to reinstate them. Ghosn refused to accept his number two's departure at the
time, saying he ""didn't want to add one crisis to another"". Instead, he and Pelata pledged to forgo their 2010 bonuses
and profits from 2011 stock options.Renault also said on Monday it had reached an agreement in
principle with the three wrongly fired executives, without
giving further details. A source close to the company told Reuters that Ghosn and
Pelata's bonus and stock option concessions should be enough to
cover the compensation paid to the three men. Pelata, seen as Ghosn's right-hand man, holds engineering
degrees from two of France's top engineering schools as well as
a PhD in socio-economics. He joined Renault in 1984 as a workshop manager at the Flins
plant near Paris, and rose swiftly through the ranks, becoming a
member of the Renault management committee in 1998.  In 1999, Pelata, a judo enthusiast who also has a pilot's
licence, went to work for Nissan in Tokyo.  Pelata met Ghosn at university, but their different styles
belie their long history.  Pelata, with his sharp suits and rectangular-framed glasses,
is soft spoken, while Ghosn's oratorical style shows he relishes
the reputation as a car industry guru that he earned by
transforming Nissan from a money-loser into a success story. (Reporting by Gilles Guillaume, Dominique Vidalon, Marc

percent * No major impact on French industry from Japan seen so far  
 (Adds more on Renault supply problems) By Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, April 1 (Reuters) - French new passenger car sales
rose 6.1 percent in March, auto makers' association CCFA said on
Friday, as the market benefitted from an expiring programme
allowing car owners to trade in their old models for new. March was the last month expected to show the incentive
scheme's effects, as cars bought before the programme expired in
December could be registered until the end of March. The scrappage scheme, like similar ones launched in many
other markets, boosted car sales after the industry was hit by a
savage downturn. Blain said he expected the French auto market to perform
better than expected in 2011 after a ""very satisfying"" first
quarter, adding that he saw the market declining 8 percent for
the year compared with a previous forecast for a 10 percent dip. Blain said he saw no major impact on the French car industry
in March or April from the wider supply chain problems that have
roiled the industry after the Japan earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear crisis. A spokeswoman for Renault said its production had not yet
been impacted, apart from at a Renault Samsung facility in South
Korea, but that the company was analysing the situation closely. PSA Peugeot Citroen's March sales rose 13.5 percent while
group sales at Renault, where supply problems have hit some
models since the beginning of the year, fell 12.4 percent. Renault brand sales fell 8 percent in March, while low-cost
Dacia brand sales which have boomed in recent months plunged
26.5 percent. CCFA President Patrick Blain told a news conference supply
problems were to blame for the dip. The Renault spokeswoman said some suppliers who cut capacity
because of the industry crisis had not anticipated such a speedy
recovery in demand and were not able to ramp up production
accordingly. The Twingo, Clio Campus, Modus, Megane and Dacia's Sandero
models were affected, and Renault would be compensating 3,000
customers who had not been eligible for the scrappage scheme
because of the delay, the spokeswoman said. Low stocks of vehicles also contributed to the problems in
delivering vehicles, she said. Car makers moved to slash their
inventories of vehicles when the crisis hit, leaving them
overloaded with cars they could not sell. 257,631 new passenger cars were registered overall in France
last month, the CCFA said in a statement. In the first three months of the year, passenger car sales
rose 8.9 percent. Sales of light commercial vehicles rose 4.7 percent last
month, and 8.6 percent in January to March, the CCFA said.

1355,"Mar 31, 2011 05:36AM ET",UPDATE 4-Nissan: No plan to combine firm with Renault,nan," * Says CEO Ghosn was misinterpreted in Nikkei interview * Nissan shares close up 1.0 percent, Renault up 1.2 percent 
 (Recasts, adds Renault shares, analyst comment) By Chang-Ran Kim March 31 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor and French partner Renault
 are not planning to combine under a holding company as part of
the planned evolution of their alliance, the Japanese carmaker
said, denying a report. The Nikkei said on Thursday that Carlos Ghosn, chief
executive of both companies, had told the business daily he was
looking at putting Nissan and Renault under a single umbrella,
and transition to that structure could take place in 2-3 years. ""There are currently no plans to form a single holding
company for both Renault and Nissan,"" Nissan said, adding the
Nikkei article was a misinterpretation of a wide-ranging
interview in which Ghosn said the corporate structure of the
Renault-Nissan Alliance would remain dynamic. ""Ghosn did not say or imply that Renault and Nissan are
'leaning toward establishing a holding company' as the
publication reported,"" it said. Nissan shares closed up 1 percent at 737 yen, while the
broader Japanese stock market rose 0.5 percent. Renault shares
were up 1.2 percent at 0920 GMT, outperforming a 0.2 percent
lower European autos sector. ""It is more of a risk than anything else because if you look
at what happened with Porsche when they changed the structure
from an operating company to a holding company they had to incur
a massive tax charge,"" said one analyst. ""If it was happening I would see it as a risk and because it
is not happening I would see it as a positive,"" he said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said in a research
note they did not think the March 11 Japan earthquake had
changed Nissan's ability to pay a dividend in coming years, and
Renault's sales volumes had been a positive surprise this year. A sell-off of Renault shares since the start of 2011 because
of fears over the impact of the disaster in Japan,
disappointment about a strategic plan unveiled in February and
negative news about its debunked spying claims was overdone, the
analysts wrote, reiterating their ""buy"" recommendation. Ghosn has been under pressure from Renault shareholders to
review the capital structure of the Franco-Japanese alliance,
with about $17 billion of a financially weak Renault's capital
tied up in its 43.4 percent stake in Nissan. Renault's market
capitalisation is currently $16 billion. Nissan and the French state each own 15 percent of Renault. Ghosn told Reuters in an interview last month that
addressing the financial market's unhappiness with the capital
structure was his biggest challenge, adding he hoped to come up
with a solution within three years.     In his interview with the Nikkei, Ghosn repeated his
stance that shareholders on both sides of the partnership must
be taken into consideration, while ruling out an outright merger
he said always led to a loss of identity on one side. Some analysts have suggested much closer ties, including a
full merger, would reduce the inefficiency of running two
separate companies, while others have said Renault should cut
its stake in Nissan. Renault needs a third of Nissan to retain a
controlling stake. The Nikkei said Ghosn's plan called for AvtoVAZ, Russia's
leading automaker and 25 percent-owned by Renault, and Romanian
group Dacia and South Korean Renault Samsung Motors -- both
subsidiaries of the French automaker -- to move under the
proposed umbrella. Nissan and Renault have plans to take a combined stake in
AvtoVAZ of at least 50 percent with Nissan taking more than half
of the remaining 25 percent, Ghosn told Reuters last month. Placing leading local firms under an enlarged group's
umbrella would be advantageous in expanding local operations
while reducing expenses for building factories and establishing
sales networks, the Nikkei said. Nissan sold a record 4.08 million vehicles in 2010, with
Chinese sales hitting 1 million for a first time and surpassing
figures for Japan and the United States. Brazil, India and
Russia are also key markets, the report said.

dealer
 By Antoni Slodkowski	 TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average held on
to the previous day's solid gains on Thursday and briefly hit
its highest since the post-quake sell-off, helped by year-end
window dressing, while strong U.S. data bolstered the global
outlook and a weaker yen boosted exporters.	 But the benchmark struggled to move decisively higher, as
foreign investors were reluctant to buy shares they viewed as
too expensive with the market slowly approaching key technical
resistance.	 Shares of Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the
owner of the quake-stricken nuclear plant, bounced back 8.6
percent, lifting stocks related to the utility such as
shareholders Dai-ichi Life Insurance and Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group by more than 1 percent each.	 Traders said TEPCO's shares were mostly bought by
speculators and short-term investors, with some citing funds
trading in oil and Chinese funds.	 Foreign investors sold 13.3 billion yen of Japanese stocks
last week after record net buying of 893.2 billion yen the week
before, government data showed on Thursday.	 ""March 31 means everything for institutional investors.
They're begging to push prices higher even by one yen,"" said
Masayoshi Okamoto, head of dealing at Jujiya Securities,
attributing gains in the market to year-end window dressing.	 ""From tomorrow on everyone is going to think about March
2012 and trading will begin anew with that date in mind. But for
now, even the smallest gains will seem huge for players who lost
so much in the post-quake sell-off.""	 By midday the benchmark Nikkei average was almost
flat, down 2.88 points at 9,705.91. The broader Topix 
was also little changed, at 865.94.	 Investors bought back underweight shares of banks, which are
among the hardest-hit since Japan's March 11 disaster. Tokyo's
subindex of banking stocks has lost 11.3 percent
since the quake.	 Thomson Reuters data shows banking shares trade at a
price-to-book ratio of 0.7, below 1.1 for the Nikkei index. 	 Major banks, some of which are major lenders to TEPCO, have
been aggressively sold off on mounting worries over the
utility's debt of around $91 billion.	  OUT OF STEAM	 ""The Nikkei ran out of steam as active buying seen in the
futures market, possibly by public funds, slowed down,"" Takashi
Ohba, senior strategist at Okasan Securities. 	 Market players said foreigners stepped aside when the market
slowly closed in on the Nikkei's 200-moving day average at
9,820. 	 ""The market is still cautious about the outlook due to
concerns about the fate of the nuclear plant. Uncertainty over
the power shortage and worries over falling consumption also
should weigh on shares,"" added Ohba. 	 The dollar rose to around 83.19 yen on Wednesday, a
level last seen on March 11, when it initially fell after
Japan's earthquake. It retreated to around 82.81 yen on
Thursday.	 Japanese shares have shed 7 percent since the March 11
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear safety crisis erupted, triggered
the biggest two-day rout in the market since 1987. In contrast,
the MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan has
gained 5 percent. 	 Shares in Nissan Motor climbed 1 percent, roughly
in line with other blue-chip exporters, after the automaker
denied a media report that CEO Carlos Ghosn said it and Renault
SA plan to form a single company [ID:nL3E7EV049]	 ""There are currently no plans to form a single holding
company for both Renault and Nissan,"" Nissan said in a
statement.	 Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co surged 5.2 percent to
768 yen in active trade after the firm said it had signed a 10
billion yen licensing deal that gives Takeda Pharmaceutical Co
 exclusive marketing rights to its antipsychotic drug in
most of Europe. Dainippon said it will book this one-time
payment as sales and profit for the current fiscal year.

 (Adds anti-trust service denial, share price, analyst comment) By Gleb Stolyarov MOSCOW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Russia's anti-trust body on
Friday denied reports that Germany's Daimler had applied to
raise its stake in loss-making truckmaker Kamaz, but investors
retained hope the deal could happen. Russian carmakers -- hit by slumping demand during the
country's first recession in a decade -- are increasingly
looking to foreign partners to revitalise the sector and
persuade Russians their vehicles are as good as ones made
abroad. Traders and analysts said greater involvement from Daimler
would boost performance and save Russia's largest truck maker
from coming under state control. Kamaz shares jumped 25 percent on the original report by
Russia news agencies that Daimler was seeking to raise its 10
percent stake, but retained most of the gains after the denial
from the anti-trust body. ""There is no request to buy a stake in Kamaz,"" Irina
Kashunina, spokeswoman for the service, told Reuters. ""But there is a request from a company ... affiliated to
Daimler to increase a stake in Fuso KAMAZ Trucks Rus,"" she
added, referring to a joint venture between Kamaz and Daimler
set up this month. The request was granted. Kamaz and Daimler declined to comment when contacted by
Reuters. Kamaz on Thursday reported a 2 billion rouble ($68 million)
first-half loss, as the recession battered the construction and
cement industries which provide most of its clients. ""They could get access to some newer technologies (from
Daimler), modernise. And it's not just technologies, it's also
management experience,"" said Vladimir Bespalov, analyst at VTB
Capital in Moscow.  ""The hope (that Daimler will increase its stake) remains,
this possibility exists, although if it is realised, it is more
likely not to happen in the near future."" Russia's bigger car maker AvtoVAZ is seeking new ventures
with shareholder Renault and Sberbank is looking for domestic
industrial partners to assemble cars in Russia after a planned
purchase of a stake in Germany's Opel. Daimler, which signed a $250 million deal to acquire 10
percent of Kamaz last December, has an option to increase its
stake to 23 percent. But the German company has felt the effects of the global
economic crisis, and losses at Kamaz led investors to think that
Daimler may not exercise that option. Instead Kamaz looked set to come under state control, with
sources telling Reuters last month that state conglomerate
Russian Technologies is in talks with investment bank Troika
Dialog to acquire a 13 percent stake that would give it control.
 ""On this news (of Daimler stake increase), people decided to
lift Kamaz's shares, betting on long-term cooperation between
Kamaz and Daimler and, consequently, on the improvement of its
performance,"" Infina's trader Yevgeny Volkov said. Yuliy Matevosov, analyst with Aton, said the market was
anticipating that Daimler would pay the same price for the 13
percent stake that it paid for the 10 percent at the end of last

 (Adds details from statement, background) PARIS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Renault said positive trends
carried over into the third quarter from the second and sales
declined less sharply than earlier in the year. The French carmaker said it would increase production by
more than 50 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the
same period last year, when carmakers were forced to drastically
slash production in the face of plunging demand. The group confirmed its full-year target of generating
positive free cash flow.  In February, Renault dropped an ambitious full year
operating margin goal it had in place before the crisis, when --
like other carmakers -- its sales slumped towards the end of
last year. Renault said it was ""well-positioned"" to meet its target of
a reduction in stocks of about 1 billion euros ($1.5 billion)
for the year as a whole.
 The group's third quarter sales fell 11.3 percent
year-on-year to 8.102 billion euros. Six analysts polled by
Reuters journalists had expected an average of 8.363 billion
euros for the sales. Renault said the sales decline was more moderate than in
previous quarters -- in the first quarter sales had fallen 30.8
percent year, and in the second quarter by 16.9 percent.  Rival French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen last week posted
third quarter sales of 11.782 billion euros, as scrapping
schemes boosted sales in major markets, meaning that the
year-on-year decline of 7.7 percent was less sharp than in
previous quarters.  (Reporting by Helen Massy-Beresford; Additional Reporting by

German Dax +5.00.European Trade: European markets are trading in the green, assisted somewhat by momentum from the news that the South Korean economy grew more than expected in the third quarter. The same news report helped most Asian markets advance, while it offered some support to the S&P futures.The German Dax is trading up 0.70%, leading the gains in European trade, after absorbing a report showed that German Consumer Confidence fell for the first time in 9 months. Closely following the German Dax moves higher is the French CAC 40 index, as both advanced on the gains seen in the automaker sector. The Eastern European markets are trading in the red, but the declines are relatively small. S&P futures traded between the 1075.00 and the 1080.00 areas during the overnight session. Both areas acted as important intra-day swing points in recent trade and have significant technical importance to both bullish and bearish outlooks in the near-term. The 1075.00 area has held as support on S&P futures for almost two weeks now. A break, and daily chart close, below this area would extend the current downtrend, and would probably send the global equity markets lower.Sector Moves: The automobile & parts, and the chemicals sectors saw the strongest gains in Europe, both surging around 1%.

 (Adds share price, analyst comment) By Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot
Citroen said third-quarter revenues slowed less sharply than in
previous quarters as it boosted market share in Europe, where
governments launched car buying incentives. Peugeot Citroen shares fell over 7 percent in early trading
as the revenues fell short of analyst expectations buoyed by
forecast-beating earnings from German rival Daimler on Monday. European car makers have cut production and reduced costs
after auto sales dropped by their biggest fall for 15 years in
2008 and government incentive schemes have helped attracting
clients to showrooms again, and order new cars. This has especialy boosted smaller models, such as a large
part of the Peugeot and Citroen line-up, but not the bigger cars
such as the C6 or Peugeot 607. ""What we have today is a revenue disappointment and no
obvious sign of the large production re-ramp that many have
anticipated,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. ""We would expect a dose of profit-taking today.""
Third-quarter revenue at the group fell 7.7 percent,
compared with a 24.9 percent year-on-year fall in the first
quarter and an 18.9 percent drop in the second, Peugeot said in
a statement on Wednesday. The carmaker said it felt the benefit of scrapping schemes,
whereby drivers get a discount on new models when they scrap
their old vehicle. This applied in France, Italy and the UK, but
especially in Germany, Europe's biggest car market. European markets were mixed in the third quarter, however,
with a negative impact from central and eastern European
markets, the company said. The overall European car market decreased just 0.3 percent
in the third quarter, compared with a 14.4 percent decline in
the first six months of the year, Peugeot said. Chief Executive Philippe Varin said last month he expected
the European market to be down around 10 percent this year. Peugeot increased overall market share in Europe to 13.4
percent compared with 12.9 percent a year earlier. The market for light commercial vehicles remained ""very
weak"" in the quarter, Peugeot said, adding that it increased
market share to 22.1 percent from 19.2 percent in this segment. Inventories of unsold vehicles -- a major cash concern for
carmakers when the crisis hit last year -- decreased by 36
percent to 400,000 vehicles compared with 628,000 at the start
of the year, the company said.
 SHARES DROP Shares in Peugeot were 5.65 percent lower at 22.85 euros by
0904 GMT, making them the biggest fallers on a 1.77 percent
weaker DJ Stoxx European autos index. They also led declines on
the French blue-chip CAC 40 index. ""The factors behind our view that 2010 can see positive
surprises remain intact; we see nothing incremental
today to improve the case,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts added. Daimler on Monday posted a fall in third-quarter earnings
before interest and tax to 470 million euros that beat the
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus estimate of 141 million. It
said it expected free cash flow to be positive for the year. On Tuesday, French car parts makers Faurecia, 70 percent
owned by Peugeot, and Valeo made upbeat statements about the
rest of the year. Valeo said it was increasing its second-half production
forecast after a third-quarter profit, and Faurecia raised its
outlook for second-half sales. PSA's domestic rival, Renault, is due to report
third-quarter sales on Oct. 29. Italian auto maker Fiat SpA is
due to post results later on Wednesday.

1387,"Oct 20, 2009 10:33PM ET",AUTOSHOW-UPDATE 2-Nissan: can maintain profitability in US,nan," CHIBA, Japan, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor is confident it
can protect its profitability in the face of both poor U.S.
demand and a strong yen, although it is currently using only
60-70 percent of its North American output capacity, executives
said on Wednesday. Nissan may start exporting to such ""dollar countries"" as the
Middle East from the United States to help it cope with these
issues, which would mean replacing shipments from Japan, Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn told reporters. ""I don't think the U.S. use of capacity is a headache for us,
because not only it's going to serve for the United States but
also for exports,"" he said at a media roundtable. ""I have absolutely no worry about the use of capacity in the
United States."" Without such exports, Nissan would need the U.S. market to
total 10.5 million vehicles in annual sales for its North
American business to be profitable, Executive Vice President
Carlos Tavares said. The U.S. market is widely expected to reach that figure this
year, but that would be down sharply from 16.2 million units in
2007 and 13.2 million last year. ""Our plants are at a point where we can be profitable with a
total U.S. market of 10.5 million vehicles,"" Tavares told a small
group of reporters on the sidelines of the Tokyo Motor Show. He said so far in 2009 Nissan had managed to keep its market
share in the United States unchanged from last year without the
use of heavy, profit-eroding sales incentives. Tavares also said the firm's North American profitability
would not be affected even if the dollar weakened against the
Japanese currency to 80 yen. ""We have been preparing (for currency swings), and among the
three (top) Japanese (carmakers) I would say we are the most
advanced,"" Tavares said, noting Nissan's strategy of seeking
low-cost sources for parts procurement around the world. On Wednesday, the dollar was trading around 90.80 yen.
Earlier this month, the greenback fell near its January low of
87.10 yen, which was the lowest since 1995. FRUITS IN Q2 Nissan Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga said he could
not comment on where results would land for the financial first
half that ended on Sept. 30. But he noted that various emergency
cost-cutting measures continued to bear fruit after the company
reported a surprise profit in the April-June quarter. ""We're seeing the fruits of the steps we've taken,"" Shiga
told a small group of reporters, naming among them reductions in
labour and other fixed costs. Shiga noted that Nissan's global sales had also turned up in
September versus the year-earlier month, thanks largely to
faster-than-expected growth in China, the world's biggest auto
market. But he cautioned that the sales growth around the world was
being supported heavily by government incentives, and that there
was a risk that the industry could hit a second bottom when these
ran out. ""There are big fears in the industry for this possibility,""
Shiga said. Nissan shares closed down 1.0 percent at 666 yen, while
shares of Nissan's French partner Renault were down 4.2 percent
at 35.2350 euros. Ghosn is also head of Renault.

Russian automaker AvtoVAZ  gathered on Saturday in a
peaceful protest to renew calls for the nationalisation of the
firm, which lost $655 million in the first half of this year. ""We demand that Putin is appointed president of AvtoVAZ, let
him run the factory as a second job,"" Russian parliamentarian
Anatoly Ivanov told the crowd. Estimates of its size varied widely. Its organisers, the independent Unity trade union, estimated
that 3,000 people attended, while Russian news agencies cited
Interior Ministry estimates of roughly 700. Both figures represent a tiny fraction of the Soviet-era
plant's 102,000-strong workforce, indicating that recent
government efforts to avert unrest in this industrial city on
the Volga River have been successful. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin earlier this month dispatched
his deputy, Igor Shuvalov, to the plant to discuss investments
by minority stakeholder Renault  and reassure workers
alarmed over the company's plans to cut 27,600 jobs.
[ID:nL6262057] ""It will be a thought-out programme. No-one will attempt any
job cuts without prior consultations with the factory's
workers,"" Shuvalov said at the time, dismissing AvtoVAZ's layoff
figure as ""lies."" It remains unclear how many jobs will be lost at the plant
this year, though it appears that 5,000 administrative workers
and managers will be let go from December. Togliatti, one of Russia's many single-industry cities, is a
key test of the Russian government's ability to manage the
ongoing crisis. Thus far, sporadic protests have not led to the type of
unrest seen in the northwestern Russian town of Pikalyovo, where
workers blocked a motorway in June to protest over unpaid
salaries. [IDnL4450983] Putin personally visited the town to order Oleg Deripaska,
once Russia's richest man, to restart the factories, but the
government has since pressured regional authorities to maintain
stability without direct intervention by the Kremlin. Occasional protests have been ongoing in Togliatti since
August when AvtoVAZ unveiled plans to introduce a 20-hour work
week from September and cut monthly wages to about 21,931
roubles ($744). That protest, also organised by the Unity union, first
called for the plant to return to state ownership.
[ID:nL6144441] Government-held conglomerate Russian Technologies already
owns about 25 percent, as does investment bank Troika Dialog. AvtoVAZ's official ASM trade union, which represents the
majority of the workers, has not supported any of the rallies,
and it earlier this week told them not to attend the Saturday
meeting. (Writing by Alfred Kueppers; Editing by Toby Chopra)

 (Adds background, detail) UMEA, Sweden, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The top executive of world
number two truck maker Volvo said on Thursday the European truck
market had reached a floor around the start of the third quarter
but the pace of recovery was gradual. Truck makers have seen demand nosedive due to global
recession and a credit crunch that has made it difficult for
buyers to fund new purchases. Chief Executive Leif Johansson said conditions in Volvo's
largest market were unlikely to worsen from very low levels and
were showing signs of a gradual improvement. ""It's time to say we have reached the bottom,"" he told
Reuters on the sidelines of an EU competition meeting in
northern Sweden. ""We have bottomed out somewhere in the second and early
third quarter, but I think it (the European market) is improving
off of terribly low levels,"" he said, adding that the pace of
recovery was ""gradual"". Volvo, which sells trucks under brands such as Renault,
Nissan Diesel and Mack, last month said that truck deliveries in
Europe had fallen 72 percent year-on-year, while they dropped 33
percent in North America. Johannson said the United States had also reached a floor
but that he had not yet seen signs of an upturn in that market. ""It's fair to say we have reached the bottom there too, but
we don't see much of an upturn in North America, it's still too
early to say,"" Johansson said. The Swedish vehicles maker, which reports third-quarter
results on Oct. 23, has said it expects the European truck
market to halve or worse this year and sees the already weak
North American market to dip a further 30 to 40 percent. Volvo's rival Daimler, the world's biggest truck marker,
last week said it saw evidence the U.S. truck market had
bottomed but remained cautious about the pace of recovery.

 (Adds details, deputy finance minister, background) By Yulia Komleva MOSCOW, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Indebted Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ
, which this month admitted to making poor quality cars,
suffered a tenfold increase in net losses during the first six
months of the year as sales halved of its Lada model.
 Russia's largest carmaker lost 19.4 billion roubles ($655.4
million) in the first half of 2009 and is banking on another
round of support from the state and its 25 percent shareholder
Renault to keep its Soviet-era plant running. Its Moscow-traded shares fell more than 2 percent on a day
when the wider market rose. ""A decline in sales and car production volumes has led to
significant losses,"" AvtoVAZ said in a statement on Monday. Its
net loss in the first half of 2008 was 1.9 billion roubles. AvtoVAZ plans to cut more than 27,000 jobs, or a quarter of
its workforce, to cope with plummeting car sales during Russia's
first recession in a decade. In a presentation for the government obtained by Reuters
last week, AvtoVAZ said it had asked the state for an additional
70 billion roubles ($2.4 billion) and admitted it was making
cars of poor quality, blaming this on suppliers. AvtoVAZ said revenue almost halved to 53.1 billion roubles
in the first half of 2009 from 98.5 billion a year ago,
calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards. The company sold 169,000 Lada cars in the six months to the
end of June, compared with 378,000 in the same year-ago period. Car sales in Russia as a whole fell 52 percent year-on-year
in September. Before the crisis, Russia had been forecast to
overtake Germany as Europe's biggest car market.
 STATE SUPPORT Russia's government, wary of simmering unrest in one-factory
towns hit by the financial crisis, has made social stability a
priority in places such as Togliatti, the city on the Volga
river built to serve the AvtoVAZ car plant. The job cuts planned by AvtoVAZ would be the largest round
of redundancies in a single Russian city since the crisis began. AvtoVAZ said that, as of June 30, its total debt stood at
59.9 billion roubles, including 58.2 billion short-term debt.
Short-term liabilities, which also include money owed to
suppliers and taxes due, amounted to 105.5 billion roubles. Renault, which pain $1 billion for its 25 percent stake, is
prepared to invest more, though not necessarily in cash.
Developing models on AvtoVAZ production lines to replace
outdated cars was one of several possible options, a Renault
spokeswoman said on Oct. 6. Deputy Finance Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday
another option to rescue the company would be for state-owned
creditors Sberbank and VTB to exchange their debts for a stake
in the company. A decision on this could be taken by the end of the month,
Novak said. By 1325 GMT, shares in AvtoVAZ were down 2.1 percent at
16.52 roubles, against a rise of 3 percent on the broader MICEX
index.

In this case, traders may be looking for a final move up of an expanding diagonal triangle with the first target shown around the 1090 area, followed by a second around the 100% Fibonacci projection zone of the wave A distance.Sector Moves: Even though the rally was triggered by Philips’ results, which is a member of the personal & household goods sector, the best performing sector in Europe is automobiles & parts, which is up 2.2%. Within the sector, the best performing company is France’s Renault, which jumped close to 5% after rumors surfaced about joint projects with Russia’ AvtoVAZ. Renault’s news created a strong positive momentum in the European carmakers, with Peugeot, BMW and Volkswagen gaining more than 2%. As a note, the automobiles & parts sector was Europe’s best gainer over the last week of trading. Other important gains came from the telecommunication and from the technology sectors, while the heavy-weights financial and raw material companies only posted modest gains, of 0.80 and 0.55% respectively. Economic Moves: The report calendar is clear in Monday trade. Crude oil for November delivery was recently trading at $72.60 per barrel, higher by $0.85.

1392,"Oct 05, 2009 11:03AM ET",Putin says state to commit more money to AvtoVAZ,nan," * Russia ready to fund restructuring * Renault gives no firm pledge to join suit * Government to meet on Tuesday to discuss new measures
 By Darya Korsunskaya MOSCOW, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Monday pledged more funds to help restructure troubled
car maker AvtoVAZ but failed to secure a firm promise from
shareholder Renault to join the plan. On Friday, Putin delivered an ultimatum to Renault to either
help finance AvtoVAZ or see its 25 percent stake reduced. On Monday he met AvtoVAZ directors, including Renault Senior
Vice-President Christian Esteve. ""I would like to see all
shareholders take an equal part in this work and all
(participants) can be sure that the government will do its
utmost to ensure the interests of all shareholders,"" Putin said. Esteve told Putin, Russia's most influential politician,
that Renault was keen to develop in Russia, but refrained from
making firm pledges. ""Our main desire is to remain your partners. I think that
all decisions taken by AvtoVAZ are very painful but necessary.
You can rely on Renault. We feel socially responsible and that
goes for AvtoVAZ's business plan too,"" he said. ""We will work out a new model line for AvtoVAZ. For that we
need good parts suppliers,"" he added. Renault bought a quarter of state-run AvtoVAZ for over $1
billion two years ago. Under Russian legislation, only a stake
of 25 percent or more gives a shareholder the power to block
board decisions. AvtoVAZ has said it would have to cut a quarter of its
staff, or 27,600 people, in the largest round of job cuts in a
single Russian city, in Togliatti. The cuts, which come amid a 44 percent decline in sales of
AvtoVAZ's Lada, will test the ability of Putin's government to
avoid unrest as a sharp recession follows a decade of boom. AvtoVAZ, a Soviet-era behemoth that still produces some
clunky Lada models on outdated 1960s equipment, has grown used
to decades of state cash injections to stay afloat. Hopes of modernisation soared when Renault bought the stake,
but the global financial crisis delayed many of Russia's
restructuring plans as budget revenues fell. Putin visited AvtoVAZ six months ago to pledge $1 billion in
state support to avoid what he described as the General Motors
scenario, when 34,000 people were fired.. ""AvtoVAZ needs restructuring,"" Putin said on Monday. ""We all understand that, if we do nothing, the enterprise
will be sick for a long time and then will simply cease to
exist. We can't afford this happening."" He did not say how much more money the government would
commit in addition to the 25 billion roubles ($830 million)
already disbursed. A government commission led by Putin's first deputy, Igor
Shuvalov, will meet on Tuesday to discuss measures to help all
Russian car producers.

low on Friday, extending the previous day's sharp losses, as
investors were nervy before the U.S. jobs figures after data
this week cast doubt about the strength of the recovery. By 0757 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 percent at
971.93 points, after falling 1.6 percent on Thursday to a
three-week closing low. The index, posting its best quarterly gains in nearly 10
years in the last quarter, was on track for a third day of
losses. ""We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while,""
said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, in Frankfrut. ""The third quarter performed pretty strongly. With the
beginning of the fourth quarter, we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest."" Banks, which have rallied 160 percent since March, were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture. KBC, UBS, Barclays, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas, Deutsche
Bank, Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 1.1 to 6.8 percent. But HSBC put on 0.6 percent, as traders said the bank was
the most defensive in the sector. Heavyweight commodity shares, which have also performed
strongly in the rally, were out of favour. BP, Royal Dutch Shell
, BG Group and Total dropped 0.4 to 1.1 percent. Among miners, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American,
Xstrata, Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0.3 to 2.1
percent. All eyes will be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls data, due at
1230 GMT, for further evidence of the pace of the recovery in
the world's largest economy. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180,000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216,000 jobs in
August, while the unemployment rate is seen at 9.8 percent,
compared a 9.7 percent rate the prior month. The dollar held steady against most major currencies with
investors sitting tight ahead of the jobs data. The pan-European index, which slumped 45 percent last year,
has rallied nearly 51 percent since hitting a floor in early
March, and is up 16.8 percent so far this year.  LOW RISK APPETITE The VDAX-NEW volatility index was up 6 percent after hitting
a four-week closing high on Thursday. The higher the index, the
lower is investors' appetite for risky assets. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.7 percent,
Germany's DAX fell 0.8 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 1.3
percent. Overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500
 suffered their worst one-day fall in three months, while
Japan's Nikkei average fell 2.5 percent. ""Consumer expectations are now extremely stretched relative
to the dismal reality. This also occurred during the early 1990s
credit crunch,"" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a
note. ""Back then expectations also ran up far ahead of reality.
Interestingly, after the recession had ended in March 1991,
excessively optimistic expectations slumped three more times
until muddling reality caught up with excessive hope. Markets
still have too much hope."" European automakers were also weak after September U.S. auto
sales tumbled by 23 percent as showrooms emptied after the
government-funded boom from the ""cash for clunkers"" programme. Daimler, Renault, Peugeot, BMA and Volvo were off 0.4 to 2.8
percent, but Volkswagen advanced 0.8 percent. Alcatel-Lucent, ASML Holding, Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2.4 to 5.2 percent, leading the tech
sector lower. Carlsberg eased 4.5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded
the brewer to ""sell"" from ""hold"".

investment to ensure it emerges strong from the financial
crisis, so it will not re-introduce capital controls, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin said on Friday. Russia resisted calls for capital controls, choosing instead
to spend $200 billion of reserves in late 2008-early 2009 on
keeping the rouble from weakening too quickly as it adjusted to
lower oil prices and the country's first recession in a decade.
""We will keep this liberal regime, which is one of the
fundamental reasons for investment in Russia's economy,"" Putin
told an economic forum in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi. Businessmen attending the forum were upbeat about prospects
in Russia's resource-rich economy, now that the worst of the
global slowdown seems to have passed and investors are looking
for fresh avenues for their cash. David Bonderman, founding partner of one of the world's
largest private equity funds TPG [TPG.UL], said he is looking
for opportunities for about $30 billion in uninvested capital
and is ""cautiously optimistic"" about Russia. [ID:nLI351370] ""We have about $60 billion of capital, half of it is
uninvested and we are looking for opportunities,"" he said. General Electric Co , the largest U.S. conglomerate,
listed Russia among its priorities [ID:nLI179221], adding that
it is in talks about possible projects with Russian Railways and
gas export monopoly Gazprom . [ID:MOS005538] John Mack, outgoing CEO of Morgan Stanley  told
Reuters he was confident about Russia [ID:nLH695446] and later
especially highlighted pharmaceuticals. [ID:nMOS005538] Putin said he hoped the purchase of Germany's Opel by a
consortium including Russia's largest lender Sberbank
 and carmaker Avtovaz  would set a precedent
for fruitful partnerships with foreign companies.
""We are open to foreign investments, of course...We need not
so much the money, and not just the money, but first of all the
knowledge and the experience that key international players
have,"" he said. The Russian economy has passed the worst of the crisis, with
growth averaging 0.5 percent a month since June, Putin said.  The government should start thinking about how it will
unwind anti-crisis stimulus measures and diversify the economy
from natural resources to cushion it from future turmoil, he
added. Investment will be key here.  TRAFFIC JAMS Avtovaz chief Igor Komarov told the forum that his company
plans to create a joint venture with Renault  and its
Japanese alliance partner Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> to produce
car parts. [ID:nLI158779] ""Russia needs to fight for direct investment,"" German Gref,
Sberbank's chief executive said. Although Russia has been much harder hit by the global
crisis than other major emerging markets such as China or India,
Putin said his country had some advantages over the others. ""One of the main advantages of China is stability...A
possibility for financial authorities to make decisions without
looking back at political situations. Some people like it, some
don't, but for investors it is an advantage. But there are some
currency restrictions,"" he said. ""In Russia there are some problems but some pluses,
including the liberal financial regime."" But some remained sceptical about how far Russia -- which in
the past had a chequered relationship with foreign investors,
especially in strategic sectors -- would really open up. ""The suspicion will obviously linger that any attempt now to
woo foreign investment is a transitory move, while Russia is in
need of capital/funding,"" RBS analyst Tim Ash said in a note. ""But once global markets, and commodity markets pick up this
desire to really open up to foreign investment will again fall
by the wayside in favour of Russian, and in particularly Russian
state interests."" Russian businessmen, including metals tycoon Vladimir
Potanin, said they are also prepared to invest [ID:nLI255283]
but some said they have no intention to share their profits with
foreign investors. ""There is not enough room here even for us,"" Vladimir
Yevtushenkov, CEO of Systema, which holds stakes in a number of
technology companies, told Vesti television.  Foreign companies at the forum also noted ongoing problems
in Russia, from a lack of transparency to more basic issues. ""Reduce traffic jams, seriously,"" Michael Calvey,
co-managing partner of private equity fund Baring Vostok Capital
Partners, said when asked what would make investment easier.

carmaker, said on Monday it would cut 5,000 jobs from a
workforce that has already protested against cutbacks.  AvtoVAZ has been under intense government pressure in recent
months not to lay off workers. The cutbacks account for 5 percent of its entire staff,
according to an AvtoVAZ announcement.  ""The order (to cut jobs) has revised the staff list ... The
overall reduction will amount to about 5,000 people,"" it said in
a statement.     A source close to AvtoVAZ, which is part-owned by French
carmaker Renault, told Reuters earlier on Monday the company
would start cutting jobs from Dec. 14. Car sales in Russia have more than halved this year as the
country's first recession in a decade forces consumers to rein
in spending. AvtoVAZ cut the working week and halted production
completely during August. Last month hundreds of workers
demanded the company be nationalised amid salary cuts and
speculation that a quarter of jobs could be cut. The company also said it would restore the normal working
week from Dec. 14 after the relevant order was signed by AvtoVAZ
President Igor Komarov on Monday. The Russian government is pooling its large stakes in
several major automotive firms including AvtoVAZ and KamAZ into
a holding company that will operate under the umbrella of
Russian Technologies.  Analysts have said that the stake in Opel that Russia's
Sberbank is now set to acquire from General Motors may also be
included in the new automotive holding.  Sberbank is helping finance the bid for Germany's Opel put
forward by Canadian auto parts maker Magna.

1396,"Sep 14, 2009 05:39AM ET",AUTOSHOW-INTERVIEW-Electric cars to spark Better Place profits,nan," FRANKFURT, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Better Place, a
California-based company building a global network of charging
stations for the electric car industry, expects to break even in
its first market within roughly a year after launching its
business there, founder and Chief Executive Shai Agassi said. ""This might be in mid to late 2012,"" he told Reuters ahead
of the Frankfurt auto show. Better Place customers subscribe to monthly plans giving
them enough power to travel a specified distance by electric
car. Agassi expects to earn fat margins from selling mileage to
drivers, which will generate revenues that exceed the company's
costs for the large lithium-ion batteries and power. Better Place wants to fully launch services in its pioneer
market Israel in mid-2011, investing $150 million in 70-100
battery exchange stations and thousands of charge spots. A few hundred customers can sign up for trials initially,
and after that at least 1,000 new customers are expected per
month. ""There will be two charge spots per subscriber, one at home
and one at work and we will put 20,000 to 30,000 spots in public
areas, and those will grow over time,"" Agassi said. ""Breakeven in most countries is to be attained when we get
1-2 percent of the car population switched to electric. In
Israel that is somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000 cars,"" he
said.  BIGGER BETTER PLACE After Israel, Better Place wants to expand to Australia,
wind-power strong Denmark, the oil-dependent state of Hawaii and
U.S. environmental leader California. While investments in Denmark will total about $150 million,
they will be at about $200 million in Australia, Agassi said. ""We are now in the middle of capital formation in Israel and
Australia,"" Agassi said. ""It is not too hard to raise capital
for this business."" ""We have raised $135 million in Denmark,"" Agassi said,
adding that Denmark's biggest utility Dong has taken a stake in
Better Place Denmark -- a model which is expected for other
regions as well. Nonetheless, he said an IPO would not be on the table for
another couple of years. Before the global crisis hit the automotive market, Better
Place and its partner Renault had been discussing a possible
shareholding for the French auto group in the Californian
startup, Agassi said. He added that he did not expect an investment soon. ""It is
hard to see that car companies would invest in anything other
then their core business right now."" For customers -- who will get their first chance to see the
full Better Place technology and the Renault e-car at the auto
show -- switching to the climate-friendly way of driving will
pay out immediately, Agassi said.  ""The car will be cheaper than its gasoline counterpart. For
driving per kilometre you pay the same or less."" This would not
change with sinking oil prices, he added. (Reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by David Cowell)

However, further confirmation will still be needed before that builds into something sustainable. The trading volume in Europe had been very light. The mining and the commodity sectors were among the worst performers in Europe, just one day after they helped the U.K. FTSE to reach a new high for the current year. The same was the case on the German Dax, where BASF led the declines together with ThyssenKrupp AG, after unconfirmed sources have said that the company may lose as much as 2 billions this year. The positives came from carmakers, who posted very strong gains in Europe, especially in the German Dax and in the French CAC 40, after BMW and MAN were upgraded by analysts. BMW, Peugeot and Renault are up between 3.5% and 5% in Wednesday trade, on a day when most stocks moved side-ways.Overnight, the U.K. FTSE fell 6.02 points (0.12%) to 4,941.32, while the German Dax declined 12.68 points (0.23%) to 5,469.05.Crude oil for October delivery was recently trading at $70.90 per barrel, lower by $0.20. Gold for October delivery was recently trading lower by $5.10 to $994.70."

trade on Wednesday, slipping back from their highest close in
nearly 11 months, tracking a decline in Asia and as metals
prices weighed on mining stocks. At 0846 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
European shares was down 0.3 percent at 974.95 points, after
rising for three days. The European benchmark index approached its highest close in
11 months on Tuesday, and is up 51 percent from its lifetime low
of March 9, as investors have become more confident on the
prospects for economic recovery. Miners gave back some of Tuesday's gains, as gold prices
 slipped below $1,000 an ounce, and copper prices were
also weaker. Antofagasta , Lonmin , Rio Tinto  and
Vedanta Resources  were down between 0.8 and 4.4 percent. ""Markets are testing the post-recovery highs. Some say the
bigger picture looks fine. The economy is getting better, not
worse, but there's not much today to drive the market higher,""
said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB
Stockbrokers. He said indicators related to U.S. consumers would continue
to be a key factor and added: ""Some would say shares are looking
cheap. The bid for Cadbury proves that."" Most of the heavyweight banking sector was lower. Banco
Santander , UBS  and UniCredit  fell
between 1 and 1.9 percent. However, Commerzbank  was up 2.2 percent, after its
chief executive said it would be profitable by 2011, perhaps
sooner. [ID:nWEA0060]
  AUTOS RISE Automakers were among sectors on the rise, on a raft of
broker upgrades. BMW  rose 3.9 percent after Morgan
Stanley and RBS both upgraded their stance, and Credit Suisse
raised its price target. [ID:nL9692409] Renault  rose 3.5 percent after RBS raised its price
target.  Oil prices  hovered near $71 a barrel, ahead of an
OPEC meeting that is expected to keep output quotas unchanged. Repsol  and BG Group  were up 1.2 and 2
percent, respectively, after an oil and gas find at the Guara
oil field off the coast of Brazil. [ID:nL9685024] Japan's benchmark Nikkei  closed 0.8 percent lower on

by midday on Thursday as gains in pharmaceuticals and utilities
were outweighed by weakness in the beverage sector after Diageo
 lowered its profit target. By 1102 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 of top European shares was
down 0.3 percent at 971.02 points, after ending a four-day
winning run on Wednesday. The index is up 16.7 percent this year, and has surged more
than 50 percent from a lifetime trough set in March and analysts
are confident that further gains are in store. ""The trend of the last few weeks looks set to continue, if
not at the same pace,"" said Lars Kreckel, equity strategist at
Exane BNP Paribas. ""A lot of people are still under-invested in equities and

3.9 percent. GDF Suez led utilities higher, up 2.6 percent after, late on
Wednesday, the French power and gas group reported first-half
core earnings in line with expectations and confirmed financial
and cost-cutting targets. Banks were mostly higher, with Credit Agricole gaining 4.6
percent after France's biggest retail bank posted
better-than-expected second-quarter profit, helped by higher
earnings at its investment banking and asset management
divisions. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale and UBS
put on 0.7-1.9 percent. Natixis surged 16.9 percent after it was upgraded by brokers
following news in the previous session that state-backed bank
BPCE will provide a safety net of 35 billion euros ($50 billion)
of toxic assets at the bank. But Dexia, bailed out by several European governments last
year, shed 6.4 percent after saying late on Wednesday that its
restructuring was proceeding well as it posted its second
consecutive quarterly profit. HSBC and Barclays also fell.  MIXED SIGNALS However, while equities were steady, other signals pointed
to a return to concern about the state of the global economy.
 Japan's yen, which tends to gain at times of economic
adversity, strengthened to its highest level in more than a
month against the dollar and sterling while Japan's Nikkei fell
1.6 percent. Analysts said that investors fretted that a rally in risk
assets since March may have run ahead of a recovery in the
global economy and on worries about the outlook for Chinese
shares, which eased 0.7 percent. But in Europe the outlook seems to be brighter.  German consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in 15
months heading into September, the GfK market research group
said, as lower prices and a stable labour market left consumers
more willing to spend.  Investors will watch U.S. Q2 GDP data and jobless claims
due at 1230 GMT for further evidence that the global economy is
pulling out of recession. German drugmaker Bayer fell 2.9 percent, with traders
pointing to concerns that peer Boehringer Ingelheim may report
strong data about its rival drug to Bayer's anti blood-clotting
medication Xarelto.  But GlaxoSmithKline and Astrazeneca added 1.6 and 1.3
percent respectively. K+S meanwhile lost 3.5 percent as market participants
pointed to talk that the salts and fertiliser company may need
to increase capital, though the company declined to comment. In the auto sector, Volvo dropped 2.8 percent after the
world's second-biggest truckmaker said shipments fell 54 percent
year on year in July as the economic downturn weighed on demand
for commercial vehicles across the globe. Renault fell 2.1 percent. Among other individual movers, French hotel group Accor
surged 7.2 percent after saying it was considering splitting the
company in two autonomous units for its prepaid services and
hotels, as it reported a big drop in first-half pretax profit. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 were
down 0.2 and 0.1 percent respectively and Germany's DAX fell 0.7
percent.

choppy trading on Friday, with positive financial and energy
stocks outpacing weaker mining shares, which came under pressure
on concerns about global demand for metals. At 0839 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.2 percent at 946.66 points after hitting an
intraday low of 941.64. The index, which slumped 45 percent in
2008, is still up 13 percent this year and has jumped 46 percent
since a record low in March. Banks were among top gainers, with Standard Chartered, HSBC
, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and BNP Paribas rising 0.3-1.1
percent. ""We have had a rally of around 50 percent, so profit taking
is quite normal. But overall market sentiment is positive and
momentum is good. Just keep an eye on China,"" said Koen De Leus,
economist at KBC Securities. ""The most decisive thing now is the Chinese stock market.
And as long as the Chinese market holds up, the risky assets
will hold as well,"" he added. China has been a big worry for investors, registering large
losses that have seen the Shanghai Composite Index swing wildly
and even drop into bear market territory, 20 percent below its
recent peak. But the index gained 4.5 percent on Thursday for its second
largest gain this year and rose 1.7 percent on Friday. Energy shares were generally higher, with BP, Royal Dutch
Shell, Repsol, Total and StatoilHydro gaining 0.1-0.8 percent. But miners came under pressure after BHP Billiton, the
world's largest miner, said it did not expect to see ""clean
demand"" for the global metals sector until early 2010 as a
global slowdown bites. BHP Billiton fell 0.7 percent, while Antofagasta, Rio Tinto
 and Eurasian Natural Resources fell 0.1-0.5 percent. Automakers were also lower after the U.S. Transportation
Department said on Thursday the popular ""cash-for-clunkers""
programme that gives rebates for new car buyers trading in less
fuel-efficient vehicles will end on Monday. BMW, Peugeot, Renault and Fiat were down 0.1-1.1 percent. Investors ignored losses posted by the world's biggest
container shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk, sending its shares
about 5 percent higher. Maersk made a deeper-than-expected
first-half loss as freight rates, volumes and oil prices fell,
but its CEO did see some improvement in the world economy that
would work its way through to the company's results. Swiss drugs industry supplier Lonza fell 5.3 percent. It bid
$3.55 per share for Canadian rival Patheon, offering a potential
windfall to majority shareholder JLL, which bid just $2.00 per
share for the firm last December. In economic news, French private sector activity expanded
for the first time in 15 months in August, a survey of
purchasing managers showed on Friday, in a hopeful sign for
third-quarter economic growth. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and

in a tie-up with Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp, Chief
Executive Martin Winterkorn told a German magazine. ""Suzuki would be an interesting partner because of its
competency in small cars,"" he said in an interview with Manager
Magazin released ahead of publication on Friday. Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, was not immediately
available for comment, while Suzuki had no comment. A person familiar with the matter said there had already
been talks between VW and Suzuki. The magazine said, without citing sources, that Volkswagen
was interested in taking a 10 percent stake in Suzuki or forming
a joint venture. It said France's Renault was also in talks with
Suzuki. Renault was not immediately available. Suzuki CEO Osamu Suzuki had last told media in late June
that he had had no contact with VW, shooting down a Manager
Magazin report at the time that Europe's largest carmaker was
exploring a deal with its Japanese rival to boost its presence
in ultra small cars. Shares of Volkswagen were down 3.4 percent at 141 euros by
0934 GMT, while Renault was up 3.3 percent at 32.50 euros. The
DJ Stoxx European car sector index was up 1.5 percent. In the magazine interview, Winterkorn defended terms of VW's
deal to buy an initial minority stake in Porsche's sports car
business for up to 3.3 billion euros ($4.65 billion) as a step
toward a full merger of the carmakers. ""We are not giving away any money here,"" he said, adding
several investment banks and auditors had confirmed it was
paying a fair price in the deal. The transaction is set to make Porsche the 10th brand in
Volkswagen's camp, which ranges from small cars to heavy trucks. Winterkorn said he could imagine Porsche's annual vehicle
sales doubling to around 150,000 units ""in the foreseeable
future, say 2012 or 2013"" as it adds more models. These could include a new model smaller than the Boxster,
its smallest car so far; a ""little brother"" to the Cayenne sport
utility vehicle and an additional version of the new Panamera
four-door sedan, he said.

 By Atul Prakash LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - European equities ended lower on
Wednesday, with banks and autos leading the fall, as investors
scaled back their trading positions after heavy losses in Asia
and on concerns about the pace of the global economic recovery. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.3
percent lower at 931.98 points after trading in a range of
920.28-934.68.But the index is still up 44 percent since a
record low in March and has gained 12 percent this year. ""We are expected to experience a short period of
consolidation after such a significant surge in the market -- an
increase of about 20 percent in equity markets in three to four
weeks,"" said Romain Boscher, head of equity management at
Groupama Asset Management. ""We are convinced that in September, people will reallocate
money in favour of risky assets."" Financial stocks were among top decliners, with Standard
Chartered, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas
and Societe Generale down 0.5 to 2.2 percent. A survey by accountants KPMG found that Britain's banks are
likely to see their battered retail arms slide to a loss in the
second half of 2009, as the cost of bad loans, tough competition
and wholesale funding continues to weigh. UBS fell 1 percent on news the Swiss government will hand
over details of about 4,450 bank accounts to U.S. authorities as
part of a deal struck with Washington over UBS. Automakers were led lower by Volkswagen, which  slipped 14
percent after a German magazine said Qatar paid Porsche hardly
more than half the current market price for shares of Volkswagen
in a multi-billion euro deal announced last week. Both Porsche, which gained 3.7 percent, and VW declined to
comment. Qatar could not immediately be reached for comment. Daimler AG, Peugeot and Renault fell 0.8-2.1 percent.  CHINA FACTOR  The European stock market also came under pressure after the
Shanghai composite index slid 4 percent to a two-month closing
low on disappointment that authorities were not taking steps to
support the market amid heavy losses. It has fallen 20 percent
in two weeks, rattling global markets. ""The markets were looking overbought and in need of a
correction,"" said Mike Lenhoff, a strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""I do not think it is going to go very far. If anything the
supporting news flow is still very positive and interest rates
are going to remain where they are."" However, energy stocks ended in a positive territory,
tracking higher crude prices, which jumped 3.5 percent following
the American Petroleum Institute's report of a surprising draw
in crude oil inventories last week. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Tullow Oil, Repsol and
StatoilHydro added 0.2-1.3 percent. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation was up 6.2 percent.
It posted a sharp fall in first-half earnings but the drop was
smaller than expected and the miner predicted further recovery
in the second half.    Telekom Austria rose 5 percent after it
kept its outlook for this year's core earnings along with
second-quarter results in-line with analyst forecasts, defying
market expectations of a profit warning. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 percent,

* For up-to-the-minute market news, click on  By Dominic Lau LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday,
ending four weeks of gains, pressured by weak U.S. consumer
confidence data, which raised questions about the pace of
recovery in the world's largest economy. Financials were among the top losers on the pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 index, which closed 0.8 percent lower at 940.94
points after trading as high as 954.60 earlier in the day. It
lost 1 percent during the week. Among financials, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered,
ING, Credit Agricole and Deutsche Bank lost 0.9-4 percent. ""This is becoming more of the view that this rally is
looking to run out of steam anytime soon and no one wants to be
exposed on the upside,"" said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX
Capital in London. U.S. consumer confidence fell in early August as a growing
number of Americans fretted about their finances even though
they expected the broader economy to improve, the
Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said. Stronger second-quarter corporate earnings, partly aided by
lower market expectations, have helped the FTSEurofirst 300 to
maintain its rally since hitting a lifetime low in March. The
index has gained 46 percent since March, and is up 13 percent
for the year. ""To get further upside, companies need to deliver on the
earnings. They have to start seeing positive earnings growth
coming in, rather than less (earnings) downgrades,"" said Nick
Nelson, UBS's equity strategist. ""You also need to see positive
GDP growth in the third quarter as well."" Auto makers were another heavy loser on the pan-European
index, after Volkswagen plunged 15.6 percent on fears it was
overpaying for a stake in the sports car unit of Porsche, and on
its plan for an issue of preference stock. Porsche shares, however, jumped 8.7 percent. Within the sector, Renault, Peugeot, BMW and Daimler shed
1.2-5.2 percent. Volumes on the FTSEurofirst 300 were about 77 percent of its
90-day daily average volume.
Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 were down 0.8-1.7 percent. U.S. stocks were also
down sharply.  LUXURY LINING, HOT PROPERTIES Swatch Group, the world's largest watchmaker, surged nearly
13 percent after saying it expected demand to pick up in the
second half, while reporting first-half net profit that beat
forecasts. The results boosted the luxury goods sector, with Richemont
 and LVMH up 3.3 and 5.5 percent, respectively. Real estate shares were also in demand after a 3.9-percent
gain in British Land on a report that a group of Indian and Gulf
investors is mulling a 10-billion-pound-plus ($16.6 billion)
takeover of the property firm. The news lifted the property sector, with Hammerson, Liberty
International and Land Securities rising 0.7-1.7 percent. Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey said equity markets were
likely to fall after their sharp rally so far this year. ""Markets are now a little overbought and will probably have
a pullback,"" said Odey, founding partner at Odey Asset

reached an agreement in principle with General Motors over a
contract to buy a stake in GM's European unit Opel, Magna
Co-Chief Executive Siegfried Wolf told Reuters on Thursday. A deal with Magna would be a relief for German Chancellor
Angela Merkel, who is keen to avoid the prospect of mass layoffs
before a Sept. 27 election. She and the premiers of the four
German states that house Opel plants have publicly backed Magna,
arguing it offered a more sustainable plan for the group. Below is a summary of the main factories building Opel cars
in Europe:  * GERMANY: RUESSELSHEIM: About 15,600 employees assembled roughly
120,000 vehicles last year at Opel's headquarters. The factory
built the Vectra and Signum models as well as the new Insignia.
The site also houses a technical centre that carries out
research and development for the entire GM group. BOCHUM: A staff of some 5,200 produced close to 200,000
Astra compacts and Astra-based Zafira vans last year in
Germany's traditional coal-mining district, which has been
grappling with high unemployment for years. Under the original
Magna plan, some 2,200 jobs were at risk, according to German
politicians. EISENACH: About 1,800 workers assembled 156,972 3-door Corsa
subcompacts at the plant, which was inaugurated in 1992 as a
hallmark project to revive eastern Germany's decrepit industrial
structure. KAISERSLAUTERN: About 3,500 employees manufacture
four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines and components in a
plant situated in Rhineland-Palatinate. Close to 150,000 engines
were built there last year. Fiat SpA CEO Sergio Marchionne had
flip-flopped over the issue of its closure.  * BRITAIN: ELLESMERE PORT: The site assembled over 110,000 Astras in
2008 under the Vauxhall badge, the British version of the Opel
brand. LUTON: Last year built about 60,000 Vivaro delivery vans, a
larger sister to the Combo used for commercial purposes. The
site is also home to production of some 27,000 Renault Trafic
vans. Like Antwerp, a potential candidate for closure.  * OTHER FACTORIES IN EUROPE: BELGIUM - Antwerp: Some 133,000 Astras were built in the
Flemish plant, often considered to be one of the top candidates
for closure. POLAND - Gliwice: Built about 170,000 vehicles last year,
mainly Zafiras as well as Astras, making it a chief rival of
Bochum for production volume. SPAIN - Zaragoza: Built 423,000 vehicles last year,
consisting of 5-door Corsas, the Meriva minivan based on the
Corsa architecture, and the Combo delivery van.  Sources: Reuters;

Romanian industrial output decline slowed in June, data showed
on Friday, and analysts said there were signs of recovery driven
by improvement in Germany, a key market.
 Central and eastern Europe, which has become part of the
west European supply chain, has seen manufacturing output plunge
by double digits in the past months but latest data have shown
an economic turnaround may be coming. Romania's adjusted industrial output  was 0.2
percent down on the month, and fell by 8.9 percent on the year
in June [ID:nL7713832].  Analysts said Romanian industrial production has stabilised,
mainly due to car manufacturing focused on production of the
low-cost Dacia by Renault , which benefited from car
scrap schemes across Europe. ""Once the contraction in Germany and the euro zone
diminishes, figures will improve,"" ING Bank analyst Nicolaie
Alexandru-Chidesciuc said. ""Positive growth in euro zone is expected in the fourth
quarter so we can see positive rates for (Romanian) industrial
output in the last months of the year. But until then, we do not
rule out annual rates of -10, -14 percent,"" he added. Slovak output  fell by 19.6 percent on the year,
following a revised 24.4 percent decline in May [ID:nL7497381].
The market had expected a 19.3 percent fall. But the month-on-month, seasonally-adjusted basis showed 6.1
percent production growth. ""There was a significant improvement in (Slovak) industrial
output in June ... This suggests the industry could be
recovering,"" UniCredit Bank analyst David Derenik said. ""Industrial output will remain in negative territory in the
coming months, but its decline will slow and follow improvement
in Germany, which is Slovakia's key export partner,"" he said. Central and eastern Europe (CEEU) is heavily export-reliant
on the euro zone. Exports from Germany, key partner the CEEU
economies, surged in June, data showed on Friday, adding to
signs the EU's biggest economy is pulling out of recession
[ID:nL7727644]. Elsewhere in the region, Hungarian output data also showed an
improvement in June while Czech exports edged up from May,
confirming that the worst may be over. [ID:nL699067].

2009 on Monday, with banks rising as UBS appeared to have
avoided a fine in its tax dispute with the U.S. and after
results from HSBC and Barclays. At 0856 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 1.3 percent at 940.63 points, and had risen as
high as 940.84, the highest since November. The European benchmark index is up more than 45 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9, as second-quarter corporate results
have made investors a little more confident on recovery
prospects.
HSBC rose 5.5 percent after profits halved from a year ago
but were ahead of forecasts. Barclays rose 4 percent after it reported an 8 percent rise
in half-year profit, though bad debts at Britain's second
biggest bank almost doubled. ""The (Barclays) numbers this morning shows a continuing
steady hand at the helm from the same management team that took
the key decisions to see Barclays through the crisis,"" said Ed
Woolfitt, Head of Trading at Galvan Research, in a note. ""The numbers have also been delivered in a continuously
challenging environment, but are largely in line, with no great
surprises. "" UBS rose 4.1 percent on reports it may not have to pay a
fine as part a settlement of a dispute with the U.S. Government
on wealthy Americans suspected of using the Swiss bank to evade
taxes. UBS, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday,
rose 3.9 percent on Friday following initial news of the
settlement. BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale and UniCredit
rose between 2 and 2.5 percent.

a barrel, and also pushed up copper and other metals. BP, Royal Dutch Shell and StatoilHydro were up between 1 and
2 percent. Among miners, Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton,
 Rio Tinto and Xstrata rose between 2.2 and 4.7 percent. French car maker Renault roe 6 percent after HSBC upgraded
its rating to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" and raised its price
target to 40 euros from 12 euros. ""The outlook for H2 2009 looks strong, despite
weaker-than-expected H1 2009 earnings; a low base and fresh
model pipeline will lead to improvement in 2010,"" said HSBC
analysts in a note. Germany's Metro, the world's fourth-largest retailer, fell
2.3 percent after saying it expected retail sales to fall
further in coming months, though its second-quarter underlying
operating earnings were better than expected. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were up between 1.1 and 1.3 percent. Wall Street looked set to extend recent gains. Futures for
the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up between 0.8 and 1

 (Adds details, company comments) By Chang-Ran Kim, Asia autos correspondent TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp posted an
80 percent drop in quarterly operating profit hit by a stronger
yen and declining sales, and it kept its annual forecasts amid an
uncertain outlook for global vehicle demand. Suzuki, Japan's fourth-biggest automaker and known for its
penny-pinching expertise, made an operating profit of 6.86
billion yen ($72.4 million) in the April-June quarter, down from
a profit of 33.8 billion yen a year earlier. The result was better than a consensus estimate for a 2.9
billion yen profit in a survey of six analysts by Thomson
Reuters, as cost cuts added 52.3 billion yen to profit,
equivalent to three-quarters of its annual goal for cost-saving
contribution. Suzuki earned a net 2.14 billion yen in the first quarter,
down 92 percent from 26.0 billion yen a year earlier. Revenue
fell 37 percent to 577.1 billion yen as car sales declined 12.4
percent to 541,000 vehicles. ""(The first-quarter result was) better than anticipated,"" a
Suzuki spokesman said. But he added: ""There are many uncertainties facing the
industry. The sales environment is tough in Europe and the United
States, and our sales recovery is lagging in Japan. We need to
wait and see before we revise any projections."" For the financial year to the end of next March, the maker of
compact cars left its operating profit forecast at 10 billion yen
and its net forecast at 5 billion yen. The projections were based
on a cautious assumption for the dollar to average 90 yen and the
euro to average 115 yen during the year. Consensus forecasts from 17 analysts call for a much higher
operating profit of 41.3 billion yen. SUPPORT FROM INDIA Bigger Japanese rivals Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co
surprised markets last week with unexpected first-quarter
profits, which they attributed largely to deeper cost cuts rather
than anticipation of a recovery in demand. Suzuki has been able to offset some of the sales plunge in
developed markets with big growth in India, where it is the
top-selling brand through unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Suzuki's global car sales fell 12 percent to 541,000 units in
the first quarter, but sales in India grew about 10 percent to
197,000 units. That helped it outsell France's Renault SA in the first half
of 2009 to rank No.9 in global auto sales. Last month, Maruti Suzuki, in which Suzuki owns 54.2 percent,
unexpectedly reported a rise in April-June net profit driven by
brisk export demand for the new A-Star hatchback, higher selling
prices and lower raw materials costs. Earlier, rival compact-car maker Daihatsu Motor Co reported a
73 percent drop in April-June operating profit to 4.99 billion
yen and tripled its first-half profit forecast to 6 billion yen
citing slightly better-than-expected revenue and deeper cost
cuts. It kept its full-year forecasts intact. Shares in Suzuki have risen 95 percent in the year to date,
outperforming Tokyo's transport subindex, which is up 53 percent.
Daihatsu, a unit of Toyota Motor Corp, has gained 36 percent. Before the results were announced, Suzuki shares ended up 1.3
percent at 2,420 yen, while the transport sector gained 2.4
percent. Daihatsu ended down 0.5 percent at 1,060 yen after its
results.

percent fall in quarterly operating profit, hit by a stronger
yen and declining sales, but avoided the loss analysts had
expected by cutting costs aggressively. Predicting no convincing recovery in global car demand,
Japan's No.3 automaker kept its forecasts for an annual loss
unchanged as a lack of hybrid cars overshadowed solid sales in
China. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has previously said Nissan
will focus on returning to positive free cash flow through
joint cost-cutting efforts with French partner Renault SA. While some bright signs are emerging on the sales front --
Nissan has enjoyed stellar growth in China this year thanks to
a line-up heavy in smaller cars that enjoy tax incentives --
its lack of hybrid models has left it trailing the market in
Japan. For the first time, Nissan, Japan's No.3 automaker, sold
more vehicles in China than at home in the first half of the
year. Nissan made an operating profit of 11.6 billion yen ($122.9
million) in April-June, down from a profit of 80 billion yen a
year earlier but beating a consensus loss estimate of 117
billion yen in a poll of four analysts by Thomson Reuters. Nissan, held 44 percent by France's Renault SA, lost a net
16.5 billion yen in the first quarter, against a profit of 52.8
billion yen a year ago. Revenue fell 36 percent to 1.51 trillion yen. For the financial year to March 31, 2010, Nissan kept its
operating loss forecast at 100 billion yen and its net loss
forecast at 170 billion yen. Larger rival Honda Motor Co also surprised analysts by
posting a first-quarter profit on Wednesday, and raised its
annual profit forecast. ""We believe it would be premature to lift forecasts at this
juncture,"" Nissan Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga said,
listing among the risks a further rise in the yen and drops to
global car sales when government steps to stimulate demand come
to an end. Shiga said Nissan was on track to return to positive free
cash flow by the end of the financial year. As Honda and top ranked Toyota Motor Corp aim to spur car
sales with new hybrid vehicles, Nissan is pouring its efforts
into creating a market for pure electric vehicles with the
first launches in Japan and the United States next year. Partly on hopes for its lead in electric vehicles, shares
in Nissan have almost doubled in price this year, making them
the best performer among Japanese auto shares. Tokyo's
transport sub-index gained 44 percent in the same period. Before the results were announced, Nissan ended up 0.8
percent, while the transport sector gained 0.3 percent.

sales down over a fifth, and said it saw a recovery in the
European automobile market starting towards the end of 2010. PSA reiterated that it expected a recurring operating loss

first half of 2008. The group had a recurring operating loss of
826 million ""due to adverse market and industry conditions"" it

billion euros, a recurring operating loss of 720 million euros
and a net loss of 926.5 million euros on average. Four analysts

by France's Renault, denied on Tuesday it plans large-scale
layoffs after suppliers said the company told them it was
overstaffed by about 25 percent, or 27,000 workers. ""It is not realistic,"" said Avtovaz's president, Boris
Alyoshin. The company also denied huge job cut plans. ""No such figure
was announced. AvtoVAZ is currently not planning to lay off
workers,"" said spokesman Igor Krotov. AvtoVAZ held a meeting with regional officials of the Samara
Volga region, where its production facilities are located, and
suppliers on Tuesday. Two participants in the meeting told Reuters the company,
which faces dwindling demand for its clunky Lada models, said it
had a huge surplus of staff. One source, who was present at the meeting, said the company
was seeking to fire 27,691 people. Another source affirmed the
figure while adding the company was describing the staff surplus
rather than a plan for layoffs. AvtoVAZ has already decided this month to halt production
for a month during August, sending employees on holiday on
two-thirds of average pay. The reduced hours and factory stoppages come as Russian
companies seek to avoid more job cuts and potentially spark
social tensions after years of stability during the past decade
of economic boom. Russia's car sales are expected to halve this year as
consumers tighten belts because of job and salary cuts during
the country's first recession in a decade. The crisis and the
credit crunch have also made loans hard to come by, both for car
manufacturers and for would-be car buyers. A source at Tuesday's Samara meeting told Ria Novosti news
agency Avtovaz plans to cut 2009 car output to 293,000 vehicles
from 801,000 in 2008.

Plastic Omnium on Thursday said the financial troubles at
General Motors Corp, Chrysler and Saab Automobile had not
affected its interim earnings. Plastic Omnium, which supplies parts to automobile groups 
including Peugeot and Renault, had consolidated net profit of 8
million euros in the six months to end-June, compared with 2.5
million a year earlier. This was due to cost cuts, lower capital
expenditure and working capital. Shares in Plastic Omnium were up 6.57 percent at 1440 GMT,
against a CAC-40 index up 1.54 percent. Its net debt was 440 million euros by end-June with net
debt-to-equity of 99 percent. This compared with net debt of 560
million and debt-to-equity of 128 percent at end-December. Revenues for the second half were due to come in lower than
in the first half, Plastic Omnium said in a statement, with a
slowdown in its automobile division expected despite signs of an
upturn in production by car makers. ""We expect the third quarter to be above the first and
second quarters, and we see a significant drop in the fourth
quarter,"" said Chief Executive Laurent Burelle.  ""Today we think that we are at a low in terms of volume, and
we think this low will last 18 months, in other words the 
second half of 2009 and the whole of 2010."" Heavy turbulence in the car industry put pressure on
revenue, which fell by 19 percent in the first half to 1.18
billion euros, Plastic Omnium said in a statement. The production of passenger cars and trucks plummeted
globally by 25 to 50 percent in the first half, with European
customers either delaying or reducing their capital spending and
operating expenses, the firm added. Chrysler entered bankruptcy in April, while General Motors
filed for court protection on June 1. The new GM emerged from
bankruptcy 40 days later, as a leaner automaker pledging to win
back consumers and pay back U.S. taxpayers. At least 15 auto parts suppliers have filed for bankruptcy
or had their assets seized by creditors in 2009, according to

parts maker New Fabris came out of a meeting with officials on
Wednesday saying they may resume a threat to blow up their plant
to back demands for bigger redundancy payouts. Union representatives met Industry Minister Christian
Estrosi after workers agreed on Monday to remove gas canisters
they had placed at the New Fabris plant in Chatellerault in
central France, ready to blow it up. The 366 workers have been demanding a payment of 30,000
euros ($42,580) each from the two main clients of New Fabris,
Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen but are only in line to get
around 11,000 euros from the proceeds of the sale of assets to
the two carmakers. ""We knew very well we wouldn't get everything today,"" Eric
Poisson, a representative of the CFDT union said after the
meeting with Estrosi. ""If there is no progress, the canisters
will return,"" he said. The threat to blow up the plant was one of a spate of
similar protests by French workers following the ""bossnappings""
earlier in the year in which company executives were held
hostage in the workplace. Such spectacular protest actions have become the tactic of
choice for some workers but have been frowned upon by some
unions who regard them as counterproductive. ""These struggles for redundancy payouts...in no way solve
the underlying problems,"" the powerful CGT union said in a
statement. As well as staff at New Fabris, workers at telecoms
equipment maker Nortel and crane manufacturer JLG have made
similar threats. Renault and Peugeot have agreed to buy New Fabris' remaining
assets and stocks, subject to quality guarantees, on condition
that the money goes to the company's former workers. Estrosi also said in a statement that government measures
were in place that would help New Fabris staff find new jobs and
he repeated his condemnation of violent threats.

 (Adds Portugal incentives, Nissan export plans)  By John Bowker and Shrikesh Laxmidas  LONDON/LISBON, July 20 (Reuters) - Car manufacturer Nissan
said on Monday it will invest almost $700 million in two plants
to make batteries for electric cars in Britain and Portugal
after securing financial support from their governments. Automakers around the world are exploring plans for mass
electric car production as the industry seeks to haul itself out
a devastating downturn.  The Nissan news comes less than a week after Toyota said it
would produce its first European-built hybrid car in Britain
from 2010. A hybrid car is part-powered by electricity and is
more fuel efficient than traditional vehicles.  Nissan is the biggest car manufacturer in the UK by volume,
while Toyota is the fourth largest.  Nissan will invest more than 200 million pounds ($328.6
million) in the plant near Sunderland, north east England. ""The two governments (UK and Portugal) have offered to
extend financial assistance and other support to ensure that
Nissan locates the proposed plants within their respective
countries,"" Nissan said in a statement.  Nissan will also build a similar plant in Portugal as part
of its plan to make and sell environmentally friendly electric
cars. The location for the 250 million euro ($354 million)
plant, which should create 200 jobs, is yet to be chosen.  Each plant would produce 60,000 batteries a year. Nissan's investment in Britain will come over five years,
and will be supported by grants and loans from the UK taxpayer.  A Nissan spokeswoman said the details of grants had yet to
be finalised, but added that the firm was also in talks with
Britain over where to locate the production of electric cars.  An announcement is expected later this year.  UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the project would create
350 new jobs and safeguard hundreds more in the supply chain. ""Nissan's investment in a new battery plant ... here in
Sunderland is great news for the local economy,"" Brown said in a
separate statement, although Nissan axed around 1,200 jobs in
the area in January.  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates said during a
signing ceremony in Lisbon that Nissan's decision to build the
plant in Portugal ""will lead to other investments in electric
car projects in Portugal by other car manufacturers."" He said the government plans to boost electric car sales by
offering an incentive of up to 6,500 euros to buyers, making it
compulsory for new buildings to have charging points and
replacing 20 percent of cars in local government fleets with
electric ones by 2011. Last year the Portuguese government, Nissan and its French
partner Renault signed a deal to build 1,300 charging stations
for electric cars by the end of 2011. Nissan Europe Vice President Eric Nicolas said in Lisbon the
UK and Portugal plants will export batteries to Nissan factories
in other European countries and possibly also to other electric
car manufacturers. He said that if the electric car business goes well Nissan
may expand the two plants or build a new one in Europe.  Nissan plans to have battery production factories in the
United States, Europe and Asia.

managed to generate cash. Its sales of passenger car sales fell 13.7 percent, a slower
rate than the global market, it said. ""It's not a surprise, but it's good news,"" said a

sold for assembly in other markets -- fell 14 percent in the
first six months. European car sales rose 2.4 percent in June, but were down
11 percent over the first six months of the year, industry
association ACEA said earlier this week. It linked the June
increase to government cash incentives to drivers trading in old

shipped for assembly in other markets such as Iran -- sales were
down 17.5 percent at 1.386 million vehicles, PSA said in a
statement on Tuesday. The company gave no forecast, saying only that the second
half of the year would be shaped by the arrival of new car
models including the revamped Citroen C3 and Peugeot's 5008. The car industry has been hit by an unprecedented crisis,
with carmakers slashing production and cutting jobs late last
year in reaction to a slump in sales.  European car sales fell for the 13th straight month in May,
down 4.9 percent to 1.27 million vehicles. Governments have stepped in to help, providing loans and
introducing incentive schemes to help carmakers survive the
downturn, leading to some signs of improvement in recent months. The head of Citroen told Reuters he hoped car scrapping

encourage owners to replace older vehicles with newer models
would be extended.

Tuesday that its group vehicles sales fell 12.7 percent in June
but added it was seeing ""the first signs of a slight recovery on

Germany sales were up 40 percent in the month. But industry
watchers are concerned about how carmakers will cope with the

and Eurasian Natural Resources were down 3.4-9.2 percent. Rio Tinto fell 4.5 percent in line with the broader market.
The miner agreed to sell its Americas food packaging business
for $1.2 billion after last week raising $15.2 billion in one of
the world's largest-ever rights issues.  POOR ECONOMIC DATA  Recent macro-economic data also failed to cheer investors
and analysts said the market was cautious ahead of quarterly
results. ""There's a feeling corporate results are still going to be
poor,"" said Justin Urquhart-Stewart, investment director at
Seven Investment Management, in London. ""People are asking where the growth is going to come from.
They're looking at data and noticing it's still getting worse,""
though not at the same rate as before, he said. Data from the Sentix research group showed investor and
analyst sentiment in the euro zone worsened unexpectedly after
three months of improvement. Automakers also skidded on concerns about vehicle demand.
BMW, Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG, Peugeot, Renault, Fiat were down
2-3.9 percent. Porsche was down 3.2 percent. The automaker denied a
newspaper report which said five more potential bidders have
emerged for a Porsche-owned derivatives package which controls
around 20 percent of Volkswagen voting shares. But pharmaceuticals, generally seen as defensive, gained
ground. AstraZeneca, Sanofi-Aventis, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline
rose 0.6-1.2 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC-40 were down 1.5-1.9 percent.

1421,"Jul 03, 2009 07:08AM ET",UPDATE 2-China moves on Opel with BAIC bid,nan," * BAIC submits indicative bid - sources * Binding bid seen by mid-July * Winner faces tough EU cartel probe - German dep minister  * Opel task force head has doubts about Magna's concept  * UK govt. says may help fund any deal 
 (Adds BAIC bid report, detail on Vauxhall, background) By Angelika Gruber and Christiaan Hetzner FRANKFURT/MUNICH, July 3 (Reuters) - A Chinese automaker has
offered to buy a stake in General Motors unit Opel, challenging
a deal from Canadian auto parts supplier Magna, sources said on
Friday.  State-owned Beijing Automotive (BAIC) has submitted an
indicative, non-binding offer for Germany's Opel, sources
familiar with the situation told Reuters, and would make a
binding offer by mid-July. The news comes ahead of a Friday deadline for GM lawyers to
submit papers to U.S. federal bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber who
will rule by July 10 on a plan to create a ""new GM"" with brands
Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and truck unit GMC. Magna, backed by Russian partners, is the frontrunner to buy
Opel. Sources told Reuters on Thursday that Magna's board of
directors wants to approve a business plan for Opel on July 7. Belgian holding company RHJ International is the third
bidder, although it posted a sharply wider full-year loss on
Wednesday and analysts are doubtful it has the cash to compete
with its rival suitors. Whoever wins the race for Opel faces a tough antitrust
probe, a German government minister said on Friday. When asked whether he counted on Brussels examining any deal
for Opel under a lengthier, so-called 'phase II' investigation,
German Deputy Economics Minister Jochen Homann told reporters:
""Yes, clearly."" He declined to specify what issues might concern EU
competition authorities since the German government is still
awaiting a business plan for the takeover, which he hoped to get
by the end of July.Any business plans submitted will be evaluated by
PriceWaterhouse Coopers on behalf of Berlin, since the
government will have to offer more state aid after already
extending Opel a six-month 1.5 billion euro ($2.1 billion)
bridge loan that matures on Nov. 30. ""Every day that there is no restructuring costs money, every
month that goes by is a lost month,"" said Homann, the head of
the government's Opel task force. Some support may come from Britain, where GM produces and
markets Opel cars under the Vauxhall brand. The British government said on Friday it was prepared to
support any deal, possibly in the form of loans, if the terms
were right. ""I'm not going to discuss the detail of any financial
underwriting, but it may involve loans or loan guarantees,""
Business Secretary Peter Mandelson said. ""We would obviously
have to have interest paid and some security (for the loans).""  MAGNA DOUBTS Speaking at a Handelsblatt auto industry conference, Homann
expressed scepticism over Magna's concept for Opel and said that
vested interests praising the auto parts supplier's offer as the
best left the German government open to ""extortion"". ""We will see whether Magna's concept is successful. It is
based on theories over which one can heartily discuss...There
are justifiable question marks,"" he explained. He expressed doubts as to the wisdom of basing a business
plan on the boom-and-bust Russian car market and questioned
whether Magna could lure other carmakers to utilise Opel's
unused production capacity. Homann, who reports to Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg,
stated no preference for any of the three current bidders. Homann warned that whoever wants to acquire Opel would have
to prepare for a tough EU cartel probe.  ""The negotiating parties would be well advised to develop a
concept that is economically sustainable, fulfils our laws
governing loan guarantees and is compliant with EU subsidy
rules,"" he told the conference. Homann pointed to the chronic structural overcapacities that
the EU is concerned about and cautioned that the European
Commission has stated a bailout could not distort competition. Sources familiar with the Opel negotiations have voiced
anxiety that Paris might try to install French Economy Minister
Christine Lagarde as the next EU Competition Commissioner under
a likely second term for President Jose Manuel Barroso. They fear she might be more critical in part since Opel does
not have any major manufacturing operations in France, home to
key competitors PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, which counts
the French state as a large shareholder.

 (Adds going concern note) MOSCOW, July 2 (Reuters) - Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, part
owned by France-based Renault, said doubts were raised about its
future as a ""going concern"" in an audit of 2008 results, but it
would survive on government bailout funds. Auditors found that a 24.7 billion rouble ($792 million)
loss last year meant the company's liabilities exceeded assets
by 35 billion roubles as of end-2008, AvtoVAZ said on Thursday. AvtoVAZ's state-controlled shareholder has since granted a
25 billion rouble loan and other non-cash aid measures, such as
a subsidy on loans taken out to buy economy cars, AvtoVAZ said. ""While there remains uncertainty as to the group's ability
to achieve its short-term objectives ... management is confident
that those objectives will be achieved and the group continues
as a going concern and has no plans or need to discontinue or
significantly reduce activities,"" AvtoVAZ said in its 2008
report. Many Russian companies issue international-standard accounts
several months after the end of the reporting period. AvtoVAZ's short-term targets include improving demand,
reducing its operating costs, improving profitability, and
refinancing its debt. Russia's car market grew rapidly until October when the
global economic crisis started biting into consumer finance and
spending, which resulted in AvtoVAZ seeing an annual decline of
6 percent in number of cars sold.  Revenues ended the year up 2.4 percent but cost growth far
outstripped the pace of revenue growth, resulting in an
operating loss of 25.9 billion roubles.  AvtoVAZ shares were down 4.8 percent at 12.80 roubles by
1423 GMT, while the MICEX index was down 3 percent.

on Tuesday it expected to build more than 100,000 electric
vehicles a year when it starts U.S. production of the
zero-emission vehicles at its plant in Smyrna, Tennessee in two
to three years time. Nissan, Japan's No. 3 automaker, plans to begin selling its
first zero-emission cars in the United States and Japan in
2010, followed by a global roll-out in 2012 to take the lead in
a field that no mass-market maker has entered in big volumes. ""We have a different strategy from other manufacturers when
it comes to electric cars,"" Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of
Nissan and French partner Renault, told a news conference after
Nissan's annual shareholders' meeting. ""You have to go mass-market to get the cost benefit,"" he
said, adding that he expected assembly, along with the
production of batteries, in the United States to start in 2011
or 2012. Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co have
focused their fuel-saving technologies on gasoline-electric
hybrids, notably the Prius and the Insight, while General
Motors is aiming to launch its plug-in Chevy Volt in 2010. Nissan in December applied for U.S. government financing to
help it make electric vehicles and develop the advanced
batteries that power them. Ghosn said he expected a decision from the government on
the Energy Department loans soon, after various reports that an
announcement would be made later on Tuesday. Ghosn repeated that for the zero-emission cars to be
accepted widely, they would have to be affordable to consumers,
although that would depend largely on how generous the
incentives from governments are. ""Little by little we're seeing a lot of interest from
cities and government,"" he said. At the annual general meeting earlier, Ghosn told
shareholders -- many of whose questions focused on Nissan's EV
and hybrid strategy -- that Nissan had signed 27 initial
agreements with governments and agencies to help it roll out
electric cars. Nissan and Renault are each planning three electric vehicle
models for initial mass production.

1428,"Jun 19, 2009 06:32AM ET",AvtoVAZ says no plan to partner with Opel or Magna,nan," MOSCOW, June 19 (Reuters) - Russia's largest carmaker
AvtoVAZ is not considering any partnerships with Germany's Opel
or Canada's Magna, its president said on Friday, contradicting
remarks from the head of Sberbank. ""No one has made us any such offers,"" said AvtoVAZ chief
Boris Alyoshin. ""I don't know how this question can
hypothetically be discussed."" German Gref, the chairman of Sberbank, Russia's largest
lender, said on Thursday that AvtoVAZ, maker of the Lada, may
need to partner up with Opel in order to bridge the wide
technological gulf that has kept it from making a globally
competitive car.
 Sberbank, in partnership with Canadian auto parts group
Magna, reached a deal last month to buy a controlling stake in
Opel to save the German car maker from the bankruptcy of its
U.S. parent company, General Motors. A key motivation for taking part in the deal, which will
give Sberbank 35 percent of Opel, is to restructure the Russian
automotive industry using Opel's technology.Analysts have said that the restructuring would involve
pooling the Opel stake with Russian automotive assets, possibly
including AvtoVAZ and GAZ Group, to create a new
state-controlled industry champion.The comments from Sberbank's Gref were taken as confirmation
that AvtoVAZ could become part of this new holding.  However, Alyoshin said on Friday that AvtoVAZ already had
access to European technology through France's Renault, which
owns a 25 percent stake in the Russian firm. ""We already have a partner, an anti-crisis programme, a
memorandum with banks to finance our investment programme,""
Alyoshin said. ""There are no other offers."" However, Gref said on Thursday that an offer could be in the
works. AvtoVAZ ""either needs to go under Renault's management, or
look for another option -- for example, with Magna and Opel,""
Gref said. ""This has to get done in the next half year, and most likely
we will all come together and formulate a joint proposal.""

1429,"Jun 18, 2009 06:56AM ET",UPDATE 2-Sberbank moots Avtovaz link with Opel/Magna,nan," * Says Russia's top carmaker could join Opel deal * Says Russian car sector overhaul is goal of Opel deal * Says goal is for Opel to produce 3 million cars/year 
 (Adds German state premier background, details) MILAN/MOSCOW, June 18 (Reuters) - Russia's largest car maker
AvtoVAZ could be folded into an alliance with Opel and Canada's
Magna as part of a plan to double Opel's production in five
years, the head of Sberbank said. State-controlled Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, is
partnering with Canadian auto parts group Magna in a deal to buy
a majority stake in Opel. The deal, which has yet to be finalised, was a precondition
for the German government providing 1.5 billion euros in aid to
the German car maker, shielding it from the bankruptcy of its
U.S. parent company, General Motors. Sberbank chairman German Gref, whose bank would get 35
percent of Opel in the deal, said AvtoVAZ's technology was far
behind that of its peers and the firm needed to form an alliance
that would address this problem in the next six months. He said it could form such a partnership with Opel and
Magna, or with French automotive group Renault, which already
owns a 25 percent stake in AvtoVAZ. ""It either needs to go under Renault's management, or look
for another option -- for example, with Magna and Opel,"" Gref
told Russia's Channel One television. ""This has to get done in the next half year, and most
likely, we will all come together and formulate a joint
proposal,"" he said, referring to the Sberbank/Magna consortium
that acquired Opel. The preliminary deal between Magna and Opel parent GM,
struck last month in coordination with the U.S. and German
governments, included Russia's second-largest carmaker GAZ Group
 as an ""industrial partner"". This has been widely understood to mean that it will convert
at least some of its factories to produce Opel brand cars. Analysts have said that Sberbank will likely transfer its
Opel stake to Russian Technologies, the state-owned industrial
holding, which would then combine it with other automotive
assets into a new government-controlled giant. Russian Technologies already holds a 25 percent stake in
AvtoVAZ. It is unclear how AvtoVAZ would fit in and how much leeway
Sberbank would have to shift its stake. Roland Koch, the premier of the German state of Hesse where
Opel is based, said last week that Sberbank had free rein to
sell its stake to GAZ but that other Opel shareholders would
have to approve a sale to any other investor. A German industry source told Reuters on Thursday that a
number of longer-term scenarios could be envisioned, including
an alliance with AvtoVAZ. The German economy ministry, which has taken the lead in
coordinating the Opel rescue, had no immediate comment on Gref's
remarks. Gref said Russia's ultimate goal was to make Opel into a
conglomerate capable of producing up to 3 million cars per year. ""Today Opel makes about one and a half (million cars per
year). The aim is to bring that up to at least three million in
the next five years either through mergers and acquisitions or
through significant expansion of capacity,"" he said. Gref, whose bank has agreed with Magna to give Opel a 500
million euro ($697.8 million) cash injection, also repeated his
position that Sberbank will not hold on to the Opel shares for
long, and suggested his motivation in the deal was more
political than economic. ""This is a fairly difficult, risky and unprecedented
acquisition in Russia's history, one that for us is clearly not
related to making a profit,"" Gref said. ""It is related to the drive to restructure our automotive
sector, which is so weak and uncompetitive that I don't see any
way for it to stay in the game without forming these kinds of
alliances with the most modern firms,"" he said.

1430,"Jun 16, 2009 02:40AM ET",WRAPUP 1-Drop in European car sales slowed in May,nan," * Total European new car registrations down 4.9 pct -ACEA * W.European (EU15 + EFTA) figures show 3.2 pct drop -ACEA * Low-cost Dacia brand doubles May market share -ACEA * GM gets deal to sell Saab to Swedish carmaker Koenigsegg  By Christiaan Hetzner  FRANKFURT, June 16 (Reuters) - The decline in European car
sales slowed last month, although industry commentators said it
was still uncertain as to whether the worst was over for the
industry since the vicious sales slump began over a year ago. Industry data published on Tuesday showed new car
registrations falling just 4.9 percent to 1.27 million in May,
despite there being one fewer working day than a year ago. But while the decline was less severe a spokeswoman for the
ACEA industry association that collected the figures cautioned
that many car companies would have struggled to sell without the
benefit of gopvernments offering cash incentives to consumers to
scrap old cars in favour of new ones. ""It is very difficult to say where the market is at this
stage and it's probably too early to even say that it is too
early to say it has bottomed out,"" said ACEA's Sigrid de Vries. She added that May was the first month that benefitted from
a weak year-on-year comparison, since the slump first began in
May 2008 with a 7.8 percent decline in the European market. And the detail showed an even more variable picture with
sales at Saab and Chrysler suffering declines of over 60 percent
in May when both companies were operating under insolvency
protection schemes. However, Saab's owner GM announced on Tuesday that it had
reached a preliminary deal to sell Saab to Swedish sportscar
maker Koenigsegg. On Monday the head of Robert Bosch's U.S. car parts business
told Reuters Television that the worst might also be over for
the world's largest car market, which similarly plans a cash for
old cars programme. ""I think on the automotive side that we see the bottom now
and that we could expect that for the remainder of this year
that we see some slight improvement, but not a very significant
jump,"" Peter Marks said. But his boss, Bernd Bohr, who runs the Bosch group's
automotive division, remained gloomy for the business,
forecasting a 15-20 percent drop in global car output this year
that would directly be reflected in his top line. ""Despite the cash for clunkers incentive in Germany and some
other countries, our turnover with auto components will fall
more by 20 percent than by 15 percent,"" Bohr said.      Meanwhile French newspapers reported that tyre giant
Michelin would announce next week it will cut up to 1,500 jobs
in France. Frankfurt's VDA, the German automotive industry association,
said the overall Western European market would have declined by
22 percent were one to strip out results from Germany and France
where scrapping schemes have boosted new registrations. ""The global demand crisis in the auto industry is not over,
but there are initial indications that the downturn is
decelerating,"" it said in a statement.  Sales in Germany last month jumped by 40 percent on a year
ago to 384,578 vehicles thanks to its incentive scheme. But the
rise was distorted by a time lag in the registration of a lot of
cars which were actually sold in March under the scheme. ""First of all May 2008 was our worst on record and this May
was the best, but a large part of the swing also came from this
peak in demand at the end of March,"" a VDA spokesman said. The scheme has been such a hit in Germany, where the average
age of the country's fleet at over eight years qualified
virtually every car, that there is only enough money left to
accept applications for another 400,000 vehicles. Germany's idea has prompted other countries to introduce
similar programmes and schemes in the major markets of Spain and
the UK only began last month. ACEA's De Vries cautioned however against expecting similar
results there as in Germany, and not only because Germany
offered the most money. ""The success depends on the amount of money certainly but
also on the complexity of the scheme and it's clear that they
won't have the same effect in all countries,"" she said.  PREMIUM IN PAIN European car sales in May also showed a preference for
cheaper, more basic models, with drivers less attracted to
luxury brands like Daimler's Mercedes-Benz. The biggest increase in sales was enjoyed by Renault's
Romanian subsidiary Dacia's no-frills Logan saloon and Sandero
hatchback where buyers could extract the most savings. The low-cost Romanian producer saw its new car registrations
double in May despite Dacia's own domestic market shrinking by
half, giving the brand a 2 percent share in Europe last month --
equivalent to that of Japan's Nissan. Alone in the higher margin Western European market, Dacia
more than tripled its sales to nearly 20,000 vehicles. Meanwhile luxury and semi-premium brands experienced another
disastrous month by comparison. Mercedes and VW's Audi both fell by about 9 percent, while
BMW's eponymous flagship brand saw a 15 percent decrease and
Volvo dropped 20 percent. New car registrations at Toyota's Lexus plummeted by half
and continued to lose what little foothold it had in Europe
despite being a major luxury player in the United States. To see ACEA's full announcement, please click on:

industrial output slumped further in March, heralding a much
stronger than forecast economic downturn in the fastest growing
euro zone member of the past two years. Exports dropped 19.8 percent year-on-year while industrial
output was down 18.5 percent, the statistics office reported on
Friday. It said stocks of industrial products increased 6.3
percent year-on-year. ""These figures indicate that economic contraction this year
will be higher than forecast and will reach between 5 and 10
percent,"" said Saso Polanec of Ljubljana's Faculty of Economy. He said economic downturn would continue in 2010, although
contraction would be smaller than this year. The government expects Slovenia's economy to shrink 4
percent this year but grow one percent in 2010. The European
Commission said this week Slovenian economy will contract 3.4
percent in 2009 and expand 0.7 percent in 2010. Most analysts said there would be no growth in 2010. ""The economy will shrink 5 to 6 percent this year. There
will be some improvement in 2010 but GDP growth will still be
negative,"" economist Bogomir Kovac said. Slovenia exports 70 percent of its production, most of it to
to the European Union, and analysts said its economic fate was
closely linked to that of the bloc.  Slovenia's top exporters include Revoz, a subsidiary of
France's Renault , household appliances maker Gorenje
 and pharmaceutical producer Krka . Analysts said unemployment would also continue to rise this
year and next, as companies will have to cut workforces due to
lower demand for their products. Slovenia's jobless rate reached 8.2 percent in February
after touching a record low 6.3 percent in September. The
government expect unemployment rate to reach 8.9 percent by the
end of 2009 but analysts said that figure was conservative. ""Many companies are delaying layoffs but at some point
delays will no longer be possible and then we may face a sudden
big fall in employment,"" Polanec said. So far some 630 companies with over 63,000 employees asked
for state subsidies which the government has offered to firms
that chose to cut labour hours rather than reduce workforces. (Reporting by Marja Novak, Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic and

1432,"May 08, 2009 05:48AM ET","ANALYSIS-Spur from car,phone stockpile clearance seen muted",nan," * Global inventory index up after hits record low * Cars, phones, beauty product stockpiles shrinking * Firms say destocking mostly over * But little restocking seen as firms hold low inventories  By Eric Onstad and Helen Massy-Beresford LONDON/PARIS, May 8 (Reuters) - Stockpiles of cars, mobile
phones and beauty products that piled up during the global
downturn are being whittled away but restocking will do little
to boost growth as cautious firms adjust to lower inventories. Global inventory data this week and recent comments by
company officials show that a trend by firms to use up stocks
instead of churning out new orders is coming to an end.
 Low inventories could spark some growth as companies
cautiously begin to replenish stocks, but this will be muted
while sustained healthy demand is probably distant. ""It's too early to be talking about broad-based production
volume uplift because of restocking,"" said David Arnold, analyst
at Credit Suisse, referring to the hard-hit auto sector. In cosmetics, the pace of destocking was slowing in North
America and Europe, but this did not mean that sales were
expected to rebound, Chief Executive William Lauder of Estee
Lauder told a results briefing on Monday. ""We've probably we've got another 12 months to go,"" Lauder
said. ""Certainly right now I think what you're seeing is both the
consumer as well as retailer with whom we trade are adjusting to
a level."" Recent data has indicated that the worst of slashing
inventories to cope with weak growth is probably over. A world index complied by Markit Economics showed raw
material inventories at manufacturers ticked higher in April
after touching a record low the previous month. A ratio -- used as a leading indicator -- of stocks levels
to new orders is pointing to more rises in manufacturing output
after the output figure for April reached a seven-month high.  ""What we've been seeing recently at the global level and for
most of our national surveys is that this inventory ratio has
been improving,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit,
adding that the global ratio reached a 17-month high in April. ""We're still talking rates of contraction which have been
almost unprecedented, so we're still at a low point, but we
might be past the worst.""  DESTOCKING Heavyweights ranging from mobile phone giant Nokia to
confectionery group Cadbury have said recently that destocking
is over or will soon come to an end. ""We saw a lot of destocking happening in Q1... I think the
destocking impact has, in most markets, now reached the bottom,""
Nokia Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said. Cadbury reported last week underlying sales growth of 2
percent for its first-quarter, but this would have been 4
percent but for the effect of destocking. This occurred mainly in the United States and Canada and
three-quarters of the effect there was due to one distributor
cutting its stock levels to 17 days from 30 days to reduce its
working capital ahead of its own year-end on January 31. U.S. household product group Procter & Gamble Co said last
week that destocking was expected to continue in the second
quarter. ""It's the distributors that are under real cash and bank
line pressure... the easiest way for them to improve in the
short term is to pull down their inventories,"" Chief Executive
A.G. Lafley said.  LOWER AUTO INVENTORIES In the auto sector, firms made drastic production cuts late
last year to battle a costly build-up of stocks of vehicles. Daimler said on Thursday its inventory of unsold
Mercedes-Benz cars dropped to the lowest level for the month of
April in seven years. France's Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen both achieved their
year-end targets of cutting stocks of unsold vehicles to the
same levels they held at the end of 2007 and since then, they
have both gone further. Other sectors are also likely to adjust to lower inventory
levels so restocking effects are likely to be modest for now. ""The natural level of inventory holdings will more than
likely be reassessed and be lower than it was before,"" said
Dobson. ""We may not see a full inventory building process going
on until we actually start seeing output and new orders show
proper recovery or gains."" German firms still see their inventories as too high, so a
boost was not expected from stock building, an economist at a
think tank said on Wednesday.  Many firms are wary after they were forced to take huge
writedowns last year as the value of inventories fell. A report by Moody's Investors Service estimated that 20
companies with the largest inventories were forced to write down
10.6 billion euros ($14.21 billion) last year when the value of
those stocks slid. While more such writedowns could be seen this year, oil and
chemical firms might post inventory gains rather than losses as
prices recover, it added.

1433,"Apr 29, 2009 11:56AM ET",FACTBOX-Fiscal stimulus in G20 countries,nan," April 29 (Reuters) - Governments worldwide are rolling out
fiscal stimulus packages in the hope the public funds will boost
demand, limit job losses and prevent a deeper downturn. International Monetary Fund officials say that discretionary
fiscal stimulus so far amounts to around 2.0 percent of GDP for
2009 and 1.5 percent in 2010 at G20 level. The IMF published
updated estimates on April 26. http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/2009/042609.htm Russia tops the 2009 table with discretionary stimulus worth
4.1 percent of GDP, then comes China at 3.1 percent, South Korea
at 3.9 percent, Saudi Arabia at 3.3, China at 3.1, Japan at 2.4
Australia at 2.1 and the United States at 2.0 percent. The aggregate G20 stimulus figures are 0.2 percentage points
higher than estimates the IMF released in March, mainly because
of extra packages announced in Japan, South Korea and Russia. The IMF did not give revised impacts of the GDP impact in
its April 26 release but those of mid-March were as follows: -- aggregate G20 GDP gain from discretionary stimulus of
anywhere between 0.4 and 1.3 percentage points in 2009 and
0.1-0.2 percent in 2010 -- aggregate G20 GDP gain from total fiscal expansion (which
adds so-called automatic stabilisers to discretionary spending)
of 0.8-3.2 percentage points in 2010 and 0.1-0.9 in 2010. Below is a updated guide to fiscal stimulus programmes from
Reuters correspondents across the G20. Descriptions focus on
discretionary fiscal stimulus, or new public spending and tax
breaks aimed at boosting activity. In Europe, with a larger
welfare state, automatic stabilisers play a larger role
alongside discretionary spending.

1434,"Apr 27, 2009 11:34AM ET",ANALYSIS-Turkey auto sector growth seen plunging in 2009,nan," * Sharp contraction in Turkish auto sector seen in H2 2009 * Turkey auto sector sales seen down 20-30 percent in 2009 * Further government stimulus seen unlikely * Domestic, export auto markets seen up 10-15 percent 2010  By Daren Butler ISTANBUL, April 27 (Reuters) - Turkey's automotive sector
faces renewed sharp contraction in the second half of 2009 and a
slow recovery beyond that as the government looks unlikely to
continue its so far rewarding stimulus package. Tax cuts have already provided a short-term boost to the
industry, but an extension of these is remote as Turkey deals
with the global financial crisis that has ravaged the industry
worldwide and hit that nation's economy. Now analysts are predicting a domestic auto sector
contraction of 20-30 percent in 2009, to about $9 billion in
size, with exports falling 25 percent to about $18 billion. Domestic growth in 2010 is seen at just 10-15 percent, while
exports were seen rising 10 percent. Turkey's auto industry has been a key pillar of the nation's
post-2001 boom, attracting foreign producers, leading a surge in
exports to European markets and raising hopes it could become a
regional automotive production hub. That buoyant trend collapsed in the first quarter, vehicle
output tumbling 59 percent on the year and inspiring Ankara to
cut the special consumption tax on vehicles of under 1,600cc to
18 percent, from 37 percent, for the three months to mid June. As a result, automotive production in March rose 31 percent
from a month earlier with the capacity utilisation ratio rising
to 47 percent, from 37 percent. The tax breaks have boosted automotive shares -- Tofas by a
third. Industry representatives are also calling for an
incentive to scrap old vehicles. However, sources in Ankara are tight lipped about the future
of the auto industry tax incentives after mid June, when they
expire, having already introduced a raft of other tax cuts to
boost broader economic activity. ""I think the government will wait to see what happens after
the tax reduction expires,"" EFG Istanbul analyst Alper Paksoy
told Reuters, in line with other analysts' views.  CALLS FOR MORE INCENTIVES TEB Investment analyst Didem Ozatalar said the failure of
the government to provide further incentives, may prompt a
temporary sell-off in the shares, which have shown signs of life
after plunging last year. Oyak Securities analyst Cemal Demirtas said the main risk to
the March growth was ""a sudden return to the old tax rates"".  Both Demirtas and Paksoy say the best way of sustaining the
upward turn in sales would be to extend the tax cuts until
year's end. Phasing in a tax rate lower than the original levels
was another option, Demirtas said. Tofas, a venture of Fiat and Turkey's Koc Holding, has
surged 70 percent from mid-March to as high as 2.15 lira last
week. It has since fallen to 1.97 because of the uncertainty
over its second-half prospects. Shares in Koc-Ford venture Ford Otosan rose a third to 5.1
lira over the same period. Toyota and Renault are also involved
in local production. ""My top picks have performed very well in the last couple of
months. I still like Tofas and see more way to go for the shares
as it is set to launch new versions,"" said Didem Ozatalar,
analyst at TEB Investment. Analysts and industry representatives also called on the
government for scrap incentives, to trade-in old cars for new
models, to kick-start the industry's domestic growth potential. The level of car ownership in Turkey is less than 100 per
thousand people, against 600 in western Europe. ""There is a
fast-growing domestic market as well once you look beyond the
crisis,"" Credit Suisse analyst Stuart Pearson said. The rejuvenation of the sector will depend heavily on
developments in key European export markets, but the tentative
shoots of recovery are expected to re-emerge at year's end. ""Over the longer term ... we see annual (automotive market)
growth of 5-10 percent over the next five years,"" Demirtas said.

1435,"Mar 19, 2009 09:48AM ET",FACTBOX-Global crisis brings threat of protectionism,nan," March 19 (Reuters) - The world economic crisis has
encouraged many countries to take steps to support their
economies or individual industries, despite fears that
protectionism could deepen recession. Here are some of the measures taken by countries to bolster
domestic industries that have been criticised as protectionist:  UNITED STATES - A $787 billion U.S. stimulus package, signed
by President Barack Obama last month, was criticised for its
""Buy American"" clause that says firms must use U.S. steel and
other U.S.-made goods.  -- The bill provided for a 25 percent competitive margin for
US iron and steel for all expenditures under the bill. Several
governments, including Canada and the EU objected to the
provisions. A final provision also includes language that
requires the U.S. to implement the provision consistent with its
trade commitments.  -- A $17.4 billion lifeline to two Detroit carmakers was
announced on Dec. 19.  -- On Feb. 17, GM and Chrysler requested a further $22
billion in U.S. government loans as they submitted plans with
the government on how they could restructure.  ARGENTINA -- Imposed licensing requirements on products such
as auto parts, textiles, TVs, toys, shoes, and leather goods.  BRITAIN - Energy workers staged protests in across Britain
in a row over the use of imported labour from other EU
countries, saying that they were undercutting British pay rates. -- The EU's internal markets commissioner has said some
European countries were ""very upset"" about sterling's recent
losses, which makes British exports more competitive on price.  -- Britain announced in January it would guarantee up to 2.3
billion pounds ($3.29 billion) of loans to the car industry   CHINA -- Frequent target of complaints that it blocks access
to its markets or gives unfair help to exporters, including by
keeping its yuan currency weak. The last meeting of G7 finance
ministers in Rome praised Beijing for allowing some appreciation
of the yuan but maintained calls for the process to continue. -- China has put in place an import ban on Irish pork, as
well as a rejection of some Belgian chocolate, Italian brandy,
British sauce, Dutch eggs and Spanish dairy products. -- China on Wednesday rejected a $2.4 billion bid by
Coca-Cola  for China's top juice maker, Huiyuan Juice
<1886.HK>, blocking what would have been the largest-ever
takeover of a Chinese company by a foreign rival. The Ministry
of Commerce made the ruling on grounds that the merger would
have been bad for competition. However, the ruling has fanned
concerns that economic nationalism is on the rise in China. -- European lobby group BusinessEurope cites changes to VAT
rebate system to promote exports and restriction of raw material
exports as areas of concern.  ECUADOR -- Raised tariffs on 940 products including butter,
turkey, crackers, caramels, blenders, cell phones, eyeglasses,
sailboats, building materials and transport equipment.
 EUROPEAN UNION - Imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese
screws, fasteners, candles and steel wire products. -- Reinstated export subsidies on dairy produce. -- Imposed steep anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on
imports of biodiesel from the United States.  FRANCE -- Pledged loans of 6 billion euros ($7.6 billion) to
struggling car makers PSA Peugeot Citroen  and Renault
 (3 billion euros each) in return for what has been
characterised as an unwritten pledge not to close facilities in
France. The European Commission has said it is satisfied the
guarantees do not amount to protectionism.   INDIA -- Raised tariffs on some imported steel products.
Banned imports of Chinese toys for six months, saying it was in
the interest of public safety.  -- Also increased rebates under the duty drawback system for
exporters.  INDONESIA -- Plans to order its nearly four million civil
servants to use local products ranging from footwear to heavy
machinery. Officials denied the measures would be protectionist.
Limited the number of ports and airports serving as entry points
for certain imports, such as electronics, garments, toys,
footwear, and food and beverages.  ITALY -- Unveiled a $1.7 billion package for its car
industry. Carmakers in turn have been told to maintain their
plants in Italy and pay auto parts suppliers.  MALAYSIA -- In January Malaysia banned the hiring of foreign
workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect
its citizens from mass unemployment.  MEXICO -- Angered by Washington's move to block Mexican
trucks from using U.S. highways, Mexico said on Monday it would
raise tariffs on 90 American agricultural and manufactured
products, about $2.4 billion worth of exports from 40 U.S.
states.  RUSSIA --  Raised duties on imports of used cars to prop up
its struggling domestic industry.  -- Set a new seasonal import tariff on rice of 160 euros
($202.4) per tonne from Feb. 15 to May 15, 2009 to protect
domestic producers.   SPAIN -- Approved a 4 billion euro ($5.17 billion) package
to support its ailing car industry. The support would depend
upon carmakers' ability to guarantee jobs and would not grant
aid to any company that has laid off workers permanently without
first reaching agreements with unions.  Sources: Reuters; tradeobservatory.org; BusinessEurope;

 (Adds company details) ISTANBUL, March 11 (Reuters) - Automotive output in Turkey
was down 63 percent year-on-year in January and February while
exports fell 62 percent as the credit crisis bit deep, the
Automotive Industry Association (OSD) said on Wednesday. Turkey's largest export market, the European Union, is in
recession, while consumer confidence and demand at home are
shrinking. The biggest percentage fall in exports was shown by Ford
Otosan, a joint venture of local conglomerate Koc Holding and
Ford Motor Co. Its exports fell 75
percent to 12,038 vehicles in the January-February period. Exports by Tofas, a joint venture between Koc and Italy's
Fiat, dropped 54 percent to 18,910, while those of Oyak Renault
fell 50 percent to 23,555. OSD said last month it expected 2009 exports and production
to fall 25 percent and domestic auto sales to shrink 20 percent. The OSD predicted the auto market would not start recovering
until the fourth quarter of 2009 under the most optimistic
assumption.

1437,"Mar 11, 2009 08:24AM ET",UPDATE 2-Russian car sales collapse deepens-AEB,nan," * New car sales down 38 percent in February year-on-year * Decline to continue in coming months * 40-50 percent drop seen for full year * GM, Renault, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota among worst hit 
 (Adds analyst comment, details, background) By Simon Shuster and Olga Borodina MOSCOW, March 11 (Reuters) - A collapse in the Russia car market deepened
last month with sales down 38 percent year-on-year after a 33 percent fall in
January and the downward spiral was set to continue, data showed. Sales of the 10 best-selling brands slumped 11-49 percent in February with
global auto majors GM, Hyundai and Toyota among the biggest losers. ""Because of the increased customs tariffs, high loan interest rates and the
rouble devaluation we can expect a further price increase and decline of the
automotive market in Russia in the coming months,"" said Martin Jahn, vice
chairman of the Association of European Businesses (AEB) which compiles monthly
statistics on the Russian car market. For the full year, 40-50 percent fewer cars will be sold than in 2008, said
Ivan Bonchev, automotive analyst at Ernst & Young in Moscow. ""Earlier we believed 2009 would see a decline of 20-30 percent, but clearly
things are not getting any better,"" Bonchev said. ""It is hard to predict when
the market will hit bottom, but I think this year will be the hardest."" Economists use car sales as an indicator of whether consumers are confident
enough in the economy's future to spend money now rather than squirrel it away. Vehicle sales in Russia, which was set to become Europe's largest car market
in 2009, began to contract sharply late last year when the price of consumer
credit soared due to the global banking crisis. In the same period, the value of the rouble fell by about a third to the
dollar, putting the cost of imported vehicles out of reach even for relatively
well-off Russians. Then, in an effort to protect local car makers such as AvtoVAZ, the
government imposed an import tariff on new automobiles in January, lifting the
price of some imported models by as much as 25 percent. These factors have yet to felt in full, said Bonchev, because there was a
stockpile of cars imported before the tariff was enforced. In the coming months,
these stockpiles are set to dry up, raising the price of imported foreign models
dramatically. ""March could be even worse, because the new prices will already be in
place,"" he said. Carmakers who produce or assemble vehicles in Russia, such as
Ford and Hyundai, could then begin to feel a competitive advantage over peers
that import cars, he added. A small reprieve for the market could come from a state initiative to
subsidise car loans. Last month, it vowed to earmark $55 million of this year's
federal budget to compensate banks for charging lower rates on the loans to
consumers. ""But the amount is of course very small. It won't provide much momentum,""
Bonchev said. Following are February sales for the top-10 car brands in Russia compared

1438,"Mar 02, 2009 05:16AM ET",ANALYSIS-Fallen angels set to throng Europe's credit markets,nan," * Investors now focus on potential fallen angels * Automakers, retail, building materials seen as candidates * Big jump in spreads follow rating downgrades  By Jane Merriman LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The economic downturn will drive
more European corporate bonds into the ranks of ""fallen angels"",
an opportunity for investors as they try to guess whose will be
downgraded next after Renault and Fiat. Companies become fallen angels when they lose their
investment grade rating to become speculative grade or junk.
Although spreads often widen in anticipation of a rating
downgrade, the fall to junk status itself usually triggers a
further sharp move. ""We have numerous credits now on the verge of fallen angel
status that have not yet fallen,"" said Peter Aspbury, head of
high yield research at European Credit Management. ""Give it another quarter or so, and you will have even more
of the (European) auto sector below investment grade, plus
further downgrades in basic materials and retail for example,""
he said. ""There will be better pickings for fallen angel
investors at that point."" A move to junk drives down the price of a company's bonds
and raises its borrowing costs, because it is seen as more risky
in terms of a potential default. Investors can bet that a potential fallen angel avoids the
drop, by simply buying its low-priced bonds. They can also make
money on those that do, by using credit default swaps (CDS) to
buy protection against the company's default -- a contract that
rises in value as spreads widen. The economic downturn has turned 75 companies globally into
potential fallen angels, the highest number in 18 years,
according to Standard & Poor's. S&P defines potential fallen
angels as companies rated BBB- with a negative outlook. This compares with a monthly average of 47 potential fallen
angels in 2008, S&P said. Barclays Capital estimates that European companies with
about 55 billion euros of bonds outstanding could be potential
fallen-angel candidates because of the global economic downturn. ""We expect that 41 billion euros ($52.1 billion) worth of
bonds are likely to go junk, while 14.7 billion are possible but
not likely,"" Barclays said in a note. Europe's high-yield market, where junk bonds are traded, is
small compared to that of the United States and has had only one
new issue -- by German healthcare group Fresenius -- since the
start of the credit crisis in July 2007. ""The big source of growth in the high-yield market will be
the new supply through fallen angels,"" said Mahesh Bhimalingam,
a Barclays high-yield credit strategist.  DOWNGRADE SIGNALS Some European retailers, including Kingfisher, Marks and
Spencer and PPR are already trading in the credit derivatives
markets at levels that signal a downgrade. Five-year credit default swaps on French retailer PPR were
at about 557 basis points on Monday, a level analysts see as
already pricing in a downgrade. PPR is rated BBB- by Standard &
Poor's. ""The UK retail sector is expected to face particularly
challenging trading conditions in the months ahead,""
CreditSights said in a research note. ""Cross-over concerns
center on Kingfisher and Marks and Spencer."" When downgrades occur, spreads can widen more sharply, even
though the market had anticipated it. This is partly because many investors are restricted by
investment mandates to hold only investment-grade assets, and so
are forced to sell after a downgrade. ""Even if they (the markets) are pricing in a downgrade, the
chances are it's not enough,"" said Ben Bennett, credit
strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. Five-year CDS for Renault, for example, were trading at
around 440 basis points on Feb. 20 before it was downgraded by
Moody's Investors Service to Ba1, one level below investment
grade. They have since jumped wider to around 568 basis points. The spread on Renault's bond maturing in 2010 almost doubled
to 472 basis points from 250 basis points. ""This underlines the need for state aid to provide
junk-rated companies with access to capital,"" said Frank
Hussing, credit analyst at Commerzbank in a note. An investor can profit from the widening spread by buying
protection in the credit default swaps market. Or investors can
try to pick companies that come close to a downgrade but then
take steps to avoid it. ""From an active fund manager point of view, the aim is to
try to pick those who perhaps will avoid the drop to fallen
angel -- by doing a rights issue,"" said Bennett. Last month, French building materials company Lafarge tapped
shareholders for an additional 1.5 billion euros to bolster its
finances and strengthen its credit ratings. Standard & Poor's
revised its outlook on Lafarge's BBB- rating to stable from
negative following the issue. Investors are more likely to shun the debt of high-risk
fallen angels in the current uncertain economic environment,
while record volumes of new issues in the euro bond market so
far this year give them plenty to choose from. ""Yields on primary investment grade bond issuance are so
attractive and tend to be more liquid that it makes secondary
fallen angel paper less appealing,"" said Aspbury.

U.S. aid to the car sector to be checked to see if it fits World
Trade Organisation rules, President Nicolas Sarkozy said on
Thursday, escalating tensions over rival industrial policies. Sarkozy, who has announced aid for French automakers that 
critics have called protectionist, also said he would ask for a
coordinated European plan to help the car industry. U.S. officials are this week meeting car company executives
to discuss the industry's requests for billions of dollars in
extra aid to help it through the financial crisis. ""We need to see if the U.S. aid is compatible with the WTO,""
Sarkozy said at a roundtable discussion in eastern France on the
car industry, a sector which accounts for one in 10 French jobs. He said Europe must show itself to be ""less naive"" and added
that within Europe, officials should pay less attention to
checking whether car plans meet EU rules. Leaders of the European Union will meet in Brussels on
Sunday to discuss coordinating responses to the financial crisis
and Sarkozy said he would ask for an EU-wide car plan. ""I hope the Commission will react and understand that there
are other things to do than working out whether state aid fits
competition rules,"" he said. Earlier this month Sarkozy faced criticism from his EU
allies for a 6 billion euro ($7.64 billion) state loan offered
to Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen in return for an unwritten
pledge not to close production sites in France. In the United States, the head of Chrysler LLC, which is
seeking up to $5 billion in new aid on top of $4 billion of
loans in December, met officials on Wednesday.  Ford executives met officials earlier this week and General
Motors Corp bosses will meet them on Thursday.   DOUBLE STANDARDS The EU's transport chief said on Thursday it would consider
appealing to the WTO if U.S. aid made conditions unfair for
European manufacturers, but he warned against double standards
inside and outside the bloc. ""Europe is evaluating -- if that help should impinge on the
competitiveness of our producers -- appealing to the WTO,""
European Transport Commissioner Antonio Tajani said in an
interview with Italian paper La Stampa. The EU car industry, which employs 2.3 million people
directly and 10 million in related industries, has warned that
output could fall by at least 15 percent this year and producers
might need up to 15 billion euros in financial help. EU competition authorities are scrutinising car industry
support in France, Spain, Britain, Italy, Germany and Sweden. ""If we defend ourselves from this outside the EU, we can't
permit it internally,"" said Tajani. Leaders of the G20 developed and emerging countries agreed
last year to fight protectionist tendencies which have arisen as
countries try to defend their national interests during the
financial crisis. WTO chief Pascal Lamy on Wednesday urged G20 leaders not to
backtrack on their commitment.

1440,"Feb 13, 2009 10:40AM ET",UPDATE 2-Spain approves 4 bln euro car industry aid,nan," (Adds government comment, context) MADRID, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Spain's government on Friday
approved a 4 billion euro ($5.17 billion) package to support its
ailing car industry and protect jobs after a string of layoffs
and stoppages at vehicle plants. Spain said the support package was the second largest in
Europe, in terms of total funding, ahead of a 2 billion euro
programme in Germany and 3 billion euros in investment by the
British government. Most of the measures approved on Friday had been previously
announced as part of Spain's 70 billion euro economic stimulus
plan. France this week offered a 6 billion euro state loan for
Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen and ran into criticism from EU
allies who said the move amounted to protectionism. Spanish Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian said Spain had to
protect its car sector, which is almost entirely foreign owned. He said the government support would depend upon carmakers'
ability to guarantee jobs within the industry and would not
grant aid to any company that has laid off workers permanently
without first reaching agreements with unions. Many job losses within the industry in Spain have been after
agreements between union representatives and company heads under
the condition workers are re-employed within an agreed time
frame. Renault has announced temporary lay-offs for about 10,000
workers at its four factories in Spain and cut 400 temporary
workers at its factory in Palencia, while newspaper La
Vanguardia said Seat would suspend 5,300 workers' contracts. ""The auto sector employs 300,000 people, it drives 6 percent
of GDP, and we are talking about a sector that provides around
20 percent of exports,"" Sebastian said at a news conference
following the government's weekly cabinet meeting. Under the Spanish plan, the government will channel 1.2
billion euros in state credit to boost car purchases during 2009
and 2010. Spain will also earmark 800 million euros to help car and
vehicle part makers upgrade plants and boost value-added
production. A further 950 million euros will go towards improving rail,
road and sea distribution systems and 320 million euros towards
research projects, over 2 years. The government will give 100
million in tax breaks on research spending by firms. The remainder of the 4 billion euro package is made up of
state credit lines to small and medium sized firms in the
vehicle sector. Spain has been hit harder than neighbours by the global
economic crisis as the collapse of its decade-long house
building boom coincided with the credit crunch. Spanish car sales fell 28 percent to 1.16 million in 2008,
the largest-ever yearly decline, and could fall to 900,000 in
2009, according to industry group ANFAC. Sales have fallen amid credit restrictions and a rise in
unemployment to the highest level in the European Union at 14.4
percent in December. (Reporting by Andrew Hay; editing by Ben Harding)


"
1441,"Feb 13, 2009 08:08AM ET",ANALYSIS-Protectionist Sarkozy becomes EU villain,nan," By Crispian Balmer PARIS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
has gone from hero to villain in the European Union within just
six weeks, the plaudits for his deft leadership of the 27-nation
bloc giving way to vilification over his protectionist urges. The row over French efforts to ringfence its car industry at
the expense of its eastern allies has eroded Sarkozy's
international standing and revived accusations that Paris is
wedded to state interventionism. ""Sarkozy had emerged as the pre-eminent European leader,
head and shoulders above other contenders, but now I think he
has largely blown it,"" said Charles Grant, director for the
Centre for European Reform in London. France appeared to be the most dynamic force in Europe at
the end of last year, following its successful handling of the
EU presidency, during which time Sarkozy led from the front to
secure a united response to the financial crisis. But any idea of unity was thrown out the window last week
when he said it was unjustified for French car firms to set up
plants in places like the Czech Republic. Putting actions to words, Sarkozy later handed local car
producers PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault cheap loans in return
for promising not to close their French factories. ""As someone who has followed the European Union for 20
years, I cannot think of any single more damaging comment than
what Sarkozy said in that television interview,"" said Grant. However, to anyone who has followed Sarkozy's political
career, such opinions would not have come as a surprise,
especially in the current context of economic downturn,
gathering social unrest and plunging opinion polls.  COLBERT REVISITED Since the start of the economic crisis, Sarkozy has
denounced the ""dictatorship of the market"", vowed to end
""laissez-faire capitalism"" and created a fund to protect French
business from falling into the hands of foreign predators. Going further back in time, when he was finance minister in
2004, Sarkozy prevented local engineering group Alstom from
going bankrupt by pumping in state cash, defying the perceived
wisdom that the market should have decided its fate. To go from believing in an activist state to promoting
protectionist policies is a short step in the country which gave
the world Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's finance minister
who pioneered state control of the economy. But when it comes to defending car factories, Sarkozy is
being driven more by pragmatism than ideology. Up to 2.5 million people took to the streets of France last
month to protest against Sarkozy's economic policies and unions
have called a new day of action for March unless he bows to
their demands for concerted action to help consumer spending. Such protest movements have a habit of spiralling out of
control here, and when Sarkozy went on television last week he
was speaking exclusively to a domestic audience trying to
convince them he could stem the recent flood of job losses. His message did not get through and his popularity rating
subsequently plunged, hitting a record low of 36 points in one
IPSOS poll, down nine points on the month. Analysts said that if anything, Sarkozy did not strike
enough of a populist tone to calm his anxious audience. ""The French almost wanted to hear a more demagogic
president,"" said Jean-Francois Doridot, head of IPSOS. ""He cannot stay motionless. He has to be seen to act. If
people think he is not doing anything, he won't stand a chance.""  EVERYONE AT IT The French centre-right government strongly denies that it
is pursuing a protectionist agenda and says that in any case,
other countries are reacting in exactly the same way as the bloc
tumbles into recession. Before France moved to help its auto sector, Italy had
offered support to its own carmakers in return for guarantees
that they keep their Italian plants running. Numerous western governments have also told their ailing
banks that they expect them to support businesses back home in
return for bailout packages. Such policies suggest that the most severe economic crisis
in the history of the European Union is not just battering its
open market ethos in France, but across the alliance. ""What Sarkozy said wasn't wise, but in the wider context
everyone is engaged in a dismantling the European Union,"" said
Ulrike Guerot, head of the Berlin office of the European Council
on Foreign Relations. ""But if you have a frontrunner like France which is now
dysfunctional, you will find many countries will hide behind it
and do likewise,"" she added.

1442,"Feb 13, 2009 04:40AM ET","UPDATE 1-French economy shrinks, companies cut jobs",nan," (Adds details, analyst comment) By Anna Willard PARIS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - France's economy contracted at the
fastest pace in 34 years in the fourth quarter, sending the
budget deficit to a record and setting the economy up for a poor
2009 as companies slashed jobs. Gross domestic product contracted 1.2 percent in the fourth
quarter, data from national statistics office INSEE showed on
Friday, slightly worse than expectations of a fall of 1.1
percent following a 0.1 percent rise in the third quarter. The economy grew just 0.7 percent last year, the weakest
rate since 1993. ""The first quarter will be difficult,"" Economy
Minister Christine Lagarde told RTL radio. ""We will have a
difficult year."" The data tallies with other depressing reports from around
Europe. Germany registered its worst quarterly GDP contraction
since 1990 and Spain posted its largest quarterly fall in 15
years, pushing it into recession. A separate report showed job creation fell 0.6 percent
quarter-on-quarter, or 0.7 percent year-on-year as French firms
laid off workers to take account for a drop in business. Carmaker Renault on Thursday scrapped its profit targets,
dropped its dividend, slashed output and warned that the crisis
would change the landscape of the car industry. The company also said it expected to reduce its headcount by
9,000 this year, through voluntary departures, around half of
which would be in France.  SCEPTICS President Nicolas Sarkozy has channelled 26 billion euros
into investment projects to try to stem the economy's decline,
and pumped billions of euros of loans into banks to shore up
their balance sheets and encourage them to start lending. But he has struggled to convince a sceptical public that he
chose the right strategy. Over a million people protested
earlier this month, complaining his package did nothing to save
jobs and help consumers. After the protests, Sarkozy announced 6.5 billion euros to
help the car sector. In a bid to please the French public, it
obliges the companies to keep jobs in France but this has
angered other countries who accused him of protectionism. Sarkozy argues that stimulus measures to target consumers
will not help the French economy as the money is often spent on
imported goods on shop shelves or goes into savings. The data also showed that consumption, which accounts for
almost two thirds of GDP, was not the main problem in the
economy last year. It climbed 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter
while business investment plunged 1.5 percent.  EXPORTS COLLAPSE Exports tumbled 3.7 percent. ""It is the steepest decline on record since 1978, so there
is something really nasty going on there,"" said Bank of America
economist Gilles Moec. ""There has been a weakness in French
exports for quite a while but this was not because of external
demand but the French lack of competitiveness. Now it is really
magnified by the downturn in external demand."" Sarkozy also has to consider deteriorating public finances
when he is thinking about new stimulus steps. A third report
showed the 2008 budget deficit grew to a record 56.2 billion
euros from 34.7 billion euros a year earlier. ""If you look (at 2008 data) public investment was actually
extremely low and that is going to be reversed in 2009 so there
will be a lot more deficit but that is a lesser problem,"" said
Xerfi economist Alexander Law. ""At the moment it is extremely
urgent to put the fire out."" (Reporting by Anna Willard, Veronique Tison, Crispian

1443,"Feb 12, 2009 03:32PM ET","UPDATE 2-French growth tumbles in Q4, govt sees 2009 in red",nan," (Recasts throughout, adding detail, background, comment) By Francois Murphy PARIS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - France's economy shrank at the
fastest pace in 34 years in the fourth quarter of 2008 as
business investment and exports collapsed, prompting the
government to say it expected negative growth this year. National statistics office INSEE said on Thursday gross
domestic product fell 1.2 percent in the last three months of
last year compared with the previous quarter, more than
expected, bringing economic growth for 2008 to 0.7 percent. Economists had predicted a quarterly fall of 1.1 percent
after growth of 0.1 percent in the third quarter. ""This bad figure reflects in large part a very significant
destocking by companies, which indicates a wait-and-see attitude
in the face of uncertain growth and the crisis in the automobile
sector,"" Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said in a statement. The figures were published a day early after a group of
statisticians leaked them in protest at the government's early
announcement of some statistics. The announcement by the euro zone's second biggest economy
came a day before fellow heavyweights Germany and Italy were
expected to announce their own steep GDP falls, and it followed
a similarly grim statement by Spain. Spain's economy shrank 1 percent in the fourth quarter, its
biggest quarterly fall in 15 years, pushing it into recession
for the first time since 1993. Lagarde said she expected GDP to fall by at least 1 percent
in 2009 but took heart from the fact that household consumption,
a key driver of French growth, had held up in the last quarter
of 2008, rising 0.5 percent. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has struggled to convince a
sceptical public that he has chosen the right strategy to fight
the economic downturn sparked by the global financial crisis. More than 1 million people took to the streets this month to
protest at his economic policies, which favour public investment
in projects such as building roads and modernising train lines
rather than giving more help directly to consumers. Sarkozy made a live television appearance last week to try
to win support for measures including his 26 billion euro
($33.16 billion) stimulus plan but polls have shown his approval
rating has fallen since then.  BRIGHT SPOTS Much of the GDP data published on Thursday will heighten
fears about the state of the economy. ""The fourth-quarter contraction is the worst since the
fourth quarter of 1974, after the first oil shock,"" BNP Paribas
analyst Dominique Barbet said. Business investment fell 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter
while public investment dropped 1.6 percent. Exports tumbled 3.7
percent and imports slid 2.2 percent, while stocks declined by
0.9 percent, data showed, confirming grim news from companies. France has announced it will provide 6 billion euros in
loans to its carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen, which
have been hit hard by the slowdown and complained of draconian
credit conditions. Peugeot said on Wednesday it expected to remain in the red
until 2010 after spending nearly 1 billion euros to slash stocks
of unsold cars last year and on Thursday Renault scrapped its
2009 profit targets, dropped its divided and slashed output. There were, however, some bright spots in the French data. ""The breakdown comes as a real surprise,"" Barbet said,
citing the robust household consumption figure. ""Other components of domestic demand also slightly exceeded
expectations, housing down only 0.3 percent quarter on quarter
and business investment down 1.5 percent,"" he said. Lagarde said France, like its neighbours, had suffered in
the downturn at the end of last year, and highlighted the fact
that French economy grew in the third quarter, a better
performance than many western European countries.

fiscal year, not end of 2008) * Arcandor says Q1 adjusted core earnings rise 18 percent * Says drops outlook due to lack of visibility * Arcandor shares unchanged in weaker market, Thomas Cook up 
 (Adds comments from CEO, details and background) DUESSELDORF, Feb 12 (Reuters) - German tourism and retail
group Arcandor became the latest company to get cold feet about
its prospects as it dropped its 2008/09 outlook, citing a lack
of visibility due to the financial crisis. French carmaker Renault abandoned its 2009 profit targets in
the face of an unprecedented crisis in the auto industry and
last week, consumer goods giant Unilever scrapped all its
targets. ""Like many other companies in consumer-related areas, we do
not consider a results forecast to be prudent due to the lacking
visibility of the effects from the economic and financial
crisis,"" Arcandor Chief Executive Thomas Middelhoff said on
Thursday. ""Nobody can say what next week or the week after will
bring,"" he said and pointed to Arcandor's sites located near
large automotive suppliers that are particularly hard hit. Middelhoff will hand over the reins on March 1 to
Karl-Gerhard Eick, who is currently chief financial officer at
Deutsche Telekom.  ""We saved the company, but there is still a lot to do. This,
of course, annoys me, because I would have liked to have handed
over the company in perfect condition,"" Middelhoff said.  Arcandor made a loss of about 58 million euros ($74.94
million) in the first quarter and the group's net debt rose to
1.4 billion euros from 802 million euros at the end of its
fiscal year on Sept. 30. This was mainly due to further restructuring costs at
Arcandor's travel arm Thomas Cook, Europe's second largest
travel company after TUI Travel, which makes up more than 90
percent of Arcandor's adjusted core profit. Thomas Cook reported a smaller operating loss for the first
quarter, which is one of its seasonally weakest, and said it was
confident of meeting full-year expectations. Thomas Cook shares rose 2.5 percent in London to 207 pence
by 1039 GMT and Arcandor shares were unchanged in Frankfurt,
while the German mid-cap index was down 1 percent. Middelhoff, who joined Arcandor in 2004 as chairman and
became chief executive in 2005, had initially aimed at a share
price of ""40 plus x"". ""One thing I haven't achieved is the share price,""
Middelhoff said, referring to his bold target. ""I shouldn't have said it like that."" In January, Arcandor had confirmed its previously given
outlook that saw 2008/09 adjusted operating earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at more
than 1.1 billion euros. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months to Dec. 30 rose 18
percent to 179.8 million euros on adjusted sales of 4.79 billion
euros, up 1.1 percent. The figures are adjusted for changes in
the reporting dates of Thomas Cook. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, which weighs
analysts' forecasts according to their track record, Arcandor
shares trade at about 4.6-times 12-month forecast earnings, at a
discount to peers like Metro or Douglas. Analysts referred to Arcandor's net debt situation combined
with a deteriorating retail environment as the main reasons. German retail sales unexpectedly fell for a third
consecutive month in December.

1446,"Feb 09, 2009 12:56PM ET",WRAPUP 4-EU summit called as protectionism row heats up,nan," * Czech EU presidency calls extra economic crisis summit * France unveils 6 billion euro car aid package * EU Commission plans to vet French auto aid plans 
 (Adds French minister saying no protectionism) By Jan Strupczewski and Jan Lopatka BRUSSELS/PRAGUE, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The Czech presidency of
the European Union, livid with French ""protectionist"" comments,
said on Monday it was calling an emergency EU summit to discuss
government responses to the economic crisis. France, where President Nicolas Sarkozy last week suggested
French carmakers move plants back home from the Czech Republic,
meanwhile unveiled plans to help its ailing auto manufacturers
with 6 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in government loans. With recession biting, governments in Europe and well beyond
have pledged to keep international trade channels open to avoid
the protectionist mistakes of the Great Depression years, though
fears that such pledges will not be respected are mounting. Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said protectionist
comments by Sarkozy drove him to call the summit, for which no
date has been set but may take place this month. However, it seems France also wants a meeting. In a letter to Topolanek, dated Feb. 9 and seen by Reuters,
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sarkozy said such a special
meeting was needed. ""The restoration of the supply of credit must be our top
priority,"" Merkel and Sarkozy wrote in the letter to the Czech
EU presidency, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. On Monday, Sarkozy announced the signature of deal on car
aid with the chiefs of PSA Peugeot-Citroen and Renault involving
pledges to each of a 3-billion-euro 5-year loan at 6 percent
interest.  PSA and Renault said their firms would not launch job cuts
in France this year, while a European Commission spokesman said
the EU's executive body would study the fine print of the rescue
for compliance with EU rules. Topalanek said Sarkozy's attitude risked casting the
27-nation EU into a vicious circle of ""beggar-thy-neighbour""
actions to protect national economies.
""The last impulse was the really selective and protectionist
steps and statements of, among others, President Sarkozy, that
led me to the intention to call this extraordinary council (EU
summit),"" Topolanek told a news conference in Prague. ""It is these kinds of statements, made by some European
statesmen, that will lead to a higher level of protectionism
among individual states,"" he warned. The European Commission said such a meeting could take place
in late February.
 TOXIC ASSETS Governments have committed hundreds of billions of dollars
worldwide to keeping the banking industry afloat after a boom
that turned to bust when the U.S. housing boom did likewise --
turning trillions of mortage debt derivatives into toxic assets
that are now weighing on the balance sheets of banks across the
industrialised world and shrinking lending. The International Monetary Fund says the economic downturn
that has come hand-in-hand with the financial crisis is likely
to be the worst since World War Two. The tension shown by Prague overshadowed Monday's meeting of
euro zone finance ministers. EU finance ministers meet on
Tuesday. Ministers were discussing budget policy and their message to
forthcoming meetings of the G7 and G20 clubs of, respectively,
rich and rich and developing economic powers. Some of those present said they were conscious of the need
to resist protectionism and ensure Europe responded in synch. ""I am a little bit concerned that day after day member state
after member state are announcing not only their own ideas but
their own plans and programmes,"" said Luxembourg's Jean-Claude
Juncker, head of the 16-nation Eurogroup of euro currency users. ""All this has to be better coordinated,"" he told reporters. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde defended Paris in
Brussels saying she would tell her colleagues ""there is not a
whiff of protectionism, that it's really the aim to focus on
research and development"". Earlier, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico criticised
Sarkozy's remarks about a possible return of French car
factories home and said his country, which hosts a plant owned
by PSA Peugeot Citroen, warned of possible retaliatory measures. ""Calls for such brutal protectionism are not helping
anyone,"" he told reporters in Bratislava. ""If one country starts behaving like this, for example
France, then we will send Gaz de France home. We can use the
money Gaz de France is getting as a shareholder in (Slovak gas
company) SPP,"" he added.

1447,"Feb 08, 2009 10:32PM ET",TOPWRAP 4-Barclays lands big profit; US rescue plans drag on,nan," * Barclays makes 6.1 billion pounds annual profit * U.S. politicians wrangle over stimulus bill * Nissan forecasts annual loss, to cut 20,000 jobs * France to announce car aid  
 (For more on the financial crisis, click on) By Steve Slater and Yumiko Nishitani LONDON/TOKYO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays booked
a 6.1 billion pounds ($9 billion) profit on Monday while
carmakers floundered, but investors focused squarely on the fate
of a U.S. stimulus bill worth more than $800 billion. Most companies around the world are under the cosh from the
worst economic crisis in decades and auto makers in particular
have been hammered by collapsing demand. Japan's No. 3 carmaker Nissan Motor Co. posted a big
quarterly loss and said it would lay off 20,000 workers. For the full year, Nissan now expects an operating loss --
its first in 14 years -- of 180 billion yen ($2 billion). Last
week, its larger peer Toyota forecast an operating loss for the
year would be about $5 billion. France will unveil details of a plan to support its ailing
auto sector later on Monday, an official at the presidential
office said. Both Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen are set to
announce poor 2008 results this week. French newspapers said President Nicolas Sarkozy would
announce a government loan of around 6 billion euros ($7.7
billion) to the pair. Their shares rose in response. In the United States, General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC
are racing to prove to the government they can be commercially
viable after receiving a $17.4 billion bailout. Barclays said it expected 2009 to be ""another challenging
year"" with credit market losses shrinking but bad debt charges
set to rise as recession takes a toll. Its 2008 pretax profit was down from 7.1 billion pounds in
2007 but ahead of most forecasts and included 8 billion pounds
in gross writedowns and bad debts. ""In 2008 we've had a crisis in the banking system; the
principal issue for 2009 is going to be rapid economic slowdown,
in a sense more a familiar but nonetheless pretty brutal
slowdown in economic growth all around the world,"" said Barclays
Chief Executive John Varley. The UK economy was likely to contract by at least 2 percent
this year, he said. Britain, the United States, Japan and the
euro zone are already in recession. The damage from the financial crisis in Europe was
highlighted by a 3.7 percent fall in German exports in December
and a Bank of France survey showing the French economy is
expected to shrink by 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 2009.  JAPAN LANGUISHING In Japan, data showed core machinery orders, a leading
indicator of the manufacturing-oriented economy, fell 1.7
percent to a two-decade low, and Japan's current account surplus
slid 92 percent in December from a year earlier. Corporate bankruptcies rose 16 percent to a six-year high in
January, with the number of bankruptcies among listed companies
at a record high for any financial year since World War Two,
research firm Tokyo Shoko Research said.  The Bank of Japan's top economist, Kazuo Monma, said prices
may stay in a downtrend for some time and that the central bank
needed to monitor whether price falls and increasing slack in
the economy may create a self-perpetuating spiral of price drops
and further slowing in economic activity. Emerging economies are also suffering, with India on Monday
forecasting 7.1 growth in its fiscal year 2008/09, the slowest
pace in six years. South Korea's LG Electronics said it aimed to cut $2.2
billion in costs and may shed jobs as it expects about a 20
percent sales fall in dollar terms this year.  U.S. DEBATE RUMBLES ON For all that, financial market focus stayed firmly on the
U.S. Congress, which remains sharply divided along party lines
on an $800 billion-plus economic plan. European stocks . fell as investors anxiously awaited the
approval of Washington's stimulus plan and bank rescue package.
Japan's Nikkei average closed 1.3 percent lower and U.S. stock
futures pointed to a lower start on Wall Street. Squabbling will resume over the plan on Monday when the
Democratic-led Senate, with the help of just a few Republicans,
votes to end debate on an $827 billion rescue package and clear
the way for passage of the measure on Tuesday. Negotiators will then seek to resolve differences between
the Senate bill and an $819 billion version passed earlier by
the House of Representatives without any Republican support. ""Negotiations will be difficult, but fun to watch,"" a
Republican aide said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is also preparing
to unveil a bank rescue plan detailing how the administration
will use the remaining $350 billion of a $700 billion bailout
programme set up late last year. His announcement was pushed back to Tuesday, from Monday, to
keep the focus on the stimulus bill.

 (Adds Daimler, more details on Italy aid, South Africa) By Chang-Ran Kim and Helen Massy-Beresford TOKYO/PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Toyota, the world's top
carmaker, said its losses were ballooning as world car sales
drop, while truckmaker Volvo swung to a fourth-quarter loss and
Italy readied aid for the ailing industry.  A sudden collapse in consumer demand last year battered
automakers who were forced to cut production and shed jobs,
leaving the sector and its related industries reeling. Governments have swung into action, preparing aid packages
to help out their struggling car sectors.  The Italian government on Friday approved a decree which
included incentives worth more than 1,500 euros for trading-in
cars which were more than 10 years old and buying a new one. The
total value of the package for the car industry is worth between
1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and 1.3 billion, a government
source said. South African car industry representatives said they had
approached the government for loans to help curb job losses. German's BMW, meanwhile, provided a rare glimmer of hope and
its shares rose as it earned a clear profit in 2008 with
fourth-quarter sales beating expectations. Fellow German car manufacturer Volkswagen AG'S January
vehicle sales plunged a fifth, according to a source close to
Europe's biggest auto maker.  SALES DOWN Daimler AG said sales of its luxury Mercedes-Benz brand
vehicles fell 34.5 percent in January. Sales of the group's
compact Smart car rose 3.1 percent year-on-year in the same
period. Toyota Motor Corp's operating loss for the year to end-March
would be 450 billion yen ($5 billion), three times the loss it
had forecast just six weeks ago. Its sales fell 34 percent last
month in the United States, its biggest market. ""This is absolutely awful. The earnings situation has
obviously deteriorated since last October when the company's
stock price plunged,"" said Yoshinori Nagano, chief strategist at
Daiwa Asset Management in Tokyo. The Japanese firm has already let most temporary workers go
and could cut full-time jobs in Britain and North America, a
company source said. Predicting further pain for the world auto industry, Moody's
Investors cut its credit rating on Toyota for the first time in
a decade. In Europe, world-number two truck maker Volvo said it
slipped to a surprise operating loss in the fourth quarter amid
plunging demand and warned that key markets were likely to fall
further this year. But shares rose on relief the company was
still able to generate cash. Elsewhere U.S. parts suppliers pressed for government aid
and as President Barack Obama urged swift passage of a $900
billion stimulus package for the world's largest economy. The auto supply industry employs more people directly than
car manufacturers and is in talks with the U.S. Treasury to
secure emergency funding to avoid a wave of bankruptcies.  ACCESS TO LOANS Auto suppliers have requested some $25 billion in
assistance, an amount that would double the U.S. government's
commitment to the auto sector at a time when sales are at their
lowest since the early 1980s. ""The key now is whether consumers in America will be able to
start securing loans again,"" Daiwa's Nagano said. ""Slumping
sales due to the dismal state of the economy may be inevitable,
but another big problem today is that consumers who can normally
get loans can't get them."" Bob McKenna, president of the Motor & Equipment

 * Nippon Steel may cut output as Voestalpine trims outlook 
 (Adds Italy new car sales figures) By Jason Webb and Marcel Michelson MADRID/PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Sales of new cars, for many
households the most expensive outlay after property, dropped
further in Asia and Europe in January as the savage downturn in
the industry left its mark on steelmakers on both continents. With consumers putting off big-ticket buys, new car sales
fell by a fifth in Japan last month and South Korea's automakers
moved a third fewer cars. Sales also tumbled 41.6 percent in Spain, 32.64 percent in
Italy and 8 percent in France. Consumers prefer to save their money because they fear for
their jobs and face tight credit markets. Many global carmakers have already cut production, idling
plants, laying off workers and delaying spending to cope with
weakening markets. Several have sought state aid to survive. As the crisis spreads to suppliers, Nippon Steel Corp said
it may cut its output further but would wait to see the output
plans of leading Japanese automakers for the April-June quarter
before making any changes. Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine, which generated 25 percent
of its 2007-08 revenue from the auto sector, cut its 2008-09
forecast amid a ""massive decline"" in demand and said it could
not give an outlook for the following year. The decline in Spanish car sales left manufacturers there
desperately in need of aid similar to that announced in other
European countries, industry association ANFAC said on Monday. France's 7.9 percent January decline came after a 15.8
percent drop in December, auto industry body CCFA said. Sales of
French brands dropped 14.8 percent and took their combined
market share to 50 percent. In Italy, where the government has yet to come up with
incentives to encourage drivers to buy cars, sales tumbled 32.64
percent for the month. Fiat saw sales for its three main brands drop 31.3 percent,
leaving it with a 32.06 percent share of its home market. U.S. data are also due later. Spain's rate of sales decline slowed from December's 49.9
percent drop, but in absolute terms, January's sales were
considerably worse than those of the preceding month as Spain's
recession mauled spending by heavily indebted consumers. ANFAC said government measures announced so far, including
loans for people who want to buy new cars to replace older, more
heavily polluting models, were insufficient. ""The industry urgently needs measures to boost demand ... In
countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, which have
lower production than Spain, they have taken measures to support
the industry in the form of (loan) guarantees,"" ANFAC said. Spain's economy tipped into recession in the second half of
2008 and unemployment has almost doubled to nearly 14 percent. Automakers have announced a wave of job cuts in Spain, where
marques with factories include General Motors, Ford, Renault,
Nissan, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Volkswagen.  U.S. SALES SEEN DOWN The Dow Jones Stoxx auto index was down 1.52 percent, after
a fall of some 10 percent this year and a 45 percent slide in
2008. In an interview, Honda's chief financial officer Yoichi Hojo
said January sales in the United States, the world's biggest car
market, fell by a similar margin to a 35 percent drop in
December, and it would take several months to bring down high
inventory levels. Japan's No. 2 automaker plans to operate its factories in
North America, Japan and Asia, excluding China, at just 60
percent of capacity in January-March.

1451,"Feb 02, 2009 05:48AM ET","Romania seen cutting rates as GDP slows, CPI steady",nan," * What: Romanian inflation, interest rates, Q4 GDP growth. * When: Jan. CPI Feb. 12, rates Feb. 4, GDP March 4. * Inflation seen steady, small majority sees 25-50 bps cut. * Q4 GDP seen slowing to 5.2 percent.  By Marius Zaharia BUCHAREST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank is
expected to cut interest rates for the first time in 19 months
on Wednesday to protect the strained economy, with analysts
nearly halving their 2009 growth forecasts over the last month. Storm clouds have begun gathering over Romania in recent
weeks, even though it largely escaped economic pain last year,
as major companies such as ArcelorMittal and Renault's carmaker
Dacia announce repeated work stoppages. Most analysts revised their economic growth forecasts after
November's industrial output data, which dropped by an
unexpected 11.5 percent on the year, signalled the effects of
shrinking euro zone demand could be more harmful in Romania. Ten out of 17 surveyed analysts expect the central bank to
cut interest rates, now at the highest level in the European
Union, to ease the cost of borrowing as external sources of cash
dry up for local businesses and consumers. Many said inflationary risks stemming from a weak currency
were now overshadowed by declining growth. ""Although substantial leu depreciation fuels inflation and
inflationary expectations, we believe the central bank is not
likely to ignore the deterioration in economic activity,"" said
ING's Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc, who forecast a 25 basis
points cut to 10 percent this month. Other countries in eastern Europe already began cutting
interest rates last year as growth figures started declining
sharply. Like many of them, Romania faces the burden of a frail
currency that lost 20 percent against the euro in the last three
months, but it also has the additional burden of bloated current
account and fiscal deficits. Prices are seen growing 6.3 percent on the year in January,
at the same pace as in the previous month, as the weak leu offsets the benefits of cheaper fuel. But analysts expect inflation worries to fade, helped by
falling demand stemming from rapidly slowing lending growth,
while concerns over economic growth will begin to prevail. The economic expansion is expected to slow to just over 5
percent in the fourth quarter, from 9.1 percent in the third,
bringing last year's growth to 7.8 percent. But this year's outlook appears more gloomy, as growth is
forecast at a modest 1.7 percent, compared to 3 percent in a 
similar Reuters survey last month. Moreover, 2009 forecasts vary from -3.5 percent to 4.1
percent, underlying deepening uncertainty over Romania's ability
to fight the cash shortage. ""The prospects for the real economy remain gloomy as some of
the most important industrial plants ... have already closed
temporarily, resulting in a further industrial production drop
and export volume fall,"" said Rozalia Pal, head of macroeconomic
research at UniCredit Tiriac Bank. Pal sees economic growth at 0.6 percent in 2009. She is one
of 10 analysts who see interest rates flat at 10.25 percent this
month.

their jobs in 2008, the worst toll since the end of World War
Two, data showed on Friday, and industrial output plunged across
Europe as the global economic crisis bit deeper. The U.S. unemployment rate jumped to 7.2 percent in December
and 524,000 people lost their jobs that month, U.S. surveys
showed. ""The job situation is ugly and is going to get uglier,"" said
Richard Yamarone, chief economist with Argus Research in New
York. ""There's no reason to expect hiring any time in the next
three to six months. We are not going to see any hiring until the
government steps in and acts. Talk doesn't work."" The rate, which jumped from 6.8 percent in November, was the
highest level since January 1993. Companies are cutting jobs
across the world because of the stranglehold on consumer and
corporate funding since a credit boom went bust a year and a
half ago.The U.S. job losses were however less than analysts had
expected and the data initially boosted stocks and knocked back
the dollar. U.S. stock futures pointed to a positive opening on Wall
Street. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.6 percent. Germany, Britain, France, Spain and Sweden meanwhile all
reported slumping industrial output on Friday, some of them
posting the worst figures in many years. Germany reported its biggest annual fall since 1993, dragged
down by a downturn among manufacturers that is threatening to
cause the worst recession in the country's post-war history. Preliminary Economy Ministry figures showed output fell by
10 percent year-on-year as demand for cars and other capital
goods faded across the globe. ""We're at the start of a really deep recession,"" said
Juergen Michels, an economist at Citigroup in London. British manufacturing output slumped much more than expected
in November, official data showed. Output fell 7.4 percent
year-on-year while the broader measure of industrial production
fell 6.9 percent, both the weakest since 1981. The figures are likely to reinforce expectations that
interest rates -- slashed to a historic low of 1.5 percent by
the Bank of England on Thursday -- will fall to near zero in the
coming months. France's industrial output also continued its downward
spiral in November, sliding a larger-than-expected 2.4 percent
month on month on the back of further woes in the car industry. ""This is catastrophic, but sadly it reflects the reality of
French industry,"" said Marc Touati, head of Global Equities in
Paris. The automobile industry has borne the brunt of the economic
storm in France, with output dropping 8.1 percent in November
after a dramatic 22.2 percent decline in October. Underscoring the problems faced by the sector, French
carmaker Renault on Friday posted a 4.2 percent drop in 2008
sales and said ""inventory management and reduction"" would remain
a priority throughout 2009. The picture was worse in neighbouring Spain, with industrial
output down a record 15.1 percent year on year in November and
analysts said the pressure was building on the European Central
Bank to cut interest rates again. ""The data is much worse that what the ECB was predicting as
recently as four weeks ago,"" said Jacques Cailloux, an economist
with Royal Bank of Scotland.   CAR MAKERS STRUGGLE Along with trillions of dollars in government stimulus
packages, central banks are cutting interest rates to
unprecedented levels in an effort to kickstart growth and stem
the rising tide of job losses. The Bank of England cut on Thursday took the rate to its
lowest level since the central bank was created in the 17th
century. The Korean cut reflected the plunge in export demand
and domestic consumption. Hyundai Motor Co, South Korea's top automaker, said on
Friday it plans to cut production at its domestic plants by
25-30 percent to offset a slump in demand. Smaller local rival Ssangyong Motor Co said it was seeking
court bankruptcy protection as the financial crisis further
pounded the worldwide car makers. Business confidence in China -- a star performer in the boom
that preceded the crisis -- plunged in the final three months of
2008, an official survey showed. Manufacturers were  hurt by
shrivelling U.S. and European demand and a weakening domestic
property sector. Japan's index of coincident economic indicators fell 2.8
points to a preliminary 94.9 in November from 97.7 in October,
government data showed, signalling that the world's
second-largest economy faces a deep recession. U.S. President-elect Barack Obama said the U.S. economy
could stay mired in recession for years without bold action. ""I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will
be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible,"" Obama
said in a speech in Fairfax, Virginia on Thursday. ""If nothing
is done, this recession could linger for years.""(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Angus MacSwan;

powerhouse, industrial output slumped 10 percent on the year,
its fastest pace of decline since 1993. In France, it fell a

the European Central Bank, which raised interest rates only last
July, is expected to chop another half percentage point off its
main lending rate to a record low of 2 percent next week. ""Further out, we believe the ECB will eventually bring
interest rates as low as 1.0 percent in the first half of 2009
as the euro zone suffers sharp recession,"" said Howard Archer,
chief European economist at consultancy Global Insight. The Bank of England, which also only started fighting the
coming recession in earnest in October, cut rates to a record
low of 1.5 percent this week, and will likely cut again next
month. British factory output dived 7.4 percent on the year, the
biggest drop since 1981 when Britain was in the middle of an
industrial meltdown that decimated its car firms and coal mines. In Sweden, industrial output fell 11.9 percent annually in
November and its central bank looks sure to slash rates further.  TOO LATE? But all the rate cuts in the world now will not prevent
Europe's major economies from having contracted sharply at the
end of last year as thousands of companies go to the wall and
hundreds of thousands lose their jobs. A senior German government source told Reuters on Friday the
German economy may have shrunk by as much as 2 percent in the
last three months of 2008. ""The financial crisis has pushed the German industry into a
condition of shock and awe,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at
ING Financial Markets. ""In terms of economic growth, the fourth
quarter of 2008 will make history as the worst quarter ever."" Things are not much better in Britain or France, Europe's
next biggest economies. After the data, analysts said British
GDP might have fallen by up to 1.5 percent between Oct and Dec,
putting the country in recession for the first time since 1992. The French economy, they said, could have shrunk by 1
percent in the fourth quarter. The autombile industry has so far
borne the brunt of the economic storm in France with Renault 
posting a 4.2 percent drop in 2008 sales on Friday. That story is being repeated across Europe as consumers
worried about their own jobs and unable to get new loans cut
back. Germany's BMW said on Friday its group sales fell by more
than 26 percent on the year in December. In Britain, Japanese carmaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on
Thursday it was going to cut 1,200 jobs as sales have slumped
upwards of 20 percent in recent months. ""Looking ahead, the industrial downturn looks set to
deepen,"" said Jennifer McKeown of consultancy Capital Economics. Leading economists have forecast the German downturn could
lead to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) of as much
as four percent this year, which would more be than four times
worse than the economy's previous postwar nadir. But with interest rates already approaching zero, central
banks are running out of room and may soon have to think about
more unconventional steps of boosting the economy. In the United States, where 524,000 people lost their jobs
in December alone, rates have already fallen to between 0 and
0.25 percent and the Federal Reserve has started buying up
assets in its own form of quantitative easing, or boosting the
money supply.

 (Adds comments from news conference) By Helen Massy-Beresford and Matthias Blamont BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT, France, Jan 9 (Reuters) - French
carmaker Renault posted a 4.2 percent drop in 2008 unit sales in
a world market that fell 4.8 percent, and set further reducing
its stock of unsold vehicles as a priority for 2009. Sales of Renault brand vehicles fell 5.4 percent while Dacia
brand sales rose 11.7 percent, for a market share that was
stable at 3.6 percent, the company said on Friday. On Tuesday, chief operating officer Patrick Pelata said
Renault had met its target of reducing vehicle stocks to
end-2007 levels by the end of 2008, but the company said on
Friday that ""inventory management and reduction will remain a
priority throughout 2009"". In common with other manufacturers, Renault has announced
job cuts and temporary plant closures as it struggles to cope
with a worldwide drop in vehicle sales. On Thursday, its 44-percent owned subsidiary Nissan- which
is not included in Renault group sales data - said it was
cutting 1,200 jobs at its Sunderland plant in northeast England
in response to the dramatic decline in demand. 
 Renault said it expected the auto industry to remain in
crisis in 2009 but it had three assets to boost its market share
-- a range of new models, the Renault Eco brand eligible for tax
breaks for emissions-friendlier vehicles, and a price range well
suited to the current economic conditions. Head of sales Patrick Blain told a news conference that
there were already some positive returns from a new French
scheme to subsidise the scrapping of old cars, and that he
expected further state credit support for the industry. There was no immediate response from the company to comments
from an unnamed government source quoted in daily Les Echos as
saying that Renault required 2.5 billion euros ($3.42 billion)
of funding.
 The government and carmakers are due to hold a summit
meeting on Jan. 20. MARKET SHARE STILL BELOW 2006 Total Renault sales in 2008 were 2.38 million cars and light
commercial vehicles, against 2.48 million in 2007. The group's
market share, while stable against 2007, eased slightly from the
3.7 percent registered in 2006. Vehicle sales will be boosted when Renault consolidates the
sales of Lada and other cars made by AvtoVAZ in Russia, in which
it took a blocking minority stake last year. Car sales fell across Europe in 2008, dipping 1.8 percent in
Germany, 28 percent in Spain and 13.4 percent in Italy.  In France the decline was limited to 0.7 percent as a tax
incentive on purchases of cleaner cars boosted sales of smaller
vehicles where Renault and bigger local rival PSA Peugeot
Citroen have a strong position. Renault is targeting a profit margin of between 2.5 percent
and 3.0 percent for 2008. Its financial results are due on Feb.
12. At 0940 GMT, Renault shares were up 4.1 percent at 21.18
euros, well above its November 2008 low of 14.4 euros and after
a drop of 81 percent last year. The Dow Jones Stoxx Auto index
was up 1.16 percent. (Writing by Marcel Michelson; editing by John Stonestreet)

dropped by a quarter in November, data showed on Tuesday as more
vehicle makers announced output cuts and the Big Three U.S.
players waited for the government to throw them a lifeline. Volkswagen's Spanish car maker Seat and world number two
truckmaker Volvo became the latest companies to announce
temporary production halts in response to falling sales as the
global economic slowdown batters the industry. Governments are rushing to support car manufacturers
struggling to cope with falling sales and difficulties shifting
their stocks of unsold vehicles. On Monday, France said it was ready to take action following
a meeting with top industry executives in return for commitments
to keep production in the country.. ""There's always a certain amount of posturing, but later,
outsourcing can be dressed up as new production,"" said one
Paris-based analyst who declined to be named. ""I think PSA is
less willing to make concessions than Renault,"" he added, noting
the French government's stake in Renault. In the U.S., the Bush administration could act as early as
Wednesday to approve an automaker bailout from its bank rescue
fund, with conditions likely to reflect at least those approved
by the U.S. House of Representatives last week, key lawmakers
and other sources said on Monday. GM and Chrysler LLC, which is owned by Cerberus Capital
Management, have said they need immediate cash injections to
survive. Ford is seeking a government line of credit it could
use if its financial position deteriorated more than expected in
2009. Carmakers are also seeking help from their suppliers: Toyota
Motor Corp plans to ask Nippon Steel Corp and other steelmakers
for a 30 percent price cut, the Nikkei business daily reported
on Tuesday.    Meanwhile, the world's fourth-largest steelmaker
POSCO said on Tuesday it may cut output next year if market
conditions continue to worsen. In a further sign of the financial constraints hitting auto
manufacturers, Fuji Heavy Industries said it would withdraw its
Subaru team from the world rally championship. Fellow Japanese
carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp announced its exit a day earlier,
leaving only Citroen and Ford chasing the manufacturers' title.  Honda Motor Co, Japan's No.2 automaker, this month quit
Formula One racing, saying it needed to conserve cash for its
core-automaking business.  European new passenger car registrations dropped 25.8
percent year-on-year according to the ACEA industry body on
Tuesday, the seventh consecutive monthly drop. ACEA said the last time registrations fell so sharply was in
1999 and in 1993, before EU enlargement, when the data only
covered the 15 EU member states plus the European Free Trade
Association countries. November's data referred to the 27 EU member states, plus
the EFTA countries and excluded Malta and Cyprus, ACEA said.  CUT CUT CUT Separately, Seat said it would further cut production at its
main plant in Catalonia in the first half of 2009 in response to
diving sales. The maker of the Ibiza and Leon said that between
Feb. 2 and June 30 it would halt work at its Martorell plant
near Barcelona for seven to 29 days on various production lines. General Motors said on Monday it would temporarily shut down
assembly lines at three of its Mexican car factories. The decline in November sales was not just in passenger cars
-- truck sales also fell, leading Volvo to stop production for
20 to 25 days in the first quarter of 2009. At 10.30 GMT the DJ Stoxx Auto Index was up 1.25 percent
while Peugeot's shares rose 1.51 percent and Volkswagen rose
0.72 percent.

posted its largest annual fall on record in October, dragged
down by the struggling car industry and adding to a grim outlook
for fourth quarter growth. Output fell 7.2 percent on an annual basis, the largest drop
since January 1991 when the series began, national statistics
office INSEE said on Wednesday. The month-on-month number was down 2.7 percent, the biggest
decline since May and far worse than the consensus forecast for
a fall of 0.6 percent. ""It's a catastrophe. I thought we would have a big fall but
obviously I did not imagine that it would be as catastrophic,""
said Dominique Barbet, economist at BNP Paribas. ""I had a forecast of -0.5 percent (for gross domestic
product in the fourth quarter) but now we will have to think
about revising that downwards. The economy grew just 0.1 percent in the third quarter and
economists are widely expecting the economy to tip into
recession next year. Output in the troubled car industry tumbled 14.3 percent,
the largest decline since August 1999, with firms halting
production in many factories following a slump in sales. ""The main problem out there is the auto sector. With the
closing down of factories in December and January the drop could
reach 20 to 25 percent month-on-month, which is really huge,""
said Alexander Law, chief economist with consultancy Xerfi. The government estimates France's car industry accounts for
about 10 percent of the work force or around 2.5 million jobs.  France's second largest carmaker Renault  has
already pledged to cut 6,000 jobs across Europe and is shutting
many of its sites for several weeks in December.  President Nicolas Sarkozy last week unveiled a 26 billion
euro ($33.76 billion) stimulus package to boost the economy
including steps to help the car industry. Other countries are also facing difficulties in the car
industry as consumers prefer to have old vehicles repaired than
splash out on new ones. In the United States, the House of Representative could vote
as early as Wednesday on a $15 billion plan to bail out U.S.
automakers, although the plan may face roadblocks in the senate. Outside the car sector, the French report also had worrying
news for other sectors of the economy. Production of consumer
goods fell 0.4 percent, capital goods tumbled 0.5 percent and
intermediary goods declined 3.5 percent.

as Congress weighs a $15 billion industry rescue. But with the steady backing of GM's board, Wagoner has faced
down previous threats to his leadership, including one in early
2006 as GM's sales began to sputter and losses mounted. Now, with GM at the brink of collapse, Wagoner's allies have
rallied to his defense and argue switching management now would
risk deepening the crisis for a fragile industry. Lee Iacocca, made famous as the CEO who steered Chrysler
through a turnaround on the strength of $1.5 billion in federal
loans in the early 1980s, endorsed Wagoner and his peers at
Chrysler LLC and Ford Motor Co in a statement on Tuesday. ""They're by far the best shot we have for success. I say give
them their marching orders and then let them march. They're the
right people to get the job done,"" Iacocca said. Tim Leuliette, chief executive of auto supply firm Dura
Automotive Systems, said calls for management changes could make
a bad situation worse. ""The refueling plane is poised to link up mid-air and give
them jet fuel, but the guys on the ground are calling for a
change in pilots before the planes link up,"" he said. CRITICS LINE UP Critics, including governance experts, are unmoved by
defenses of Wagoner, Detroit's longest-serving CEO, who ascended
to the top spot at GM in 2000. Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally joined that company in 2006
from Boeing Co. Bob Nardelli, controversial for a $210 million
severance package from the top job at Home Depot, was named
Chrysler CEO in 2007. ""I just find it very perplexing,"" said Jonathan Macey, a Yale
law professor who has studied the failures of corporate boards.
""Clearly, changes have to be made in these auto companies to make
them competitive. It's also clear that Wagoner's not the right
person for the job."" Others see GM's slide toward failure under Wagoner's tenure
as sufficient grounds to oust him and to shake up a complacent
board that has failed in its role as watchdog. Eight of the 13
directors on GM's board have served with Wagoner since 2003. ""I think the removal of the CEO has to be part of the
picture,"" said David Allon, portfolio manager at Firstrust
Financial Resources in Philadelphia, who owns GM preferred stock.
""I think the board has to recognize that Wagoner is in a
self-preservation mentality."" Wagoner, 55, is a veteran of GM's financial operations. Since
his ascension to CEO, GM's stock has lost more than 90 percent of
its value and common stock holders could be wiped out as GM
restructures its balance sheet. While he has agreed to work for $1 in 2009, as recently as
March GM's board gave Wagoner a 33-percent pay rise after two
years of self-imposed pay cuts. Over the past week, both GM and Wagoner have offered
apologies for the automaker's costly failures in recent years,
including a too-heavy reliance on trucks and SUVs. In an unusually frank apology, GM this week ran a print ad
acknowledging that it had ""disappointed"" and even ""betrayed"" U.S.
consumers with earlier sub-par cars and trucks. GM first argued that it had been driven to the brink of
failure by the credit crisis. The company dropped that line in
the face of withering criticism over Wagoner's decision to travel
to November bailout hearings in a private jet. Harley Shaiken, a labor law professor at the University of
California in Berkeley, said it was fair that Wagoner's tenure
was a question up for debate now. ""It doesn't mean that is the only alternative. It does mean
that it needs to be an option,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean that
getting rid of Wagoner is a necessity to go forward, but it does
mean that you are looking at some fundamental changes."" But Jeffrey Sonnefeld, a corporate governance expert at the
Yale School of Management, said it was already time for GM's
board to consider a charismatic successor for Wagoner to lead a
turnaround, such as Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan-Renault. ""I've been a supporter of Rick Wagoner's good faith efforts
at General Motors, but I think we're at the end of the tether,""
he said, saying the right outsider with a mix of marketing and
manufacturing experience would be less wedded to defending past
decisions at GM. ""The transformation would be magical. It would make business
history,"" Sonnefeld said.

1459,"Dec 09, 2008 11:50AM ET",UPDATE 3-Russian foreign car sales fall 15 pct in Nov,nan," (Adds bullet points, Putin imposing higher car import tariffs) * First monthly decline in 4 years of reporting * 23,857 fewer cars sold in Nov. 2008 than in Nov. 2007 * Compares with 9 percent year-on-year growth in Oct. 2008 * PM Putin signs laws to raise car import tariffs -agencies  By Simon Shuster and Olga Borodina MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Sales of foreign car brands in
Russia fell 15 percent in November, the first year-on-year
decline in at least four years, as a drought of cheap car loans
sapped Russia's dream of becoming Europe's top market next year. The Association of European Businesses in Russia said on
Tuesday 23,857 fewer foreign models were sold last month than in
November of 2007. It came in sharp contrast with October, when sales were
still 9 percent up year on year. Growth amounted to over 50
percent during some earlier months in 2008. The data also showed
foreign car sales rose 31 percent in January-November, far
slower than the 63 percent rise in the same period last year. ""We expect that the first half of 2009 will be particularly
tough for car makers,"" said Natalia Sorokina from bank Uralsib. Carmakers across Europe and Asia have reported already
subdued sales tumbling faster in November as the deepening
recession drives buyers from showrooms and prompts warnings of
more gloom next year. All major automakers have reported double-digit percentage
declines for U.S. auto sales in November. U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. said on Monday it would
suspend production at its Russian plant in December for a month.  French automaker Renault said it would stop the assembly
line at its Moscow plant for two weeks as demand weakens due to
the financial crisis. UralSib's Sorokina said more similar news would emerge soon.  HIGHER IMPORT TARIFFS The new data came hours before Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
signed legal amendments that will sharply raise import tariffs
on used cars, local agencies reported, a move that threatens to
make costs higher for some importers even as demand falls.As part of the protectionist measures, which could threaten
Russia's joining the World Trade Organization, an import duty of
30 percent will be placed on cars older than one year. The government announced the changes last month in an effort
to shore up domestic car production and support local players
such as AvtoVAZ. Almost all major car makers have in recent years opened or
planned to open plants in Russia, betting on rising income
fuelled by record prices for Russia's main export commodities --
oil, gas and metals. But with oil prices falling four-fold since reaching their
peaks in July and Russian unemployment rates rising fast, the
uncertainty for foreign car producers in Russia is growing. Car sales are still being supported by the relatively strong
rouble, but as the current account surplus is poised to fall
next year, the government will come under more pressure to
devalue the currency. That would be good news for Russian producers such as
AvtoVAZ, but a bad development for foreign car makers as their
models would become unaffordable for many Russians. Firms such as Toyota have already pegged their prices to the
dollar in a major vote of no confidence in the rouble after the
central bank allowed the currency to weaken with four
consecutive 1 percentage point moves over the past month. Among the major foreign carmakers working in Russia, the
worst hit was Hyundai Motors, whose November sales fell 36
percent year on year, or by nearly 6,500 cars. Mitsubishi was also hit badly, with a 51 percent drop last
month, or 5,800 fewer cars than a year ago. Following are November sales for the top 10 foreign car
brands in Russia compared with the same period of 2007, as well

(Adds details) ST PETERSBURG, Russia, Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Ford
Motor Co. said on Monday it would suspend production at its
Russian plant for one month, as the global financial crisis
slashes demand for cars. The company said the assembly line would be stopped from
Dec. 24 until Jan. 21 due to New Year holiday and the need to
reduce production volumes in December and January. ""The decision to temporarily cut production volumes at
Ford's Russian plant has been made by the company due to the
overall market environment and the lowering of forecasts for
total Russian car sales,"" Ford said. Employees will receive two-thirds of their wages during the
production halt, the company said. Ford also said it would delay the launch of production of
its Mondeo sedan to March 2009 from the fourth quarter of this
year.
Ford makes about 70,000 popular Focus models per year at
what is its only Russian plant, near the country's
second-biggest city of St Petersburg. Last month, French automaker Renault said it would stop the
assembly line at its Moscow plant for two weeks in December as
demand weakens.

1461,"Dec 04, 2008 04:00AM ET",UPDATE 1-French unemployment edges up to 7.7 pct in Q3,nan," (Adds details, reaction throughout) By Anna Willard PARIS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - France's unemployment rate rose
slightly in the third quarter, according to official data on
Thursday, as companies cut jobs in response to the financial
crisis and a slowing economy. The unemployment rate climbed to 7.7 percent from an
unrevised 7.6 percent in the second quarter, national statistics
office INSEE said. Economists have been expecting the number of jobless in
France to climb after the economy contracted in the second
quarter and narrowly escaped recession with growth of just 0.1
percent in the third. ""The economy is undergoing a strong slowdown even if we're
not officially in recession,"" said Dominique Barbet, economist
at BNP Paribas. ""The situation is quite clear and the deterioration of the
job market is tangible. The result is that the unemployment rate
is rising."" The unemployment rate excluding France's overseas
territories also climbed to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in the
second quarter.  INSEE no longer publishes a monthly unemployment figure
after a controversy over the method of calculation in 2006. However, the European Union statistics office Eurostat does
and it said on Nov. 28 that the jobless rate rose to 8.2 percent
in October from 8.0 percent in September, putting France above
the euro zone rate of 7.7 percent. ""Even if INSEE underestimates slightly that increase, the
rate is going to continue to rise,"" Barbet said.  STIMULUS President Nicolas Sarkozy's government has also forecast a
worsening job market but Economy Minister Christine Lagarde
played down the rise. ""The unemployment rate in metropolitan France rose slightly
in the third quarter despite a difficult economic context,"" her
office said in a statement. Sarkozy will unveil measures later on Thursday to help
France withstand the crisis and is expected to announce steps to
help the car and construction sectors where several companies
are making steep job cuts. Sarkozy will speak at a Renault  factory in Douai
in northern France at 1100 GMT. Renault is planning 6,000 job cuts across Europe while PSA
Peugeot-Citroen  is planning to cut 2,700 jobs in
France. French property group Nexity  has said it would cut
500 jobs and Bouygues  said on Monday it saw the
slowdown hitting its real estate operations in 2010. France is also hoping for help from the European Central
Bank which is meeting on Thursday and is expected cut interest
rates for the third time in less than two months. It is expected
to cut by at least 50 basis points. ""Given that there are no real growth prospects, inflation is
not a concern today, and with people even worrying about
deflation, the ECB has a role to play to re-launch the economy,""
said Bruno Cavalier, economist at Oddo.

working hours, extending normal year-end holidays and shutting
down factories to slow output at a time of slumping demand. Measures announced so far include:  FORD Ford in Germany is reducing output by nearly 4 percent this
year and cutting 500 part-time and temporary jobs, its head told
German newspaper Die Welt       MAN Shutting three German truck plants from Dec. 12 to Jan. 9 to

about 50,000 staff at four German plants from the start of
January through April.  BMW Suspended production at its factory in Leipzig for a week
last month and is operating only one shift a day there. The
company plans to cut 400 further temporary workers in Leipzig,
in addition to previously announced plans to cut 8,100 full-time
jobs around the world. It closed two other plants during
Bavarian autumn holidays from Nov. 3 to 7.  VOLKSWAGEN Considering suspending production at its main Wolfsburg
plant from Dec. 18 to Jan. 11. Its luxury brand Audi is
considering similar measures.   PORSCHE Closed its main plant for one day in November and plans to
shut for another seven days before end-January.  PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN Announced in October it would cut production by 30 percent
from what it had originally planned for the fourth quarter. Confirmed in November there would be site closures ranging
from a few days to a few weeks, without specifying which plants
would be closed and for how long. Announced on Nov. 20 it would cut up to 3,550 jobs. It is
due to present voluntary departure plans to its works council on
Dec. 2. The group has already cut 7,400 jobs through voluntary
redundancy since 2007.
 RENAULT Said in November it planned to cut output in an attempt to
get close to the 5.9 billion euros ($7.63 billion) of inventory
it had at the end of last year, by the end of 2008. The Dacia Pitesti plant in Romania was set to close from
Nov. 20 to Dec. 3 and STA Ruitz will shut from Dec. 10 to Jan 3. In Spain, the Valladolid assembly plant will stop production
for 11 days, while the Palencia plant will shut for seven days
in November and seven days in December. Renault will also stop the assembly line at its Moscow
plant, which produces the Logan, from Dec. 12 to Dec. 31. In September, the group announced a plan to cut 6,000 jobs

plants in Italy for four to six weeks in December and January. In addition, it halted production at its Mirafiori plant in
Turin for the last week of November. The measures come after Fiat had already shut down the
plants down for brief periods between August and November. In Brazil, it shut its Betim plant down from Nov. 11 to 26. Magneti Marelli, a Fiat subsidiary that makes electronic

1463,"Nov 26, 2008 04:14AM ET",UPDATE 1-French consumer confidence picks up unexpectedly,nan," By Brian Rohan PARIS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - French consumer confidence picked
up unexpectedly in November as falling inflation gave households
a slightly better view of their standard of living, data from
statistics office INSEE showed on Wednesday. INSEE's monthly reading of consumer confidence rose to -43
in November from an upwardly revised -46 the previous month,
considerably better than the -48 expected by analysts surveyed
by Reuters. But the survey also showed increasing concern about
unemployment risks, casting a shadow over hopes that spending
could help drive the economy forward in the months ahead. Economists said the picture painted by the survey, which hit
an all-time low in July and remains well below its 10-year
average of -16, remained bleak despite the relief provided by
easing pressure on prices. ""The deterioration in consumer sentiment has already taken
place and that's why it's not dropping as sharply as business
morale,"" Societe Generale economist Olivier Gasnier said. ""The slight improvement is linked to the drop in the
inflation rate,"" he said. Figures from Germany on Tuesday and on Wednesday from Sweden
also showed a better inflation outlook was driving unexpected
rises in sentiment. French consumer confidence has been in a rut for months and
a recent wave of job cuts at employers ranging from carmakers
Peugeot  and Renault  to temporary staffing
agency Adecco  have done nothing to help. Consumer spending figures last week showed French shoppers
increasingly wary about splashing out and analysts said worries
over unemployment, which showed up in a jump in the survey
reading on expectations of job losses, would weigh heavily. ""It's reasonable to expect that concerns about job security
will eventually gain the upper hand in the months to come,"" said
economist Tullia Bucco at Unicredit MIB in Milan. Consumer spending makes up just over half of the French
economy and a rise in the savings expectations component of the
survey suggested that many households would store up any benefit
from falling inflation rather than spending it. ""Under these conditions, consumer spending, the motor of
French growth, will have trouble starting up again,"" said

government will launch a major stimulus plan to revive the
flagging economy within the next 10 days, President Nicolas
Sarkozy said on Tuesday. Sarkozy said the plan would include measures to boost the
construction and car sectors, especially auto suppliers who have
been particularly hard hit by the recent economic slowdown. ""In less than 10 days we will announce a revival plan to
save the car industry...and strengthen the building sector,""
Sarkozy said in northern France, without giving further details. Speaking later in parliament, Prime Minister Francois Fillon
said the measures would include tax initiatives to help car
firms, saying they had around one million vehicles in stock. The government would also make investments to enable
companies to create hybrid and electric vehicles, he added. Coordination with the European Union and the new U.S.
administration would be crucial in implementing such a plan to
help the global economy, he said. The European Commission is seeking to get EU states to agree
to a broad range of measures, including temporary sales' tax
cuts, to pull the 27-nation bloc clear of recession.  France holds the rotating presidency of the European Union
and has pushed hard for an EU-wide response to the slowdown
following coordinated action earlier in the autumn to ease the
financial crisis that brought the banking system to its knees. Sarkozy said on Monday it was time ""to invest massively in
infrastructure, in research, in innovation, in education, in
training people, because it is now or never"". France has expressed frustration at Germany's more cautious
approach to the onset of recession, with Berlin unwilling to
commit vast amounts of cash to spurring the economy. A slew of poor economic data and results over the past month
have highlighted the challenge facing Europe, with the
continent's car firms already suffering. PSA Peugeot-Citroen announced last week it planned to cut
3,550 jobs across its sites in France, while Renault has said it
will cut 6,000 jobs across Europe. France's construction industry is also feeling the pinch.
Data released on Tuesday showed new housing starts fell 20.6
percent in the three months to the end of October.

1465,"Nov 24, 2008 06:30AM ET","UPDATE 1-Euro zone orders fall points to recession, ECB cut",nan," (Recasts with economists' comments, background) By Jan Strupczewski BRUSSELS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Falling demand for cars cut
euro zone industrial new orders by more than expected in
September from August, pointing to a deep industrial recession
and further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank. Orders in the 15-country currency area fell 3.9 percent
month-on-month for a 1.1 percent year-on-year contraction, the
European Union statistics office, Eurostat, said on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected orders to fall 3.0
percent monthly and 1.9 percent annually. The euro zone is in
technical recession after output shrank for a second straight
quarter in July-September, and economists see further decline. ""Coming after the August decline and what we know about the
business confidence for October and November, it does point to a
deep industrial recession, which will not be lost on the ECB,""
Holger Schmieding, economist at Bank of America, said. ""We expect a 50 basis point cut in December, with a chance
it could be 75 basis points,"" he said. The bank cut rates by 50 basis points in both October and
November to 3.25 percent as a sharply slowing economy eased wage
pressures and triggered an oil price plunge, which is quickly
bringing down inflation towards the ECB's target. Industrial orders indicate the level of future industrial
activity. The data only partly covers the period when the
year-old global credit crunch turned into the worst crisis on
financial markets since the 1930s in mid-September and October. ""The global financial crisis in the services sector has been
transferred to the manufacturing sector obviously by credit
constraint on manufacturers and also through the demand side in
emerging markets,"" BNP Paribas economist Dominic Bryant said.  CARS IN TROUBLE The fall in orders came mainly because of a 5.1 percent
month-on-month plunge in demand for metals and fabricated metal
products as well as a 3.8 percent fall in the volatile demand
for ships, planes and trains. The falling demand for metals is likely to stem mainly from
production cutbacks among carmakers, as lower credit
availability and the slowing economy sharply reduced consumer
demand, economists said. Car sales have fallen dramatically as the global financial
crisis has gathered steam. Carmakers are frantically trying to
keep up with the declines in the market by slashing costs and
extending the usual plant idling over Christmas to save cash. In western Europe, new car registrations in October plunged
15.5 percent to just over 1 million vehicles, dragged down by
extremely poor results for the Peugeot, Opel, Renault and Toyota
brands.  PSA Peugeot-Citroen SA, Europe's second-biggest carmaker
after Volkswagen AG in terms of European sales, said last week
it planned to cut 3,550 jobs in France.  German labour leaders at Daimler have said management
planned to reduce output of its Mercedes-Benz luxury cars by far
more than 80,000 units, cut the work week to 30 hours and offer
severance packages, after calculating it had 5,800 more staff on
its payroll than needed.  European auto makers have asked for 40 billion euros in soft
loans in state aid to weather the downturn.

 (Adds Merkel comments on U.S. bailout) By Mark John and Crispian Balmer BRUSSELS/PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The European Union is
studying support for its ailing carmakers but the bloc's
executive was divided on Tuesday over the extent of any aid as
other sectors also face a downturn. EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen signalled support
for a German offer to help the Opel unit of stricken U.S. auto
firm General Motors, but others in Brussels insisted there could
be no special treatment for the auto industry. ""You cannot compare the car sector with the financial
sector,"" Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, referring
to the mass bail-outs by EU governments last month of key banks
in the wake of the financial crisis. EU sources said the European Commission would propose ways
of helping the auto sector in the 27-nation bloc next week as
part of a broad package of economic stimulus measures to deal
with the worst financial crisis in 70 years . But any aid would be temporary, would have to meet the
bloc's strict state-aid rules, and be closely tied to goals such
as improving the sector's environmental performance rather than
no-strings-attached support, the sources told Reuters. ""What will not happen on Wednesday (next week) is a proposal
for old-style subsidies,"" said an EU source involved in the
dossier, declining to be identified because negotiations on the
exact details of the package remained ongoing. ""Any support for the car sector would be targeted, temporary
measures linked to certain objectives, not the dishing out of
billions of old-style aid ... Ecology is certainly an important
element,"" the source said.  WRITING CHEQUES Pressure on European leaders to help industrial giants such
as Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagenand Fiat rose after U.S. Senate
Democrats on Monday proposed a $25 billion loan programme for
their U.S. rivals. German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged U.S. lawmakers not to
discriminate against European auto manufacturers. ""We will observe very closely the way the United States
government acts regarding its own automobile industry, because
from the point of view of European industry we don't want the
Americans to adopt certain measures that could become a problem
for us,"" Merkel said during a joint news conference with Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at an Italo-German summit. European carmakers, a powerful lobby, have been stepping up
calls for up to 40 billion euros ($50.5 billion) of aid to
offset a fall in demand caused by a deepening recession, and
similar to the help given to banks hit by the credit crunch. Car sales have fallen dramatically as the global financial
crisis has gathered steam. Carmakers are frantically slashing
costs where possible and extending the usual plant idling over
Christmas by a few more weeks to save cash. In western Europe, new car registrations in October plunged
15.5 percent to just over 1 million vehicles, dragged down by
extremely poor results at the Peugeot, Opel, Renault and Toyota.  But many within the executive are loathe to start writing
blank cheques for the industry as it could open the floodgates
to similar requests, giving the impression that Brussels is a
one-stop shop for suffering industries. ""If your financial system is not working any more, then it
is over. That was our incentive to give medicine to its blood
circulation,"" Kroes said in Paris, explaining why the EU had
used some 2.2 trillion euros ($2.78 trillion) to prop up banks. ""The car industry won't be the last one (that runs into
difficulty), you can be sure about that, but we need to look to
the lessons of the financial institutions,"" she added. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other EU leaders agreed
in October to study support to the sector, and the Commission
last month hinted it could back the possibility of soft loans
from the EU's lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB).  STRICKEN OPEL Germany became the first country on to offer help to one of
its carmakers on Monday, offering to support Opel. But any such
would have to be approved by Brussels. The EU's Verheugen -- a German Social Democrat who has
championed the call by Europe's carmakers for soft loans -- told
German radio the Commission would have to examine any possible
guarantees. But he added: ""I'd welcome it if everything was done to
prevent an important and traditional car producer in Europe from
dropping out of the competition for reasons it's not responsible
for."" However, a second source said some in the Commission opposed
""Verheugen's carte blanche"" approach. The source said Brussels would insist that any loans, if
agreed, would depend on the industry producing ""greener"" cars,
in line with the bloc's ambitious goals to combat climate
change. A fly in the ointment of any agreement next week could be
its compatibility with World Trade Organisation rules. Brussels
has said it is scrutinising Washington's proposed support for

1467,"Nov 14, 2008 02:16AM ET","UPDATE 2-French economy grew in Q3, escaping recession",nan," (Adds confirmation, details, changes slug) By Anna Willard PARIS, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The French economy unexpectedly
grew 0.1 percent in the third quarter after shrinking in the
second, data showed on Friday, saving France from following
Germany into recession. Consumer spending and business investment held up well but
analysts said France would have a much grimmer fourth quarter as
the impact of the worsening financial crisis hit home. ""Whether we're in a recession or not is only a technical
debate,"" said Jean-Louis Mourier, economist at Aurel Leven.
""Both the surveys and indicators we've seen leave no doubt that
in spite of this slight rebound the economy is on quite a bad
trajectory."" Analysts in a Reuters poll had been expecting a contraction
of 0.1 percent in the third quarter which would have put France
in recession, defined as two quarters of negative growth' National statistics office INSEE, which had itself forecast
a 0.1 percent contraction in the third quarter, said second
quarter output was unrevised at -0.3 percent. ""Consumption and company investment are the two motors that
pulled France, pulled us ahead of Germany, ahead of Britain,""
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said after announcing the
numbers on RTL radio before their official release. German data showed the euro zone's largest economy fell into
recession in the third quarter, shrinking by a much sharper than
expected 0.5 percent. Britain's economy also contracted 0.5
percent in the third quarter. Euro zone GDP data is due out at 1000 GMT on Friday. The INSEE report said household spending, which accounts for
over half of GDP, rose 0.2 percent in the third quarter, after a
flat reading in the previous three months. Business investment was up 0.3 percent, a sharp reversal
after a 1.0 percent fall in the second quarter. But separate data provided further evidence that the French
jobs market was deteriorating. Non-farm payrolls fell 0.1
percent in the third quarter, INSEE said. ""The decline is due to industry, where jobs are being lost
regularly every quarter,"" said Domininque Barbet, economist at
BNP Paribas. In a third report released on Friday, INSEE said businesses
had sharply downgraded their outlook for industry investment
this year to a reading of 2 from a previous forecast of 6. The
quarterly survey of company bosses said they were expecting a
reading of -4 for 2009. Carmaker Renault announced in September it was cutting 6,000
jobs and stories of job cuts have filled French newspapers in
recent weeks. Adecco, the world's biggest staffing agency said
in October it plans to cut up to 600 jobs in France and will
merge about 75 branches as slowing economic growth forces it to
cut costs globally. (Additional reporting by Crispian Balmer, Brian Rohan,

1468,"Nov 10, 2008 08:10AM ET",UPDATE 1-EU's Juncker urges banks to do more to help economy,nan,"(Adds details on credit trends in France) By Tamora Vidaillet PARIS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - European banks have not responded
as much as leaders had hoped for when they launched measures to
support the financial system, Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude
Juncker said on Monday. Governments across the world have raced to shore up their
banking systems in the face of the global financial crisis in
recent weeks by taking measures including injecting capital into
troubled banks or offering credit guarantees. Speaking to France Inter radio, Juncker said that although
banks were taking some steps to resume activities, they needed
to do more to help the real economy. ""The banks have an enormous responsibility; they are
reacting, yes, but they are not reacting with the drive that we
were imagining when we had the support plans,"" said Juncker, who
is prime minister of Luxembourg as well as heading the group of
European finance ministers. ""The banks need to know that they are holding the health of
the real economy in their hands. If they don't show more drive
it would perhaps be necessary to revisit a certain number of
plans which we have put in place,"" he said, without elaborating. A survey last week from the Bank of France suggested that
credit conditions had tightened for companies despite a 360
billion euro ($464 billion) bank rescue package unveiled by
France last month.. More than 75 percent of French banks had sharpened lending
criteria between July and September, hitting small and
medium-sized companies more than large firms, according to the
survey from the French central bank. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has warned lenders
that the government could take direct stakes in banks that had
benefitted from public bailout packages but refused to open the
lending taps to companies. The Bank of France survey, conducted between Oct. 7 and 14,
suggested that banks may have to work harder given that over two
thirds of the banks polled intended to tighten their credit
allocation criteria in the final three months of the year. The banks also predicted slightly tighter credit conditions
for consumer loans at the end of the year, an area Juncker said
needed to be addressed. ""It is necessary to do everything to put an end to this
shrinkage in credit,"" he said. Juncker said the struggling automobile sector, a blackspot
given temporary plant closures by the likes of France's Renault
 and Peugeot, merited particular attention. ""We must examine very attentively the auto situation, we
cannot not see what the Americans are doing, we cannot accept a
situation in which the European auto sector disappears from the
global scene,"" he said. U.S. President-elect Barack Obama said on Friday that
federal help for the distressed auto industry was a ""high
priority"" of his transition.

1469,"Nov 10, 2008 04:42AM ET",UPDATE 1-French industry output falls as car sector suffers,nan," (Adds background, detail, analyst comment) By James Mackenzie PARIS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - French industrial production fell
in September, weighed down by a sharp drop in car manufacturing,
according to data on Monday which reinforced expectations that
France is heading into recession. Industrial output shrank 0.5 percent month-on-month in
September following an unrevised 0.4 percent fall in August, 
national statistics office INSEE said. The drop was slightly less than a 0.6 percent fall forecast
by economists polled by Reuters. However, it added to
expectations that gross domestic product figures on Friday will
show the euro zone's second largest economy contracted in the
third quarter as well as in the second, meaning the nation is in
recession. ""All of this data is consistent with an economy in recession
in the way we imagine it,"" said Alexander Law, chief economist
at Paris-based consultancy Xerfi. ""Total output of the economy, that is GDP growth, is going
to be negative in the third quarter and it looks very much like
we're heading that way also for the fourth quarter,"" he said. Economy Minister Christine Lagarde last week cut official
forecasts for growth next year to between 0.2-0.5 percent. Manufacturing industry, which excludes energy and
agricultural production, posted a 0.8 percent fall in output in
September, Monday's data showed. The sharpest drop was in the
automobile sector, which reported a 3.1 percent decline in
production. Like their counterparts worldwide, French carmakers have
been hit by sharp falling demand, with little sign of
improvement. The country's two main automobile groups, Renault and
Peugeot, have both been forced to shut plants temporarily and
stand workers down, pointing to even sharper production declines
in the next few months. Monday's industrial output data followed dire figures last
week when France posted its biggest trade deficit on record in
September as the economies of its major trading partners began
to suffer in the global slowdown. Output of semi-finished goods also fell 1.5 percent in
September, notably in metals, chemical and plastics products.
Energy output was down 0.7 percent. Last month's decision by ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest
steelmaker, to close half its furnaces in France temporarily
because of weaker demand, suggests that the trend will continue. By contrast, consumer goods output was up 0.4 percent,
capital equipment 0.7 percent, and food and agriculture 2.0
percent. Despite some volatility, the figures showed an overall 
slide in output over recent months, with production over the
past three months down 0.7 percent from the preceding quarter
and down 2.1 percent from the same three months a year earlier.

1470,"Nov 08, 2008 09:46AM ET",Renault suspends Argentina workers as exports fall,nan," BUENOS AIRES, Nov 8 (Reuters) - French auto maker Renault
plans to suspend workers in an Argentine plant as a global
economic slowdown hurts exports, local media reported on
Saturday. The Argentine labor ministry said Renault, which recently
announced 6,000 job cuts to help it maintain profitability,
would ask 1,000 workers at its Santa Isabel plant to stay off
the job for 11 days in November and December, the La Nacion
newspaper reported. ""Firings must be a last resort,"" said Labor Minister Carlos
Tomada. ""Sales to Mexico and Brazil, our two main external markets,
have totally stalled and for us exports are 27 percent of
sales,"" a Renault source told the Clarin newspaper. A global economic slowdown rooted in a credit crisis in the
United States has caused a near collapse in demand for cars,
leading U.S. auto companies to seek a $50 billion federal
bailout to survive the financial turmoil.

1471,"Nov 03, 2008 06:14AM ET",UPDATE 1-Spanish car sales drop 40 pct in October-ANFAC,nan," (Adds detail) MADRID, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Spanish car sales fell 40 percent
in October compared with the same month a year earlier, marking
the sixth consecutive month of declines amid a severe economic
slowdown, car manufacturers' association ANFAC said on Monday. Accumulated sales for the first 10 months of the year were
down 320,000, or 24 percent, from the same period a year
earlier, Anfac said. ""The seriousness of market circumstances, especially the
financial crisis and the lack of credit to finance durable goods
purchases, together with the increase in unemployment and
families' ever-decreasing disposable income, continues to reduce
the purchase of vehicles,"" Anfac said in a statement. Car manufacturers including Nissan <7201.T>, Ford ,
General Motors  and Volkswagen  have all
announced factory shutdowns in Spain in recent weeks in response
to falling demand. Anfac said on Oct 23 that car production had
fallen 12.4 percent in September compared with a year earlier. Sales of large people carriers, or multi-purpose vehicles
(MPVs), were the worst affected, falling 61 percent, while sales
of large and luxury 4X4 models declined 56 percent year-on-year.
Small cars were the least affected, falling 32.4 percent. Volkswagen was the top-selling brand with 8,365 sales
followed by its subsidiary Seat. The Seat Ibiza was No.1 selling
car (3,655) with the Renault Megane in second place (3,309). The slowdown in Spanish car showrooms followed data last
Thursday showing calendar adjusted retail sales fell 7.2 percent
in September as high inflation, low consumer confidence and
soaring unemployment hit spending on the high street.
