2,"May 30, 2019 02:10AM ET",Renault's Senard Says Jobs and Nissan Will Be Safe in Fiat Deal,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Convincing the stakeholders of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) on the merits of a merger may be the easy part. The hard task is selling the deal to Renault’s alliance partner Nissan Motor Co., (T:7201) as well as labor groups and politicians wary of job cuts.Jean-Dominique Senard, who’s been tapped to lead the combined Franco-Italian carmaker, is in Tokyo to make what may be the sales pitch of his career. In an interview on Thursday, he painted a picture of a grand alliance making and selling cars across the globe, keeping people employed and churning out profits.“It can only happen if people are open to it,” said Senard, 66, who attended a meeting for the board overseeing the alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He came to explain the merits of the Fiat-Renault deal to the Japanese executives, who started Wednesday’s meeting with many questions. By the end, the mood lightened and they were positive, he said.“A closer partnership can only improve the alliance,” Senard said. Nissan, which has pushed back in the past at attempts for closer integration, “understood the message I brought here, although obviously they can’t digest it in one night,” he added.After spending three days in Japan, Senard will return to Europe to work on bringing Fiat Chrysler and Renault together. He doesn’t anticipate any serious regulatory hurdles for the merger. Asked whether the joining of two European automakers would result in job cuts, Senard said the deal ""doesn't call for human sacrifice.""The merger won't involve any plant closures, according to Fiat, although it didn't mention any potential job cuts when the deal was announced. The combination also has the blessing of the Italian and French governments, which are constantly on guard against the risk of labor unrest.The transaction would be structured as a 50-50 ownership through a Dutch holding company, with Renault shareholders, including the French government, getting an implied premium of about 10%. Renault’s board is expected to give preliminary approval to the proposal as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter have said. Senard said on Thursday that the deal will take about a year to complete.Behind the push to consolidate are the various headwinds the industry is facing. Sales are decelerating in the world’s biggest car markets — China, the U.S. and Europe — bringing fresh urgency to consolidate. Automakers worldwide are facing intense pressure to spend heavily on electrification and autonomous vehicles, and adapting to trends such as car-sharing.Renault and Fiat Chrysler estimate cost savings of more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) from the merger. The automakers will focus on reducing platforms, simplifying product lines and focusing on quality and branding, Senard said. ""All of the brands are very famous,"" he said. ""Some have to be re-enhanced.""In order to sell more cars, Senard indicated profit-eroding price cuts in North America by Nissan and Chrysler would have to end. ""It needs to be about quality boosting market share,"" he said.Asked about recent comments by Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Peugeot owner Groupe PSA and former Ghosn protege, calling the deal a ""virtual takeover"" of Renault and that it could weaken or unwind the alliance with Nissan, Senard said: ""Everyone is free to say what they think.""Nissan could be a key part of forging a global group that could produce 15 million vehicles a year. The Yokohama-based company would complement the merged entity because of its strong presence in China, Japan and the rest of Asia, as well as its electric-car technology.There are signs that Senard’s charm offensive is yielding some results. Following the meeting, Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa said he saw potential opportunities for the existing alliance in Fiat Chrysler’s merger proposal, though he plans to study the matter further. As Saikawa put it, “we don’t consider this as a minus.”As to Senard, he said Nissan is already benefiting from the proposed merger given the increase in the Japanese carmaker’s shares on news of the deal. Nissan, 43% owned by Renault, would also finally have more tangible influence by gaining greater say in the alliance, he said.Under the proposed merger of Fiat Chrysler and Renault, Nissan would get 7.5% of the combined entity. The Japanese carmaker would be able to vote with those shares, unlike with its current holdings, which carry no voting rights. A merger would also dilute the French state’s control over Renault, and indirectly over Nissan, easing a concern it has had for years.Nissan needs some good news. The company recently forecast weak operating profit and cut its dividend for the first time in a decade. Senard said Nissan currently needs to focus on its profitability and that it’s in Renault’s interest for its Japanese partner to turn itself around.Fiat also said the combination would help cut costs by an additional 1 billion euros for Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.The alliance was destabilized late last year with the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its architect and chairman, for alleged financial crimes during his time as leader of Nissan. Ghosn has denied all charges and is preparing for his trial next year. Although Nissan and Renault have been partners for two decades, the Japanese automaker isn’t in a position to block the deal because the merger wouldn’t breach terms of their partnership.Senard, who replaced Ghosn as chairman of Renault and the alliance, has sought to restore stability following his predecessor’s arrest. The former  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO worked earlier this year with Nissan to craft a new governance structure to oversee the partnership, giving up concessions over board seats to assuage the Japanese firm’s concerns.""With Nissan, this is the first truly global car alliance,"" Senard said."

6,"May 13, 2019 04:18AM ET",StockBeat: Tariff Spotlight Shifts to European Automakers,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- The U.S. is now preparing to widen 25% tariffs on all imports from China. Will Europe be next?Autos aren’t the only sector faring badly after early trade Monday in Europe, but they’re clearly in the firing line after the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to use tariffs so forcefully over the weekend. A decision on whether to impose tariffs on European autos is due on Saturday and the signs aren’t good, with the U.S. administration's action against China over the weekend showing no sign of accepting conventional wisdom that tariffs choke growth and leave consumers worse off.“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.All of Europe’s big carmakers are down over 1% this morning, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down 2.8%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) down 1.4%,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) down 1.7%, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) down 1.2% and BMW (DE:BMWG) down 1.1%.  Renault  (PA:RENA) is faring slightly better, down only 0.5% as a result of separate news of it making a formal merger proposal to Nissan (T:7201).The escalation of the trade war is hitting markets generally, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.7% at 374.86 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.1%, Germany’s Dax is down 0.9% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.The extent of the threat is best seen, however, in its impact throughout the supply chain. Parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) is at the bottom of the CAC 40, down 3.5%, tiremakers Continental (DE:CONG) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) are also down sharply, and even chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are being affected by the general malaise, due to their exposure to the auto sector.All that said, the sector may get a stay of execution. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that “there are signs that (the deadline) could be extended because of the talks between the U.S. and China.”“We’re prepared for the worst,” she added, noting that the EU has drawn up a list of U.S. products that would also have tariffs imposed on them if the U.S. goes ahead with its threat"

8,"Apr 21, 2019 05:47AM ET",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,nan,"Investing.com - U.S. gross domestic product, a hectic week of earnings and interest rate decisions in Japan, Canada and Turkey will keep market watchers on their toes this week as markets return from Eater holidays. Financial markets in Europe are to remain closed on Monday.Here’s what you need to know to start your week.1. U.S. GDPAn advance reading of U.S. economic growth in the first three months of 2019 is set to be released on Friday. Growth was 2.2% in the final quarter of 2018.Economists are more upbeat about the first quarter growth outlook after data last week showing that the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in February as Chinese imports plunged in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs.Another report showed that U.S. retail sales grew at their strongest pace in one-and-a-half years in March.One closely tracked gauge of quarterly GDP, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow forecast model, showed Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.8% annualized rate in the first quarter.A month ago, GDPNow estimated annualized growth of just 0.2%, which would have been the lowest since a one-off GDP contraction in the first 2014 quarter.2. Other economic reportsAhead of the GDP report, data on Thursday will look at durable goods orders for March, with the consensus forecast for a rebound of 0.7% after a 1.6% decline in February. Other U.S. data includes reports on homes sales on Monday and Tuesday and a look at consumer sentiment on Friday.Germany’s Ifo business confidence index, due on Wednesday, will be closely watched amid lingering concerns over the outlook for the euro area’s largest economy at a time when European Central Bank policymakers are debating whether stimulus measures are enough to spur inflation.3. Earnings kick into high gearU.S. first quarter earnings season ramps up after getting off to a mixed start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all reporting.Also on the docket are Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS),  Lockheed Martin  Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY),  United Tech  (NYSE:UTX), Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), AT&T (NYSE:T), Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa (NYSE:V), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX).In Europe, the auto sector will be in focus with a flurry of earnings due from  Michelin  (PA:MICP),  Continental  (LON:0LQ1), Daimler (LON:0NXX),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), and  Renault  (PA:RENA). These stocks are particularly sensitive to growth in China and will be watched as the stirrings of a recovery were felt in recent Chinese GDP data .4. Central banksCentral banks in Japan, Canada and Turkey are all to hold meetings this week.The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold at its meeting on Thursday and to forecast that it expects inflation to remain below its 2% target.The BOJ is facing a daunting task in its years-long efforts to help push up inflation toward its 2% goal, with a slowdown in global growth and trade making its task even more difficult.The Bank of Canada will meet on Wednesday, with no change in interest rates expected.Turkey’s central bank is to announce its latest rate decision on Thursday, and is also expected to keep rates on hold. The lira has recently come under pressure amid speculation that the central bank is borrowing to boost its foreign currency reserves.5. U.S.-Japan trade talksDonald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are due to meet in the White House on Friday for talks on U.S.-Japan trade and efforts to contain North Korea’s nuclear program.Last week U.S. and Japanese officials held a first round of talks toward a new trade deal Trump has sought and the U.S. side raised concerns over the “very large” trade deficit with Tokyo.Discussions on North Korea are likely to cover next steps after Trump’s failed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.-- Reuters contributed to this report"

World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/CENTRAL PLANNINGThe 100 years since the Fed's creation in 1913 is said to be the century of central banking. Well, since the 2008-2009 crisis, we've certainly lived through a decade of central banking. But with monetary policy taken to the limit to lift growth and inflation, can central banks do any more?Of late, some of the economic and business confidence data is giving rise to hopes rate-setters might just be able to hold fire on further action for now. German and Japanese PMIs ticked modestly higher from March, and from China to the United States, the hope is that spring will bring some green shoots on the economic front. Central banks in Japan, Canada and Sweden hold meetings in coming days so we may get some clues on what they are thinking.ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos and Olli Rehn, widely tipped to succeed ECB Governor Mario Draghi, will also be quizzed on the subject at upcoming speeches, especially since sources tell Reuters ""a significant minority"" of ECB rate-setters doubt any recovery is underway. Central bankers in Australia and New Zealand have sounded similarly gloomy. A decade of central banking and planning is not over yet2/GDP NOW!The working thesis through the early months of 2019 was that U.S. economic growth would continue to tail off as tailwinds faded from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut and headwinds picked up from a weaker global economy, partial federal government shutdown and trade wars. Indeed, that looked to be the case as most economic data through the first quarter fell short of forecasts. As a result,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s U.S. economic surprise index came to near the most negative in around two years.But one closely tracked gauge of quarterly gross domestic product, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow model, has rebounded sharply in recent weeks and may be signaling that the advance reading of first quarter GDP may not be quite so grim.A month ago, GDPNow estimated an annualized 0.2 percent growth, which would have been the lowest since a one-off GDP contraction in the first 2014 quarter. Now the model forecasts quarterly growth will come in at 2.4 percent. That would not only top current estimates of 1.8 percent but would mean growth actually accelerated from the fourth quarter's 2.2 percent.One factor behind the turnaround was a surprise narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit as Chinese imports plunged in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs. By some estimates, trade could now contribute as much as one percentage point to first quarter GDP after being a washout in the fourth quarter.3/CORNER KICKAs we said above, central banks don't have much ammunition left in their arsenal. The toolbox is probably lightest at the Bank of Japan.At the G20 meeting in Washington, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was ready to expand monetary stimulus if needed. But he also said he had no plans to change the central bank's forward guidance, or the message it sends to signal policy intentions to financial markets. To many, that sounded like a man backed into a corner.Kuroda has a chance to prove otherwise at the upcoming BOJ meeting. Expectations are thin though, given the BOJ's balance sheet is already bigger than the country's economy and Japanese financial institutions are suffering immense pain from the prolonged monetary easing.The world's No. 3 economy may have contracted in the first quarter, and whether it recovers depends much on first, whether China recovers too and second, on whether the trade conflict between the other two powers sharing the podium reaches a resolution.3/TAKING A DIP IN EUROPEThe United States is widely seen as heading into an earnings recession (defined as two straight quarters of negative year-on-year earnings growth) but Europe might, at least for now, escape one.European firms are expected to deliver their first quarter of negative earnings growth since 2016 - the latest I/B/E/S Refinitiv analysis predicts Q1 earnings to fall 3.4 percent year-on-year. But it expects results to pick up again in Q2.So despite this quarter's poor outcome, hopes for a bounce-back could keep equities buoyant. After all, sentiment is already rock bottom - investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) named ""short European equities"" the most crowded trade for the second month running.The auto sector will be in focus in coming days with a flurry of earnings from  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Continental, Daimler, Peugeot, and  Renault  (PA:RENA). These stocks are particularly sensitive to growth in China and will be watched as the stirrings of a recovery were felt in recent Chinese GDP data .5/ RUSSIAN ROULETTEThe past two years have seen an increasingly bitter rift open up between President Donald Trump's Republican supporters and his Democrat critics over the alleged collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign in the 2016 U.S. election.That may not be defused even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 400-page report on the subject is unveiled by Atttorney General William Barr. He has already told lawmakers the investigation ""did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.""But that is unlikely to stop U.S. politicians from continuing their clamor for sanctions against Russia. As for investors, their appetite for Russian assets has not so far been dented. After plummeting last year, foreign buying of rouble-denominated government bonds has recovered sharply so it remains to be seen whether that bullishness continues.Meanwhile, Ukraine -- the reason behind the original 2014 sanctions on Russia -- looks set to elect comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy as president. Could the election of a new leader bring about some rapprochement between Kiev and Moscow? Watch this space."
10,"Apr 01, 2019 06:21PM ET",Exclusive: Renault alerts prosecutors to Oman dealer payments under Ghosn,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) has alerted French prosecutors to payments made to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman under former Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn, three sources told Reuters.This follows an internal investigation by the French carmaker after Ghosn's November arrest in Japan for suspected financial misconduct at its alliance partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd .Renault has established it paid out millions of euros described as dealer incentives to Omani distributor Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA) over five years from around 2011, said the sources, who were briefed on the findings. Nissan previously found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to SBA.But the information sent to French prosecutors shows that much of the cash was then channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said.The total sum paid by Renault is in the double-digit millions, one source said.""We categorically deny the allegations of potential embezzlement in Oman,"" Ghosn's French lawyer Jean-Yves Le Borgne said, declining further comment.Renault spokesman Frederic Texier declined to comment, while the French financial prosecutor's office did not respond to requests for comment and SBA could not be reached for comment.Responding last month to earlier reports about the Nissan payments via SBA, a Ghosn family spokesman said: ""The dealer incentive payments were directed by regional heads, not the CEO, and rewarded top performing dealers around the world.""Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan on charges that he failed to report $82 million in Nissan pay he had arranged to receive after retirement. He has also been indicted for transferring personal investment losses to Nissan and steering $14.7 million in company funds to Saudi businessman Khaled Al-Juffali.Renault initially sought to avoid being drawn into the investigation initiated by Nissan - which ousted Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest - and for weeks avoided sharing the Japanese partner's findings with its own board.But Ghosn was eventually forced out as Renault chairman and CEO in January, when  Michelin  (PA:MICP) veteran Jean-Dominique Senard was appointed chairman, and the alliance partners embarked on an independent audit of their joint finances the following month.FOUR JETSBorn in Brazil to Lebanese parents, Ghosn, 65, returned to Lebanon as a child and retains a powerful network of friends and associates there. A Beirut house was among several properties around the world that were purchased by Nissan for his use, as the company's investigation revealed early on.The joint audit of the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organization has tallied 1.2 million euros ($1.34 million) in Lebanese donations and other spending of questionable benefit to the carmakers, among preliminary results presented to Renault directors this week, two people familiar with the matter said.The audit is examining the use of four corporate jets financed by the Dutch-registered subsidiary and payments of around 170,000 euros annually to Carlos Abou Jaoude, Ghosn's personal lawyer in Lebanon, over six years, the sources said. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the lawyer.In an earlier complaint filed with French prosecutors in February, Renault turned over evidence that the 50,000-euro rental cost of Ghosn's Chateau de Versailles wedding in 2016 had been improperly charged to the company.But the alleged Oman connection may deepen Renault's exposure to the scandal unearthed by its Japanese partner, which has strained their 20-year-old alliance, and raises questions about governance at the French parent company.Cash from Ghosn's own ""CEO office"" budgets at Renault as well as Nissan moved through the regional sales divisions to SBA and on to a Lebanese intermediary, ""Good Faith Investments Holding"", the three people briefed on the findings said.From there it flowed on to privately held entities including a British Virgin Islands-registered vehicle that paid for a $15 million yacht, they said.Renault's findings, delivered to prosecutors late last week, also include evidence suggesting that some of the funds were passed to a California-based company co-founded by Carlos Ghosn's son, Anthony Ghosn, the sources said.There was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Anthony Ghosn or that he knew about the origin of the funds invested in his firm, Shogun Investments LLC. The Ghosn family spokesman, who also represents Anthony, declined to comment.Carlos Ghosn has not been charged with any offences in relation to the findings of either carmaker concerning incentive payments to SBA, the Omani partner, the spokesman added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

13,"Feb 14, 2019 03:53AM ET",Renault embarks on post-Ghosn era with lower profit goal,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) set a weaker full-year profit goal on Thursday, citing currency challenges and market uncertainties, as the French carmaker presented annual results without its recently ousted CEO Carlos Ghosn for the first time in 13 years.Under new leadership since Ghosn's forced resignation last month over financial misconduct allegations, Renault targeted profitability of ""around 6 percent"" in 2019, compared with a 6.3 percent operating margin recorded last year.Revenue and profit both declined as expected on the combined effect of currency setbacks, a withdrawal from Iran and a diesel sales collapse that hit engine production for Renault's alliance partner Nissan and affiliate Daimler.The results nonetheless met Renault's own targets, including revenue growth before currency effects and an operating margin above 6 percent, on the way to its mid-term objective to exceed 7 percent in 2022.""2018 was clearly a challenging year in which we faced expected as well as unexpected difficulties,"" new Chief Executive Thierry Bollore said, adding that the results ""demonstrate the group's resilience"".Renault shares, which have lost about one-third of their value over the past 12 months, were up 3.8 percent at 58.84 euros as of 0840 GMT.UNDER NEW MANAGEMENTBollore, formerly Ghosn's deputy, was promoted to CEO on Jan. 24, with outgoing  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard taking over the departed leader's role as chairman.Ghosn faces trial in Japan after a Nissan internal probe uncovered evidence of misconduct including failure to declare more than $80 million in deferred income - straining relations with 43.4 percent-owner Renault. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.Renault said on Wednesday it had blocked 30 million euros in deferred and severance pay to Ghosn, who had served as its CEO since 2005, and as chairman for almost a decade.Underscoring challenges to alliance cooperation, Renault's sales to Nissan and other partners fell by 946 million euros ($1.1 billion) in 2018, reflecting collapsing diesel demand. A further negative impact is expected this year, the company said.Nissan's contribution to Renault earnings came in at 1.51 billion euros, a 46 percent decline from 2017, when the Japanese carmaker's profit was inflated by one-off gains.Renault's own cost-saving efforts in purchasing and manufacturing contributed 421 million euros to profit, a 37 percent decline.Overall revenue fell 2.3 percent to 57.42 billion euros, while recurring operating profit dropped 6.3 percent to 3.61 billion. Net income amounted to 3.3 billion euros, down sharply from the 5.31 billion recorded in 2017, partly reflecting the exceptional year-earlier gain from Nissan.Excluding currency effects, revenue would have risen 2.5 percent, Renault said. Analysts had expected recurring operating profit of 3.52 billion euros on revenue of 58.1 billion, based on the median of 12 estimates from an Infront Data poll.The carmaker said it saw no need for any financial provisions in relation to the scandal and ongoing investigation into Ghosn's conduct and executive payments by Renault and the jointly owned Renault-Nissan BV alliance management company.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Feb 14, 2019 02:11AM ET","Not time yet to discuss Nissan chairmanship, Renault's Senard says",nan,"By Naomi TajitsuTOKYO (Reuters) - The new chairman of French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) on Thursday said it was not the time to discuss whether he would also take the helm of Nissan, as he arrived in Japan to reaffirm an alliance rocked by the arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.The comment from Jean-Dominique Senard, reported by Japanese media, appeared aimed at avoiding putting further strain on an alliance that some in Japan see as unequal. Senard's visit is the first by Renault's top brass since Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November over allegations of financial misconduct.The downfall of one of the world's best-known executives has stunned the global auto industry and heightened tension between Renault and Nissan Motor Co. Senard is expected to meet Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa during his two-day visit.Senard said it was not the time to discuss whether he would also assume the chairmanship of Nissan, and that he expected discussions to be amicable, Jiji news agency reported, without giving direct quotes.Senard was appointed chairman of the French automaker three weeks ago, and is also expected to be named to Nissan's board, given Renault's 43 percent stake in the Japanese firm. He is expected to visit Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama on Thursday and Friday to meet with board members and management teams.The visit is aimed as a friendly, introductory call, according to sources familiar with the matter. But tension has been building between the two sides, with Renault initially backing Ghosn until he was forced to resign as chairman and CEO last month.Some Nissan executives have long been unhappy with what they see as Renault's outsized influence over Nissan - the Japanese automaker, in turn, holds a 15 percent, non-voting stake in Renault. A focus now will be on who becomes the next chairman of Nissan, a role previously held by Renault's chairman. Nissan has said one of the reasons Ghosn was able to carry out his alleged fiscal misconduct was a concentration of power in one executive.Ghosn denies wrongdoing. DRIVING FORCE""There are various topics to discuss, but my responsibility is to Nissan stakeholders, to employees and customers and shareholders other than Renault, and Mr. Senard is in the same position,"" Nissan's Saikawa told reporters on Thursday.""The main thing is to talk about the future responsibly."" Ghosn himself was the driving force in the alliance, which was sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy and enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Ghosn had been pushing for a deeper tie-up between Nissan and Renault, including possibly a full merger, despite reservations at Nissan.Senard's appointment in late January helped quell a leadership debate which erupted after Nissan dismissed Ghosn immediately after his arrest while Renault had initially stuck by the executive, and has opened a path for Renault and Nissan re-examine the operations and structure of their alliance.Joining Renault from tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Senard is generally seen by Nissan as a welcome outsider who could provide more balance to the alliance, over which Nissan has said Ghosn held excessive control given his roles as chairman of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, along with being Renault CEO.Senard's meeting with Saikawa would be the second since they first met face-to-face late last month.Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said Senard would also meet executives at Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan holds a controlling stake. Meanwhile, Ghosn, in custody at a detention centre in Tokyo for nearly three months, on Wednesday replaced his chief attorney with a legal team headed by one of Japan's most fiery lawyers in a move seen as taking on a more aggressive strategy in fighting his charges, which he denies.Regardless of the tensions, however, analysts say the automakers need the alliance to compete better with rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp. Renault announced on Thursday that revenue and profit fell in 2018, hit by collapsing diesel sales, exchange-rate setbacks and a withdrawal from the Iranian market. Nissan earlier in the week said its annual profit will plumb six-year lows due to waning global sales and an ongoing slump in its U.S. operations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

18,"Feb 12, 2019 04:55AM ET",MarketPulse Europe - Automotives Bounce After Michelin Update,nan,"Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are broadly higher on Tuesday on hopes that another U.S. government shutdown can be avoided, and on the back of some positive earnings surprises.Automakers and their suppliers are faring well after French tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) raised its dividend and gave a solid – if still ‘mixed’ – outlook for 2019. Its shares, which lost over 30% in 2018, rose over 10%, also pulling rivals Continental (DE:CONG) and Pirelli (MI:PIRC) higher.The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index was up 2.1% by 04:45 AM ET (0945 GMT), while the benchmark Stoxx 50 was up 0.7% at 3,189.15.Tiremakers, like most automotive stocks, have been seen by some analysts as oversold after a relentless stream of bad news last year, most of it related to the U.S.-China trade war.The news continues to be largely negative – Nissan slashed its profit forecast by nearly 20% this morning for the fiscal year ending in March, and there is no sign of a breakthrough yet in the trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Beijing. But the reaction to the Michelin numbers suggest that, for now at least, more than enough bad news has been priced in already.Elsewhere, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) more than met expectations for the fourth quarter, but its shares added only 0.6% after rallying 14% already this year on the back of strong earnings from its peers in the luxury sector.While all the noise around luxury groups has been mainly about Chinese demand holding up well, it was the U.S. which gave Kering the biggest kick to sales last year: revenues from North America rose 37.8%, while those in Asia-Pacific rose ‘only’ 33.8%."

""First of all, we have to restore trust and stabilize the relationship,"" the Nikkei quoted Saikawa as saying. ""We want him to know more about Nissan's (management) team.""Kyodo news reported that Senard would visit for two days from Feb. 14. Senard, formerly CEO of tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), joined  Renault  as chairman in late January after Ghosn was forced to resign from the French automaker in the wake of his arrest on allegations of financial misconduct. Ghosn has been indicted in Japan for under-reporting his Nissan salary for eight years and temporarily transferring personal losses on to the automaker's books around during the global financial crisis. The once-feted executive, credited for turning around both Renault and Nissan, remains in detention as he awaits trial that could be several months away. He denies any wrongdoing.Speculation about the future capital structure of the Renault-Nissan partnership has been rife since the arrest of Ghosn, who had been exploring ways to make the alliance ""irreversible"" before his arrest.But Saikawa has argued it is not time to discuss the ideal structure of the alliance, although he has said he wants to work closely with Senard who will likely sit on Nissan's board.The automaking alliance has been underpinned by Renault's 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault. The French government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault.The head of Japan's industry ministry on Tuesday denied media reports that the government had been told by France that it could lower its stake in Nissan, Jiji news reported, echoing a similar denial by France's finance ministry last week.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

20,"Feb 07, 2019 05:15AM ET","MarketPulse Europe: Automotive, Travel Woes in Focus as EU Cuts Forecasts",nan,"Investing.com -- It’s another cheerless day in Europe’s stock markets as more evidence of the damage from the U.S.-China trade war comes to light and the EU slashes its growth forecasts.The mood has been grim in the automotive sector for some months and wasn't helped by  Daimler  's (DE:DAIGn) profit fall and dividend cut Wednesday. Another drop in German industrial output, out Thursday, is consistent with that, but it’s  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which announced a big recall of Dodge Ram trucks Wednesday (and which reports fourth-quarter earnings later today), that’s the biggest loser.At 05:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT) the Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 23 points, or 0.7%, at 3189.65.Those lower down the auto food chain are also suffering. Osram Licht AG (DE:OSRn) – the Siemens lighting spin-off that is a big supplier to the auto industry – said it swung to a loss in the three months to December thanks to the slowdown in China, and in automotive in particular. That's weighing on other suppliers such as Continental (DE:CONG) and Covestro (DE:1COV) in Germany, and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France.Travel companies are again making negative headlines: Tui AG NA (DE:TUIGn) fell over 16% after missing its 2018 profit target and saying that 2019 margins look weaker. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook (LON:TCG), which lost over 75% last year, rose after saying it’s looking at selling its airline business, and Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) confirmed a $257 million loss last year after a 71% rise in its fuel costs.The good news is coming, again, from the energy and the food and drink sectors.  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP), maker of Jameson’s whiskey and Martell cognac, followed  Diageo  (LON:DGE) in reporting strong fourth-quarter numbers and predicting a robust 2019. And French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) reported a record year for output and beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit, but its shares edged down slightly.Italy’s bombed-out banks are also having a strong morning after Unicredit (MI:CRDI) posted its highest annual profit in a decade – despite the headwinds from its operations in Turkey and its home market. Rivals  Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA (MI:ISP) also reported stronger-than-expected numbers Wednesday."
21,"Jan 27, 2019 10:20PM ET","Ghosn Jail Time Is `Too Long, Too Hard,' Macron Tells Japan",nan,"(Bloomberg) -- French President Emmanuel Macron told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he’s worried about Carlos Ghosn’s conditions in jail, making his strongest comments yet on the fallen car titan and the scandal that has rocked  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s decades-old alliance with Nissan Motor Co.“All I’ll say is that I felt the detention was too long and too hard, and I told Abe that,” Macron told reporters in Cairo, referring to a telephone conversation with Abe on Friday. “I’m just concerned that the case of a French citizen should respect basic decency.”Macron’s views follow days after Ghosn stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of France’s largest carmaker and two months after Nissan booted him out, with the attention shifting to the future of the partnership. While Renault named  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO Jean-Dominique Senard as its chairman last week, the French leader has reportedly suggested the executive be made Nissan’s chairman as well to help manage the alliance.With his public remarks on the case, Macron risks being seen as meddling in Japan’s justice system. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Monday that due process is being followed in Ghosn’s detention and investigation.“It is being carried out by highly independent investigative authorities, based on appropriate procedures and strict legal judgment, including the orders of the court,” Suga said. He also said the two carmakers should decide on who becomes Nissan’s chairman, pushing back on the idea of governments getting involved in the talks.Ghosn has been in custody since his Nov. 19 arrest in Tokyo, indicted for allegedly understating his income at Nissan and transferring personal trading losses to the carmaker. He’s been denied bail repeatedly after prosecutors argued he’s a flight risk, while his lawyers say he could stay in custody until a trial that may be six months away. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing.Macron’s involvement in the affairs of the two companies is mainly because of the power the French state wields over Renault. The government owns 15 percent of Renault with extra voting rights, while the latter holds about 43 percent of Nissan with voting rights, giving French leaders indirect say in decisions that sometimes affect the Japanese carmaker.Nissan has a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault, which also appointed Thierry Bollore as its CEO.While both companies have repeatedly said they are committed to the partnership, Nissan has long been unhappy about what it considers an out-sized French role in the alliance, whose third member is Mitsubishi Motors Corp.“We will be diligent to ensure the stability of the group,” Macron said.Renault-Nissan alliance executives will meet this week in Amsterdam, where the company that manages the partnership is based, people familiar with the matter said. The meeting would be the first since Ghosn quit.In an unexpected twist, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, a former protege of Ghosn who led the campaign against his ex-boss, said he too intends to step down in coming months after reforming the poor governance he says weakened the Japanese carmaker. Nissan has also been indicted by prosecutors.Macron also has a history with Renault. On Sunday, he defended an increase in the French stake in 2015 on his watch as economy minister. It was a move that had rattled Nissan.“I was happy I intervened, because I felt that Ghosn had gone too far in the ‘Nipponization’ of the group,” he said.(Updates with Japan government comments in fourth paragraph.

Stark, who is currently head of Procurement and Supplier Quality at Mercedes-Benz said the shift toward electric and connected cars has made it more dependent on battery cell chemistry and connected vehicles expertise from outside the company.""We will think about partnerships in some areas. The role of partnerships as a whole will gain in importance,"" Stark said during a news conference in Stuttgart to discuss the German carmaker's procurement strategy.Mercedes-Benz will rely more on its suppliers to take a leading role in the area of research and development as well as to identify cost-cutting potential through process optimization, Stark said.""We will intensify scouting of Chinese suppliers. China is more advanced than the United States in many areas of digital innovation,"" Stark said on Thursday. ""China will dramatically increase in importance,"" Stark said referring to the raft of suppliers that Mercedes-Benz does business with. China, a market where the luxury passenger car brand sold 674,125 cars last year, is setting the pace in terms of rolling out electric mobility and digital services like mobile phone-based payment systems, giving local suppliers an edge over European and United States competitors, Stark said.""In the area of connectivity services, the Chinese are ahead of the Americans; we have no choice but to deepen our relationship with these suppliers,"" he said, naming China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent as leading players.Daimler is also thinking about a broader alliance on batteries in view of the challenge of trying to police potential ethical or human rights violations in mining of rare earth minerals - such as cobalt, which is often found in conflict zones, but is needed for electric car batteries.""But there are no formal decisions in this area,"" Stark added.Mercedes is also scouting suppliers for innovations to see whether the German carmaker could make use of a more compact, lighter electric vehicle battery.Stark noted that denser, cheaper batteries with shorter recharging times could also allow Mercedes to bring down the cost of electric cars closer to their equivalent combustion-engined variants.""Overall volume and weight are as important as energy density,"" Stark said, referring to battery cells. By bundling orders for components for conventional and electric vehicles with the same supplier, Mercedes-Benz hopes to help its supplier base manage the transition between electric and non-electric cars.Separately, Stark said the replacement of Carlos Ghosn as  Renault  (PA:RENA) chairman will have no impact on an alliance between Renault and Mercedes.""We have a relatively stable cooperation and supply agreement with Renault-Nissan. This supply relationship is stable and will remain unchanged,"" Stark said.Renault on Thursday appointed  Michelin  (PA:MICP) boss Jean-Dominique Senard as its new chairman after Carlos Ghosn was forced to resign in the wake of a financial scandal that has rocked the French carmaker and its partner Nissan.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""It is our compulsory duty to go forward together.""Nissan welcomed the leadership change, which CEO Hiroto Saikawa said would open a ""new chapter"" for the partnership.The announcement also marks a clear end to one of the auto industry's most feted careers, two decades after Ghosn was despatched by former Renault boss Louis Schweitzer to rescue newly acquired Nissan from near-bankruptcy - a feat he pulled off in two years.After 14 years as Renault CEO and a decade as chairman, Ghosn formally resigned from both roles on the eve of the board meeting.Ghosn's arrest and indictment for financial misconduct has strained the Renault-Nissan relationship, threatening the future of the industrial partnership he transformed into a global carmaking giant over two decades.For two months, the tensions deepened as Renault and the French government stuck by Ghosn despite the revelation he had arranged to be paid tens of millions of dollars in additional income, unbeknownst to shareholders.Ghosn has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had agreed to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the Japanese company itself have also been indicted.Both men deny the deferred pay was illegal or required disclosure, while not contesting the agreements' existence. Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.Ghosn had agreed in recent days to step down from Renault, Reuters reported on Tuesday - but only after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected.Senard, who had been due to retire from Michelin in April, now has fences to mend in Japan.Following Ghosn's arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa had sought to weaken Renault's control and resisted its attempts to nominate new directors to the Japanese carmaker's board.In a possible sign of detente on Thursday, Nissan called an April shareholder meeting to appoint a Renault-nominated board member and formally terminate Ghosn and Kelly's directorships. It remains unclear whether Renault, as Nissan's parent, will also name its next chairman.Nissan currently owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent and 34 percent in Mitsubishi Motors, a third major partner in their manufacturing alliance.Once its new management is settled, French officials want the alliance to resume work on a new ownership structure to cement the partnership - which Ghosn had been mandated to explore when his Renault contract was renewed last year.Nissan is wary of any such moves. Now is not the time to discuss structural changes, Saikawa reiterated on Thursday.""Communication between the boards of the two companies has been a bit difficult"" since Ghosn's arrest, the Nissan CEO said. ""I'm looking forward to better communication.""As Renault CEO, Bollore will also become chairman of the alliance, a French official told Reuters - as set out in the 2002 shareholder pact underpinning the partnership.His operational alliance role will be overseen by Senard, who will lead discussions on the future ""evolution"" of its structure, Renault said. Renault has yet to finalize Ghosn's severance package, estimated by the CGT union at 25-28 million euros ($28-32 million) in addition to an annual pension of 800,000 euros.Ghosn's golden parachute could be politically explosive in France, where the government is battling ""yellow vest"" street protests over low pay and inequality.Fabien Gache, a Renault CGT spokesman, said on Thursday the union would press the government to vote against the package at Renault's annual shareholder meeting in June.""We should not add indecency to indecency,"" Gache said.The government will decide how to vote on Ghosn's severance pay when details become clear, a finance ministry official said.($1 = 0.8814 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in an interview on Monday he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker's ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

32,"Jan 15, 2019 06:42PM ET",France seeks Renault board meeting to replace Ghosn: sources,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The French government is moving to dismiss Renault's (PA:RENA) scandal-hit Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn and has requested a board meeting to consider candidates to replace him, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.France, Renault's biggest shareholder, had until now supported the company's decision to keep Ghosn in office while he awaits trial in Japan for alleged misconduct at Nissan (T:7201), the French carmaker's alliance partner he also chaired until his dismissal in November. But the government, which commands a 15 percent  Renault  stake and two board seats, has asked the company to convene its nominations committee followed by a full board meeting on Jan. 20 to begin the process of appointing one or more successors to Ghosn, according to three people briefed on the process.A spokesman for Renault and a French finance ministry official both said they had no knowledge of plans for a weekend board meeting.Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift firing by Nissan have deepened tensions with Renault, which owns a 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese carmaker.The French move to replace Ghosn follows a decision by the Tokyo District Court earlier on Tuesday to deny the ousted chairman's request for release on bail.Ghosn has been charged over allegations he failed to disclose close to $80 million in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had arranged to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the company itself have also been indicted.Both men deny the deferred pay agreements were illegal or required disclosure, while former alliance boss Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008.Jean-Dominique Senard, who is soon to step down as CEO of tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), is likely to replace Ghosn as Renault chairman, according to two sources.The French state and its advisers are also considering candidates for the Renault CEO role currently occupied on an interim basis by Ghosn's deputy Thierry Bollore.Bollore is among contenders for the permanent CEO appointment. Others under consideration include senior Toyota (T:7203) executive Didier Leroy,  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) boss Philippe Guillemot and one other potential candidate, a source involved in the discussions said.""Philippe Guillemot denies being a candidate for Ghosn's succession,"" said a spokesman for food services group Elior. ""It's possible that people considered him, but no more than that.""Senard could alternatively be appointed chairman and CEO, taking over both of Ghosn's current roles, the source said. ""All these options are on the table.""Leroy declined to comment, and attempts by Reuters to reach Senard at Michelin were unsuccessful. Headhunting firms Korn Ferry and Emeric Lepoutre & Partners, which are involved in the executive search, could not be reached after hours.French officials had said Ghosn should be kept in office unless it became clear he would remain ""incapacitated"" for much longer, also hinting that Tuesday's court decision would be an ""important development"".Two senior French finance ministry officials were traveling to Tokyo on Tuesday for talks with Nissan stakeholders aimed at stabilizing the alliance with Renault, daily Le Figaro reported.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said in a Monday interview he expected Renault to back the Japanese carmaker's ouster of Ghosn when its board of directors were finally given full access to the findings of its internal investigation.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Jan 07, 2019 12:32PM ET",European shares fall as economic growth concerns derail rally,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Monday, after rebounding at the end of last week, as lingering worries about the euro zone economy, Brexit and the U.S. government shutdown offset hopes for a truce between Washington and Beijing over trade.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index closed down 0.15 percent, erasing some of Friday's stellar gains after strong U.S. jobs data and dovish comments from the Federal Reserve chief.Optimism about easing friction between the United States and China had also lifted the mood, helping the index to its biggest daily gain since June 2016.The swift swing into negative territory on Monday morning illustrated the fragility of the gains as other worries returned to the fore.The biggest gainers in Friday's strong rally were some of Monday's laggards, with healthcare (SXDP) and food and beverage stocks (SX3P) falling 0.8 and 1.1 percent respectively. The weaker U.S. dollar also weighed on those companies with large international revenues.Blowout U.S. data and Fed comments had ""calmed some nerves"" and provided some psychological support to the market, said Lars Kreckel, global equity strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. On Friday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank was not on a preset path of interest rate hikes and that it would be sensitive to the downside risks markets were pricing in.""We're not seeing the overheating of the U.S. economy that we were worried about,"" said Kreckel.Still, European equities remain out of favor, particularly after business surveys last week pointed to slower growth. On Friday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's ""Bull & Bear"" gauge of market sentiment had fallen to 1.8, a level the U.S. bank's strategists described as ""extreme bear"" territory that had triggered a ""buy"" signal for equities.Sectors sensitive to the trade tensions were among the few gainers on Monday, with basic resources stocks (SXPP) up 1 percent and technology up 1.5 percent.Chipmakers were also recovering from heavy losses last week after Apple's shock revenue warning. AMS (S:AMS) which supplies the iPhone maker, rose 9.6 percent to the top of the STOXX 600 after announcing a partnership with Chinese software maker Face++ to produce new 3D facial recognition features for smartphones.""Face++ is considered a very solid software platform for 3D sensing and for hardware company like AMS the bottleneck is partly software and the partnership helps them to close this gap,” said Veysel Taze, analyst at ODDO BHF.AMS shares lost almost a quarter of their value on Thursday. Broker research moved other stocks, with Dutch payments firm  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) rising 6.2 percent after BAML upgraded it, while Wirecard (DE:WDIG) was up 2.4 percent after BAML also backed it.On the downside,  Centrica  (L:CNA) fell 4.4 percent after a Jefferies downgrade.A JP Morgan downgrade pushed tyre makers and auto parts makers Pirelli (MI:PIRC),  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and Gestamp (MC:GEST) lower, adding further gloom to the industry knocked by regulation and slowing Chinese sales.The bank said it reckons the European autos are unlikely to re-rate in the first half of the year.Cigarette makers  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) and Imperial Brands (L:IMB) fell 4.2 percent and 5 percent respectively following a downbeat note on the sector from Cowen analysts, who downgraded both stocks to ""market perform"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Nissan in turn controls Mitsubishi via a 34 percent holding.The call for a shareholder meeting will likely be seen as an attempted show of force by Renault's interim management, led by Bollore and Mouna Sepehri, Ghosn's long-standing chief of staff who also heads legal affairs and communications.The letter made no mention of using the shareholder meeting to hire or fire Nissan board members but remained vague about its purpose, saying only that it would ""allow for appropriate disclosure and discussion of governance and other matters"".It added that the indictment of Nissan ""creates significant risks to Renault, as Nissan's largest shareholder, and to the stability of our industrial alliance"".At a Dec. 13 Renault board meeting, directors were briefed on the Nissan investigation that led to Ghosn's arrest. He was charged alongside Nissan this week over the company's failure to declare $43 million in deferred income he had arranged to receive. He and alleged accomplice Greg Kelly remain in custody.While Nissan ousted Ghosn days after his arrest, the Renault board reiterated its earlier decision to keep him in office.

40,"Nov 22, 2018 11:25AM ET","Nissan's Saikawa, a hard-nosed leader, takes center stage after Ghosn's ouster",nan,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Maki ShirakiTOKYO (Reuters) - In sacking his long-time mentor Carlos Ghosn as chairman of Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), CEO Hiroto Saikawa has only bolstered his reputation for being a tough leader unafraid to antagonize people in the interests of business.Thursday's board decision to oust Ghosn, one of the most celebrated leaders in the auto industry, comes after he was arrested in Japan this week, accused by Nissan of serious financial misconduct over many years.Saikawa is described by company insiders as smart, exacting and results-oriented. He will have to marshal those qualities as he tackles reputational loss, legal and regulatory issues, as well as suspicions that the arrest was a coup engineered by board members unhappy with Ghosn and the alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).""He's very strong and aggressive,"" said a Nissan executive, adding Saikawa was not afraid to embarrass people in meetings if their performance fell below his standards.""There are people who love him and people who hate him - people who don't like him because he is very strict,"" said the executive who, like other company insiders Reuters spoke to, declined to be identified due to the personal nature of their comments.Nissan has accused Ghosn of using money for personal purposes and under-reporting income. According to Tokyo prosecutors, Ghosn is suspected of reporting only half of some $88 million in earnings over a five-year period.Reuters was unable to reach Ghosn, who has been detained by Tokyo prosecutors, or a lawyer for him.Saikawa only became CEO last year, having been groomed by Ghosn for the job over many years.Another Nissan executive described Saikawa as unflinchingly scrupulous, adding this would have certainly played into how he dealt with the allegations concerning Ghosn once they surfaced within the company.""He's very much 'by the book'. He has one phone for personal use and one for company use and when he rings his family, he never uses the company phone,"" he said.The executive noted that last year's scandal at the Japanese automaker over improper inspection procedures in the domestic market would have made Saikawa even more cautious.""Saikawa's been dealing with the inspection problem since last year and where matters of compliance are concerned, he'd be of the belief that you just can't turn a blind eye.""Nissan declined to comment on the executives' assessment of Saikawa. Saikawa could not be reached for comment.NOW A GHOSN CRITICAt a news conference on Monday to explain the arrest, Saikawa, usually a very fast talker, earned praised on social media for the unhurried and dispassionate way in which he answered questions for close to 90 minutes, unflanked by lawyers or other company officials.""It was also quite telling how he did not stand and bow in apology,"" said a former Nissan executive, adding it was as if Saikawa was signifying that he personally was not at fault.Saikawa on Monday was also frank in his assessment of Ghosn's shortcomings, saying too much power had been concentrated at the top of the company. In addition to the alleged financial misconduct, there were times where Ghosn made decisions without seeking the input he should have, he added.Saikawa was, however, not his usual composed self at a meeting with department chiefs on Tuesday, according to two people who attended. One said he looked like he ""had tears in his eyes"" and another said his voice quivered at one point.Like everybody else at Nissan and Renault, Saikawa's career has long been overshadowed by Ghosn, the charismatic ""Cost Killer"" credited with turning around a debt-ridden automaker by closing 5 plants and cutting 21,000 jobs - drastic steps that broke new ground in Japan and were widely seen at the time as something only an outsider could do.But now it is Saikawa's turn in uncharted waters.Ghosn had been seen by many analysts as the only person who could make the three-way alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) work.""It's going to be extremely difficult for Saikawa,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama, noting it was not clear if Renault, Nissan's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 percent stake, would be supportive.While Saikawa has served on Renault's board for 10 years, he does not have Ghosn's experience in dealing with the French government or the length of experience Ghosn gained in leading Renault and before that as a senior executive at  Michelin  (PA:MICP).""But he's a tough negotiator. Ghosn wouldn't have picked him as CEO if he wasn't,"" Miyao said.Saikawa, who at 65 is a few months older than Ghosn, joined Nissan from the prestigious Tokyo University more than 40 years ago. Described by some as reluctant to stand out, little is known about his private life, beyond that he is married.He has spent much of his career managing purchasing and supply chains, and helped Ghosn break up Nissan's supplier network to reduce costs. Acting as chief competitive officer from 2013 to 2016, he was tasked with reducing manufacturing costs by saving money in raw material procurement, regulatory expenses and planning and development. Saikawa was also instrumental in hammering out the details of Nissan's deal to bring Mitsubishi Motors into the alliance.""He's very much a numbers man - he's hard on those that don't deliver results, although he's also hard on himself,"" said the former Nissan executive. ""Some might say that he lacks warmth.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

41,"Nov 20, 2018 07:20PM ET",These Are the Key Players in Carlos Ghosn's Downfall,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. has made shocking allegations against its longtime leader Carlos Ghosn, accusing him of understating his compensation in securities filings and using company assets for personal use.The alleged misconduct has thrown an almost 20-year-old alliance between Nissan and France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) into chaos.Here’s a look at the cast of characters involved:Carlos GhosnRole: Chairman of Nissan, Renault, Mitsubishi Motors and their three-way alliance; chief executive officer of RenaultWhy he matters: The 64-year-old has been the glue binding together three automakers that were highly troubled before he took command starting in the 1990s. Ghosn relinquished the Nissan CEO role last year and had been trying to structure the alliance so that it was “irreversible,” potentially through an outright merger.What he has said: Attempts to reach Ghosn and his representatives for comment since the news of his arrest emerged Monday have been unsuccessful. In an interview last year, he said he might remain a boardroom fixture as long as Ferdinand Piech, who was chairman of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG into his late 70s. “I am not just shutting the door and going fishing or something,” Ghosn said.Greg KellyRole: Senior vice president of talent management for the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance and a Nissan directorWhy he matters: Kelly became the first American to serve on Nissan’s board in 2012, having risen through the ranks of the company’s human-resources operations. CEO Hiroto Saikawa on Monday described Kelly and Ghosn as the “masterminds” behind years of alleged misconduct.What he has said: As with Ghosn, nobody has seen or heard from Kelly or those representing him since his arrest. Unlike his oft-quoted and highly visible boss, he’s flown under the radar during the course of his 30-year career.Hiroto SaikawaRole: CEO of NissanWhy he matters: A lifer who joined Nissan a month after graduating from Tokyo University in 1977, Saikawa became a Ghosn protege and served in key roles spanning the globe, including purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing and research and development. He publicly bristled at reports that Ghosn was pursuing a potential Renault-Nissan merger, saying there was no merit to combining the companies and emphasizing the need to preserve autonomy.What he has said: During a press conference late Monday in Yokohama, Saikawa credited Ghosn with implementing reforms Nissan couldn’t have achieved on its own. But that was about the extent of the positive things he had to say about his longtime boss. “Beyond being sorry, I feel great disappointment, frustration, despair, indignation and resentment,” Saikawa said. “This is the negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn.”Thierry BolloreRole: Chief operating officer and temporary deputy CEO of RenaultWhy he matters: Ghosn hinted to French lawmakers in January that he would eventually hand off the day-to-day responsibility of running Renault, spurring months of speculation about his successor. He ended up agreeing to stay on as both chairman and CEO for another four years, but the company elevated Bollore to second-in-command. The 55-year-old French national started his career at tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and joined Renault in 2012.What he has said: In a letter to employees sent late Monday, Bollore expressed “full support” for Ghosn, while pledging to protect the partnership with the Japanese automakers.Philippe LagayetteRole: Lead independent director of Renault; chaired the board’s meeting late TuesdayWhy he matters: The 75-year-old chairman of French consultant and advisory firm PL Conseils has been on Renault’s board since 2007. He leads the audit, risk and ethics committee and is a member of the compensation committee. Renault appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach to dealing with Ghosn thus far, but these are the committees’ whose patience will be tested -- especially if French politicians are less forgiving.What he has said: While Lagayette himself hasn’t spoken up, Renault’s board issued a statement saying it’s unable to comment on the evidence gathered against Ghosn by Nissan and Japanese authorities. The board also asked Nissan to share all the information it’s come up with in its investigation.Hiroshige SekoRole: Japan’s minister of economy, trade and industryWhy he matters: Seko already had a lot on his plate, including automotive trade frictions with U.S. President Donald Trump. The last thing he needed was a potentially catastrophic rupture involving one of Japan’s leading manufacturers.What he has said: Seko said Monday that Ghosn’s situation is regrettable and emphasized the importance of the alliance remaining stable. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also threw his support behind the alliance in a meeting with Hitoshi Kawaguchi, Nissan’s executive in charge of government affairs.Bruno Le MaireRole: France’s Finance MinisterWhy he matters: The French state has balked at Ghosn’s compensation packages in recent years, and he bowed to the pushback in February, accepting a 30 percent cut when his tenure was extended. But Le Maire has been hands-off in the wake of Ghosn’s arrest, saying the government wouldn’t demand his dismissal without evidence. He said the alliance has been weakened and France’s priority is to act quickly to preserve it.What he has said: In a joint statement Tuesday, Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart Seko expressed their “shared wish to maintain this winning cooperation,” calling the alliance “one of the greatest symbols of Franco-Japanese industrial cooperation.”"
42,"Nov 19, 2018 12:19PM ET",Nissan to oust Ghosn after arrest for alleged financial misconduct,nan,"By Ritsuko Ando and Maki ShirakiYOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) Chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested on Monday for alleged financial misconduct and will be fired from the board this week, a dramatic fall for a leader hailed for rescuing the Japanese carmaker from close to bankruptcy.Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Nissan's French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) and his departure will raise questions about the future of the alliance.Nissan said an internal investigation, triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower, had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting for years how much he was earning.Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the best known figures in the global car industry and a rare foreign executive who enjoyed corporate superstar status in Japan for reviving the ailing Japanese brand. ""The problem of governance was significant,"" Saikawa said, confirming the arrest of Ghosn in Japan. ""Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications."" Saikawa, a long-standing lieutenant to Ghosn, said he could not give specifics on the personal use of company money but that the wrongdoing was serious and had gone on for years. Ghosn could not be reached for comment. ""To have so greatly violated the trust of many, I feel full of disappointment and regret,"" Saikawa told a late night news conference. ""It's not just disappointment, but a stronger feeling of outrage, and for me, despondency.""Saikawa took over as Nissan CEO from Ghosn last year. Ghosn once told reporters the two thought alike. Saikawa said he would propose at a board meeting on Thursday to remove Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also accused of financial misconduct. Kelly could also not be reached for comment. Renault shares tumbled 11 percent in Paris to be among the worst performing stocks in Europe (STOXX). Nissan's German-listed securities (TG:7201) dropped 10 percent. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government, Renault's top shareholder, would safeguard the long-term viability of the carmaker.""The key question for us is to ensure the stability of Renault and of the alliance between Renault and Nissan, so I am working on that with all the parties,"" he told reporters in Brussels after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.GOVERNANCE Known as ""Le Cost Killer"" for overseeing turnarounds that included cuts, Ghosn has remained popular in Japan despite pushing through massive job losses and recent controversy over his pay.Japanese media said Ghosn had reported about 10 billion yen ($88.9 million) of annual compensation as about 5 billion yen for several years.Ousting Ghosn, 64, is bound to raise questions about an alliance that he personally shaped and had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership.""It is hard not to conclude that there may be a gulf opening up between Renault and Nissan,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton, raising the prospect of a potential ""re-Japanization"" of Nissan and the end of the alliance.Citi analyst Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary said the share price reaction showed how important Ghosn was to the partnership, adding that the alliance had long undervalued Nissan shares held indirectly by Renault investors.""Ghosn is viewed as critical for value unlock,"" he added.Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Since 2016 Nissan has held a 34 percent controlling stake in its smaller Japanese rival, Mitsubishi.A statement from Mitsubishi said it would propose removing Ghosn from its board.Monday's news is likely to raise questions about Nissan's accountability at a time when Japan has been pushing companies for better governance. Recent cases of corporate malfeasance have hit companies including accounting irregularities at Toshiba Corp (T:6502) and data falsification and improper inspections by manufacturers including Nissan. The Asahi newspaper reported on its website that prosecutors had begun searching the offices of Nissan's headquarters and other locations on Monday evening.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Ghosn began his career at  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France, moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its CEO in 2001. Ghosn remained in that post until last year. In June Renault shareholders approved Ghosn's 7.4 million euro ($8.5 million) pay package for 2017. In addition to this, he received 9.2 million euros in his final year as Nissan chief executive.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

43,"Nov 15, 2018 11:54AM ET","Cheap stocks back in vogue, even if laced with 'value traps'",nan,"By Danilo Masoni and Josephine MasonMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - With world equity markets set to call time on one of the longest bull markets in history, so-called 'value stocks' - wallflowers during the technology-led boom years - are suddenly back in fashion. European value stocks, defined generally as firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their current share price, have outperformed growth stocks since early October as a dramatic sell-off swept across global equity markets unnerved by gradual end of a decade of easy money and rising trade tensions.Companies that boast a faster pace of growth like the big U.S. tech names or Europe's luxury giants have been particularly favored during the past decade of central bank largesse.In contrast, the so-called value end of the market has become cheaper and cheaper, creating some opportunities.Heading into 2019, investors in search of better returns are scanning stocks in beaten-down sectors like banks, builders, autos or telecoms, looking whether cash flows reflect poorly in shares prices or whether other valuation metrics have fallen below historical averages or are disconnected from the sector.""After ten tough years, it's finally getting interesting,"" said Luiz Sauerbronn at U.S.-based Brandes Investment Partners.""It has all been about technology and the high-flying growth stuff. In the last decade, value has only outperformed a couple of years in Europe, and October has been much better,"" added Sauerbronn, who helps manage nearly $28 billion.In October when world stocks lost $7 trillion of market cap at one point, European value stocks  fell only 4.3 percent while the region's growth stocks  suffered their worst month since August 2015, down 6.5 percent.The outperformance has continued so far in November.Still from the 2009 lows, European growth has risen 150 percent, against a rise of 100 percent for value.Last week, the Fed signaled it was still on course to increase rates next month.""The growth stocks benefited tremendously from having zero rates. That's the status quo forever? I hope not, and I don't think it will be the case,"" Sauerbronn also said.GRAPHIC: Value outperforms since early October - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QsVqJwAVOIDING VALUE TRAPS Buying value, however, is easier said than done, with the main challenge for investors being avoiding the so-called value traps, companies whose share price are cheap for a good reason.""Value investing relies on a handful of stocks that go on to deliver high returns,"" Bernstein strategists said this month.""Investing in the entire Value portfolio is not only impractical for most active investors, but is also subject to a massive return drag from the losers,"" they added.Among their value picks they singled out several European companies in sectors such as mining, oil, airlines, construction and retail:  Anglo American  (L:AAL),  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), LafargeHolcim (S:LHN), and Ahold-Delhaize (AS:AD).Sauerbronn said that battered tobacco stocks also looked attractive now and that he was increasing exposure to the sector.One feature of value stocks is that their valuations have generally fallen below historical averages, whereas growth stocks trade above in a gap that has been widening ever since 2008. Easy monetary policies and the growing success of passive investing has just amplified this spread. Among miners, Anglo American, for example, is traded at around 0.5 times its cash flow, against a historical average of nearly 0.7 times, while peer  Glencore  (L:GLEN) is traded at 0.5 times vs more than 0.7 times. In banks, Italian lender UniCredit (MI:CRDI) prices at around 0.5 times its book value, a 28 percent discount to euro zone banks, while French cement maker Lafarge  Holcim  is trading at its lowest PE multiple since 2011 and builder Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) at its lowest in nearly a decade. ""Today there is very apparent value staring you in the face in certain parts of the market. Does that mean that those stocks go up tomorrow? Probably not,"" said Mark Breedon, who manages a 1.8 billion fund of global equities for Investec in Hong Kong.""The question is getting the timing right. What you need is to start seeing those companies beating expectations or getting some technical momentum behind them as you never want to try catching a falling knife,"" he added.According to Breedon, the most interesting opportunities can be found outside the main benchmarks, whose constituents have been lifted indiscriminately by the big flows provided by passive investing. Most stocks with a market cap above $1 billion are traded outside the dominant benchmarks, he said.GRAPHIC: Growth vs Value over 10 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QuNDuUSTART OF A TREND?Even though it is too early to call the start of the trend in favor of value stocks, this market segment is increasingly becoming a hunting ground for investors.Chris Hiorns, portfolio manager of the EdenTree Amity European Fund with just under 100 million pounds in assets under management and a long-time value bull, believes the recent shift in the market has been a move away from growth rather than a reallocation into value.Hiorns still sees chances for further outperformance and has recently increased exposure to cheaply valued stocks such as tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), construction company Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB), staffing firm  Randstad  (AS:RAND), as well as banks ING (AS:INGA) and Santander (MC:SAN).""The market is still very growth-oriented, but there's lots of capacity for value to outperform this year and into next year,"" he said. ""Value bias is the place to be at the moment.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

45,"Nov 12, 2018 02:10AM ET",Disappointing third-quarter earnings another blow to battered European market,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European companies are delivering their most disappointing earnings in nearly three years as a sluggish economy and rising costs take their toll on bottom lines, dealing another blow to investor confidence shaken by Italy's budget crisis and Brexit.Stocks have seen sharp swings on results days as firms reveal the damage wrought by higher trade tariffs and weaker global demand against a backdrop of sliding equity markets and rising volatility.Some of Europe's biggest companies, from cement makers and car manufacturers to engineering firms and airlines, warned of weaker margins.""Macro momentum did roll over more than people had anticipated and I think that is coming through in the (earnings) numbers,"" said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. The rate of earnings beats so far this earnings season is its weakest since the fourth quarter 2015 results, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows.Many investors had hoped a solid corporate earnings season would help offset a slew of political and macro economic challenges across the region from Rome's budget crisis to London's struggle to clinch a Brexit deal. The STOXX 600 is on track for its worst year since 2011. But analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the STOXX 600 at their fastest pace since July 2016. Downgrades started well before the earnings season even started three weeks ago, suggesting that confidence was already low. ""The biggest reason why the Q3 earnings season has felt weaker than usual is the absence of very good results rather than significantly more big misses than usual,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts.Earnings on the STOXX 600 are expected to grow 15.8 percent in the third quarter year-on-year, and are on track for 8.4 percent earnings growth for the full year 2018. That compares to earnings growth of 12.2 percent for 2017. But this season companies have also struggled with higher costs: raw materials, fuel prices and wages have all climbed while trade tariffs piled extra inflationary pressure onto some firms.Examples abound.The world's largest cement maker LafargeHolcim (S:LHN) cut its profit expectations due to rising fuel and transport costs.Slowing growth and higher costs hurt autos in particular, with European companies reliant on growth in China, the world's top car market.Carmakers including  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) had cut profit outlooks ahead of results due to trade tariffs and slowing Chinese demand.But negative surprises during this season then came from their suppliers, the auto parts manufacturers including  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Nokian , and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), also suffering from weaker sales growth.SHARP SHARE REACTIONSVolatility in equity markets globally is shifting up a gear and a sharp worldwide sell-off right at the start of the earnings season certainly didn't help sentiment.Outsized share moves continued into this quarter, with a distinct negative skew to investors' reactions to companies delivering disappointing earnings while in-line or modestly positive results have not been rewarded in kind.On Thursday, shares in ProSiebensat (DE:PSMGn) sank 15 percent to its lowest in more than six years after the German broadcaster said it would pay out less of its earnings to shareholdersMeanwhile  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) shares the same day rose just 0.7 percent even after the German engineering company's results beat expectations.Stocks that missed consensus EPS estimates have seen the worst performance of the last four quarters, according to UBS. Earnings-day moves in Europe are averaging +/- 4 percent, against the typical average of +/- 3.1 percent since 2003, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said.LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL?Despite underwhelming earnings this season, some investors see the seeds of a recovery for Europe into the year-end and next year - partly off the back of a pullback in U.S. stocks which investors piled into this year.Quarterly earnings growth is expected to be stronger in Europe than the United States next year, putting the region back on the radar for investors hungry for growth.""When one looks at long-term charts and relative outperformance of the U.S. versus Europe and profit margins, you would say on a five-year view you would expect these to begin to converge,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.""The necessary triggers you'd have to see are PMI figures picking back up and signs the Italy-Brussels negotiations are at least in a steady state as opposed to going haywire,"" he added.If trade war concerns have peaked and the United States and China arrive at a compromise, the euro area economy highly geared to global trade may get a boost, and inflows could follow.""Expectations are so low on European growth that it could just surprise next year,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.""The outlook for next year in terms of fund flows is much more exciting in world ex-US than it is in US,"" he added, saying he favors emerging markets and Europe.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

49,"Oct 22, 2018 05:40AM ET",Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,nan,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.1/SEVEN DEADLY…The real possibility of the yuan weakening to the 7-per-dollar mark last seen in 2008, hangs over China, emerging markets and global equities. The thinking so far has been that the risk of capital outflows, along the lines of what happened in 2016, would dissuade Beijing from allowing such a slide in the currency. But more recently, weak benchmark yuan/dollar fixings, a drop in the trade-weighted yuan index to below 2017 lows, and a flurry of comments and measures from policymakers reveal both a sense of panic and determination to prop up the economy.With third-quarter economic growth slowing to crisis-era lows, no let-up in Washington's trade rhetoric and a stock market that's lost 28 percent since February, China has been forced to ease monetary conditions and is cajoling banks to lend to small firms. It has just announced tax cuts that could reach one percent of GDP next year.A weaker yuan would complement those efforts. Yet a 7-per-dollar yuan would erode faith in the China's stability and provoke more U.S. ire. And coming on top of rising U.S. yields, Brexit and Italian politics, it would add another layer of worry to world markets.  Lost in transmission: China's small firms get more loans on paper but not in reality –China central bank chief says plenty of room for monetary adjustments amid trade row -China's tax cuts next year expected to reach 1 pct of GDP China's policymakers pledge market support - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OyNcCL2/EUROPE'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE Stock market turmoil, conflict over a contentious Italian budget, high oil prices, sputtering economic growth -- not quite the backdrop a central bank wants to see three months before its it ends its stimulus program. But that is exactly what the European Central Bank faces when it meets on Thursday. For now, the heightened risks to the growth outlook are not expected to derail its plans to end QE by year-end, but the bank could downgrade the growth risk assessment in its policy statement.That would be a dovish signal and one likely to cheer euro zone bond markets which have been guided already to not expect a rise in the ECB's record low rates until well into 2019. No wonder then, that the gap between short-dated bond yields in the United States and Germany are at their widest in 30 years, while 10-year euro area bond yields (with the exception of Italy) have been largely insulated from the recent spike U.S. Treasury yields.

With rising borrowing costs and prices outstripping wage growth, the market has been a weak spot in the robust economy. So new homes sales data, due on Oct. 24, will be closely scrutinized. U.S. homebuilding dropped more than expected in September, while mortgage activity was knocked in the latest week to its lowest since 2014.

On Friday, S&P Global is likely to do the same, premising the move on Italian plans to boost spending to boost growth and the impact on a debt ratio that's already one of the world's worst.But Italy's debt is trading with yields that suggest investors are pricing it as junk already. So the bigger risk than a one-notch ratings downgrade has been that one or both of the agencies set the outlook on Italy's rating to Negative, instead of Stable. That would suggest a fall into junk is a real possibility in the near future.Loss of investment grade carries a high cost -- hundreds of billions of euros in fund flows and possibly even a fresh euro zone crisis.Luckily for Italy, Moody's has held off doing that, maintaining a steady outlook on the credit and providing a boost to bonds and stocks.

51,"Oct 19, 2018 12:01PM ET",Daimler's diesel troubles trigger new profit warning,nan,"By Edward TaylorFRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) said its operating profit would fall by over 10 percent this year, its second earnings warning since June, blaming ""government proceedings and measures in various regions"" as a crackdown on diesel emissions takes a toll.Daimler warned investors it expected its full-year earnings before interest and tax to be ""significantly below"" last year's level. Earnings at Mercedes-Benz Cars, its main contributor, will likewise fall ""significantly below"" the prior-year level.Analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note that the profit warning was not triggered by a slowdown in business, since demand for Mercedes-Benz cars remains high, but was caused by one-off factors such as regulatory and court rulings.The company did not gives details on what was behind the latest warning in a statement rushed out ahead of the scheduled release of quarterly earnings next week. A hit of up to 400 million euros ($460 million) was related to government proceedings into diesel and a European Court of Justice ruling around Mercedes' use of banned cooling agent R134a, analysts at Evercore ISI said.The Stuttgart-based owner of Mercedes-Benz is being investigated for its diesel emissions in Europe and the United States, and last month announced Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche would step down in 2019 to become chairman from 2021.The company's shares fell to a five-year low on the news, dragging other European auto stocks lower, before paring some of the losses. The European auto sector index (SXAP) fell 3.8 percent to a two-year low.The warning from Daimler came after economic growth in China, a major market for carmakers, slowed to its weakest quarterly pace since 2009.Adding to concerns about the broader sector, Swedish truckmaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) forecast slower demand for trucks in Europe and China next year, while French tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) cut its full-year market forecasts on Thursday.RUSH RELEASEDaimler rushed out the release of third-quarter earnings figures that fell well short of market expectations.The profit warning comes amid friction between the German government and carmakers over who pays for expensive retrofits of new exhaust systems for polluting older vehicles, and an ongoing probe by U.S. authorities into emissions. In May, German prosecutors searched Daimler offices as part of a fraud probe related into possible manipulation of exhaust-gas after-treatment in diesel cars. A spokesman for the Stuttgart prosecutor's office on Friday said there was ""nothing new"" to say about this investigation, which is ongoing.In February 2016 the United States Environmental Protection Agency asked Mercedes-Benz to explain emissions levels in some of its diesel cars.The Stuttgart-based company also reported lower unit sales from its vans division due to delivery delays; and the need to recognize costs related to a European Court of Justice ruling on vehicles using an old coolant.Daimler said its third-quarter earnings before interest amounted to 2.49 billion euros ($2.85 billion), down 27 percent from 3.41 billion in the year-earlier period due to a 35 percent EBIT fall at Mercedes-Benz Cars to 1.37 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Italy's bank stocks index (FTIT8300) fell 2.9 percent to a 22-month low as government bonds were sold off. It was set for its fourth straight week of declines.A crop of results, some with negative outlooks, suggested growth slowing in China, car demand falling, and issues in the construction sector.""Companies that disappoint are always more harshly punished but, given the trend in the market currently, reactions are stronger than usual,"" said Emmanuel Cau, European equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). Shares in tire maker Michelin (PA:MICP) tumbled 6.7 percent after it cut its sales outlook and downgraded its market growth forecasts, blaming slowing Chinese car demand and new emissions testing regulations.Its German rival Continental (DE:CONG) fell 3 percent to the bottom of the DAX, and the autos and parts sector as a whole (SXAP) sank 2.9 percent. ""This warning provides a negative read across to all tire makers (weaker market volume and higher input costs),"" said UBS analysts.CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS French conglomerate Bouygues (PA:BOUY) fell 6.5 percent after cutting its profit outlook due to difficulties in its construction businesses, also reporting a shrinking margin due to problems with contracts and France's rail strikes.""This was particularly surprising two weeks after a bullish construction capital markets day,"" wrote  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts.British construction equipment rental firm Ashtead (L:AHT) fell 4.5 percent in sympathy.Swedish builder Skanska (ST:SKAb) fell 9 percent after saying it had booked charges of 1.3 billion crowns ($140 million) in the third quarter relating to construction projects in the United States.Overall, the construction and materials sector (SXOP) fell 0.3 percent, its second day of declines after being hit on Thursday by a profit warning from Heidelbergcement.""We have a negative view on this sector - it's very sensitive to emerging markets and China, and we're quite cautious on those areas,"" said Barclays' Cau. ""Construction is penalized both by a slowing economy and by rising raw materials costs.""Sopra Steria (PA:SOPR) was the top STOXX 600 faller, dropping 26 percent after cutting its 2018 revenue forecast due to a contract loss in banking software. ""The profit warning will probably trigger around 15 percent EPS downgrades and obviously a bit of an additional hit from a share price perspective because of derating as well,"" said Georgios Kertsos, an analyst at Berenberg.""It's probably a bit too harsh a hit,"" he added, saying more detail was needed from the company, which is in a quiet period before its third-quarter results on Oct. 25.Overall, analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for European earnings quite sharply in recent weeks, but Barclays' Cau said he thought estimates for 2019 earnings growth were still too high and could decline further.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It had previously pledged to increase sales in line with more robust market growth expectations, in guidance reiterated on Sept. 13.The fallout from slowing car- and truck-tyre demand in China and a European auto registrations slump linked to tougher new emissions tests has proven worse than expected, Chief Finance Officer Marc Henry told reporters on a call. ""All of these markets are going to be in decline by comparison with the forecasts we had made,"" he said.The company posted a 5.2 percent increase in third-quarter revenue to 5.62 billion euros ($6.44 billion) as it reported sales four days earlier than planned.But tire sales to carmakers fell 5 percent in China and Western Europe - where the tougher new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) has led to model approval delays and withdrawals.Michelin, which had earlier pledged to increase 2018 recurring operating profit, said its growth would amount to at least 200 million euros before exchange-rate effects.But it slashed 2018 market growth forecasts to 0.5 percent for car tires, instead of the previously forecast 1.5 percent; and to a 1.5 percent decline in truck tires rather than a 0.5 percent expansion.Truck tire demand is expected to shrink by 5-6 percent in the fourth quarter, Henry said, without giving any explanation for the earlier-than-scheduled results publication.The company nevertheless reiterated its 2018 target of 1.1 billion euros in positive structural free cash flow goal.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Autos shares (SXAP) rose 1.5 percent and mining shares (SXPP) climbed 0.7 percent after U.S. officials invited China to new trade talks, which the Chinese foreign ministry welcomed.The two sectors have been the biggest victims of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners. ""You have to be concerned about the impact [of trade tensions on autos] because the evidence is that companies are seeing pressures as a consequence,"" said Steven Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management.""But the share prices appear to be discounting a negative scenario already,"" added Magill, who holds Peugeot in his European portfolio. Tech (SX8P) was also a top boost, up 0.9 percent as chipmakers and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers ams (S:AMS), Infineon (DE:IFXGn), BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI), and STMicro (MI:STM) climbed 2.3 to 3.5 percent after Apple launched bigger and pricier iPhones.Dealmaking and results led to some strong stock moves.French bank  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) gained 4.2 percent after it decided to sell several specialized finance businesses to its parent, BPCE, and use part of the 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in proceeds for acquisitions.

Recent reports have suggested mergers between the two German lenders, as well as possible deals involving Italian and French banks, but banks remain the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date.""Despite all the recent rumours around UniCredit and other European banks, cross-border banking M&A will be limited, if any, in the foreseeable future,"" said Jauke de Jong, equity analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam.Oil storage and distribution firm  Rubis  (PA:RUBF) fell as much as 14 percent, recovering to trade down 6.4 percent by mid-morning, after issues with its Iran and Turkey operations bruised first-half profit.U.S. sanctions against Iran forced Rubis to find a buyer for a recent acquisition in Iran, leading to a 15 million euro writeoff, while the firm's oil storage facility in Ceyhan, Turkey, also underperformed due to political tensions there, Berenberg analysts said. German meal delivery firm Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) also suffered a 5.8 percent drop after its first-half results. [nL5N1VZ0PV]French tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) rose 3.1 percent after it confirmed its 2018 financial outlook, saying signs of growth in Europe and North America would offset a slowdown in China. Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) shares fell 9.8 percent after the company placed 2.46 billion shares.Investors were awaiting decisions from the ECB and the BoE, as well as a Central Bank of Turkey meeting, later in the session.Neither the ECB nor the BoE was expected to hike interest rates, but the market would hone in on any comments on the pace of the ECB's planned halving of its asset purchase programme, and from BoE policymakers on the Brexit process.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""Corrections and turbulence in recent months and weeks have been fairly localized in both space and time.""Strong earnings growth is part of what is preserving the market.

The stock is down 22 percent since July 31, when it suspended a director, halting dealing in some bond funds soon afterwards.Austria's Raiffeisen Bank (VI:RBIV), which operates across eastern Europe and has been in the firing line as new U.S. sanctions on Russia develop, fell 2.5 percent. Shares in Danish medical equipment, supplies and distribution company Ambu (CO:AMBUb) recovered swiftly from a 10 percent drop at the open after its third-quarter results missed analysts' targets. Swiss telecoms group Sunrise Communications (S:SRCG) rose 6.5 percent after it increased its guidance for full-year 2018 EBITDA.Building materials firm CRH (I:CRH) pared early gains to trade up just 1.1 percent after reporting first-half margins held steady and striking a positive tone for earnings in the second half of the year. Some analysts pointed to weaker cash flow.

He steadily expanded his fame, branching out from being one of Paris's most recognised three-star chefs to become a worldwide phenomenon.In France, Robuchon is regarded as a chef who ushered in an era of authenticity after the restraint of nouvelle cuisine.""The older I get, the more I realize the truth is: the simpler the food, the more exceptional it can be,"" he told Business Insider in an interview in 2014.""I never try to marry more than three flavours in one dish. I like walking into a kitchen and knowing that the dishes are identifiable and the ingredients within them easy to detect.""Born in Poitiers, western France, in 1945, Robuchon rose quickly through apprenticeships, learning techniques from around the country, before taking over as head chef of what was then the Hotel Concorde La Fayette in Paris at the age of 29.The son of a builder, his brand eventually became a business in itself and he opened restaurants from Las Vegas to Shanghai, Bangkok, Macau, Tokyo and New York. ""What he is leaving us is immense,"" three-starred chef Eric Frechon said on Twitter. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux called Robuchon a ""visionary"" who boosted French cuisine's reputation worldwide.Robuchon, whose restaurants charged more than $400 per person for the tasting menu, said he was ""a regular person"" when it came to cooking for himself.""I do (things) as simple as I can. Steak and french fries, nice and French. I really do love eggs as well. I make quite a lot of omelettes, salads,"" he told Business Insider.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

66,"Jul 23, 2018 08:30AM ET",Further FAANG Disappointments Could Be Detrimental: Taking Stock,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- The last five days have provided plenty of fodder for the bulls, as my colleague on the Markets Live blog Andrew Cinko pointed out on a post titled ""What We Learned This Week Is Stocks Are Still in a Bull Market.""It’s early, but the consistency of earnings beats have been nothing short of spectacular -- as of last week, 95% of the 86 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results topped EPS expectations -- JPM points out that out of the results so far, the stock reaction to the beats is the best in two years while we’re also seeing the second best quarterly guidance outlook in five years (67% of companies have revised earnings forecasts higher).Not to mention the relative strength in the financials (BKX banks index finished the week up 2.3% vs a flat S&P 500) and the fact that the cash index keeps holding its ground at the 2,800 mark, which has served as resistance for months -- so far the futures are off lows and pointing to an open just a few handles below 2,800.But the resistance-becomes-support theory could start to look even clearer if the market continues to zone in on earnings, guidance and long-term fundamentals and shrug off the most recent bout of trade discord (Trump’s $500b tariff threat), geopolitical browbeating (Trump’s fuming all-caps tweet against Iran’s Rouhani) and the jitters over a currency war breaking out (Mnuchin attempted to assuage those concerns over the weekend). If the earnings continue to come in anywhere close to what we’ve seen so far -- and no major bellwether utters the words ""high-water mark"" or ""peak cycle"" -- and the more macro noise gets drowned out, then the stage would likely be set for a prolonged rally that would ultimately test January’s closing record of 2,873.Further FAANG Disappointments Could HurtBut one area where I think the market needs cooperation from, in this scenario, is the momentum trade. I’m not so sure the tape can withstand further disappointments in the FAANG complex (key metrics underwhelming sell-side models and buy-side whispers, worrisome capex commentary, etc.) after what we just saw happen to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares, which dropped almost 10% since last Monday’s results to notch its worst week in over two years.This is partly because these long trades are crowded by so many hedge funds, partly because the sell-side is beyond one-sided in their recommendations for the group -- the FAANG stocks collectively have 182 buy ratings versus 7 sells -- and partly because the topic of FAANG frothiness has been brought up more and more lately.If any of the three FAANGs due to report this week (Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tonight, see our preview; Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Wednesday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Thursday) react poorly after their results, or if Netflix starts to really spiral downward, or if other momentum names begin to show weakness (like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) -3.7% pre-market after this Wall Street Journal article over the weekend: ""Tesla Asks Suppliers for Cash Back to Help Turn a Profit""), then that frothiness could quickly turn to a pain that has the potential to kneecap the odds of a continuation rally in the broader market.Semis, Hospitals, and the Toy StocksNetflix Bull vs Bear Event - Today 12pm ETA reminder that I’ll be moderating a Netflix Bull vs Bear Q&A on the Top Live blog Monday.

68,"Jul 18, 2018 05:10PM ET","U.S. tariffs may raise cost of insurance, parts, drive up auto thefts",nan,"By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A threat by the U.S. government to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported auto parts could hit consumers in unexpected ways: higher repair costs, insurance premiums and even the theft of more cars for their parts, the industry said. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has launched an investigation into whether auto imports pose a national security threat and threatened to slap the tariffs on cars from the European Union and elsewhere. A coalition of auto insurance groups said in previously unreported comments that hiking tariffs on imported auto parts by 25 percent could increase costs by 2.7 percent, or $3.4 billion annually, for personal auto insurance premiums. The U.S. Commerce Department will hold a hearing about the matter on Thursday.Consumers will bear virtually all the higher repair costs, said the American Insurance Association, National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies and Property Casualty Insurers Association of America in comments jointly submitted to the Commerce Department. ""The imposition of tariffs could likely lead to the filing of hundreds, if not thousands, of requests for rate increases by insurers with insurance regulators across all fifty states,"" the groups said.Insurers said they might not be able to quickly get replacement parts for policyholders, ""resulting in delays and increased costs.""""Motor vehicle theft rates could well rise, as many stolen vehicles are sold for their parts,"" the groups added. A Commerce Department spokesman did not comment Wednesday on the industry statements, but said the agency would send a report to the White House after ""collecting all the facts, and completing a careful analysis.""""While we aim to complete the investigation and report to the President within a couple months, no proposal for action has yet been made,"" the department said. In separate comments to the Commerce Department, the Auto Care Association, which represents 150,000 manufacturers, distributors and sellers of motor vehicle parts and related goods, that its economic study estimated that the cost of car ownership would increase by more than $700 per year per household should the tariffs be imposed. Top executives of  Michelin  (PA:MICP) North America, Cooper Tire & Rubber (N:CTB), Sumitomo Rubber Industries (T:5110) said in a joint letter to the Commerce Department that rising costs for auto parts makes consumers ""wait longer before making a new car purchase or maintaining the safety of their vehicle."" ""We are concerned that consumers waiting longer to replace their tires will result in increased traffic accidents and fatalities,"" they said.Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research, said the tariffs will boost maintenance costs, since many parts regularly used for vehicles largely made overseas like air filters and water pumps.""The costs of maintaining a car is going to go up as is fixing or insuring it,"" Dziczek said. ""But those costs are not going to go up as much as buying a new car"" with added tariff costs. Separately, a coalition of seven auto industry trade groups representing nearly every major automaker, auto dealers and parts companies said in a letter to Trump on Tuesday that the tariffs will be a ""massive tax"" on consumers, leading to ""increasing vehicle service and repair costs that may result in consumers delaying critical vehicle maintenance.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

80,"May 21, 2018 05:43PM ET",Tesla Model 3 fails to get Consumer Reports nod due to 'big flaws',nan,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Sonam Rai(Reuters) - Influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports will not recommend Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Model 3 sedan, saying on Monday it braked slower than a full-sized pickup truck, taking the shine off a day of gains for shares in Elon Musk's electric car company. Musk had driven shares in Tesla as much as 4 percent higher with weekend tweets showing the Silicon Valley company was aiming initially to deliver higher-priced, more profitable fully-loaded editions of the Model 3. The car is seen as crucial to Tesla's profitability at a time when it is battling to reverse production shortfalls, confronting reports of crashes involving its vehicles and facing increased skepticism over its finances. On Twitter, Musk said the fully-loaded Model 3, with all-wheel drive, a dual motor and a 310-mile (499-km) range - but excluding its vaunted Autopilot feature - would cost $78,000. The company has not yet begun to make the $35,000 base price version that Tesla originally claimed would make it a mass-market vehicle.Consumer Reports, however, declined to recommend the Model 3 and criticized it for having overly long stopping distances and a difficult-to-use center touchscreen.The magazine, which provides an annual rating of vehicles sold in the United States, said even though its tests found plenty to like about the Model 3 and it was a thrill to drive, it had ""big flaws.""Tesla's stopping distance of 152 feet (46 m) when braking at 60 miles per hour (100 km per hour) was ""far worse"" than any contemporary car tested by the magazine and about seven feet longer than the stopping distance of a Ford (N:F) F-150 full-sized pickup, it said.Tesla said its own testing had found braking distances of 133 feet on average using the 18""  Michelin  (PA:MICP) all season tire, and as low as 126 feet with all tires currently available.""Unlike other vehicles, Tesla is uniquely positioned to address more corner cases over time through over-the-air software updates, and it continually does so to improve factors such as stopping distance,"" Tesla said.""LOSE MONEY AND DIE""Research firm Berenberg also helped give Tesla shares a boost on Monday, after it raised its share price target to $500 from $470 on Friday.Its forecast, the highest among over two dozen analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters, is now more than $200 above the stock's price, which has fallen $100 from September's peak.Musk, whose refusal to answer analysts' questions on a call this month also hurt company shares, said in his weekend tweets that Tesla had to focus first on delivering Model 3s that were priced higher than the base version, or it would ""die"".""With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live,"" Musk tweeted.The new Model 3 version's price was similar to the BMW M3, ""but 15 percent quicker & with better handling,"" Musk added, without giving details.Also over the weekend, a Model S sedan crashed and killed the driver in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of a recent spate of crashes, some of which involved fire and some of which took place while the company's semi-autonomous Autopilot technology was engaged.In the latest case, the car launched off a rural county road into a nearby pond more than 60 feet from the road, state and local law enforcement said.The car appeared to be going faster than the posted 35 mph limit, but authorities had not yet determined its speed and whether Autopilot was engaged, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.Tesla said it did not yet know the facts and had not yet received data from the car, but was cooperating with local authorities. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was gathering information and would ""take action as appropriate.""On Friday, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) backed a shareholder proposal to separate Musk's current chairman and CEO roles, suggesting that shareholders would be better served by having Musk focus on running the company. Tesla shares closed up 2.8 percent to $284.49 on the Nasdaq.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.2 percent by 0840 GMT after spending some time in negative territory as it moved towards a heavy week of earnings.Falls in business morale in Germany and Italy had little impact on trading but rising oil prices buoyed shares in the energy sector and offered some support to European indexes. Consumer staples stocks, which investors have held as proxies to bonds for their stable revenues and income stream, rebounded after a session of losses on Monday when U.S. 10-year treasury yields threatened to cross the 3 percent benchmark and make their returns less attractive. Austria-based chipmaker and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  supplier AMS (S:AMS) tumbled 13 percent after reporting lower orders from one of its main customers which it did not name, sending shares in other companies in the sector down.

Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) however added 1.6 percent. It may spell out strategy changes for its investment bank on Thursday along with first-quarter earnings.Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) had failed to cheer up investors on Monday after its flagship wealth management business missed forecasts.The automobile sector (SXAP), which has been a clear outperformer since the beginning of the year, edged down 0.5 percent, dragged down by AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb).The truck maker cautioned that its supply chain was coming under pressure and saw its shares fall about 4 percent. Results from French tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and automaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) also disappointed with shares down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively.Dutch paints and coatings maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO) lost 4.5 percent after reporting a larger-than-expected 28 percent drop in first-quarter core profit.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive's departure was agreed this week, according to one of the company sources.""As of today Stefan Mueller has not left the company,"" Renault spokesman Frederic Texier said. He declined to comment when asked whether Mueller's departure had been decided.German-born Mueller and Bollore, a French former  Michelin  (PA:MICP) executive, both joined Renault in 2012.Ghosn, 63, had earlier been expected to hand over the reins to a new chief executive and move to a another role at the helm of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.But sources said the plan foundered on differences with the French state, Renault's biggest shareholder, over the alliance's future shape and direction. Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan (T:7201), which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) via a 34 percent stake.Renault now plans to propose Ghosn's reappointment to the next annual shareholder meeting in June, sources also said, confirming a Feb. 1 report in Le Figaro.The government has yet to agree with Renault on a ""road map"" for the alliance or bless Bollore's promotion to the new position of chief operating officer and heir apparent.Both sides are seeking to avoid a repeat of a bitter 2015 clash in which France raised its Renault stake to swing a shareholder vote and secure double voting rights. The government also pushed unsuccessfully for a full Renault-Nissan merger on terms that would safeguard French industrial interests.The appointment of Ghosn's second-in-command is expected to be approved at a Feb. 15 board meeting ahead of Renault's full-year results presentation the following day.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

109,"Nov 15, 2017 09:20AM ET","Formula E will leave Britain if no Brexit deal, says CEO",nan,"By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - The London-based Formula E electric car racing series will leave Britain if Brexit goes ahead without a deal on tax and employment, Spanish chief executive Alejandro Agag said on Wednesday.The global city-based championship, which will be starting its fourth season in Hong Kong on Dec. 2, employs about 100 staff at its West London headquarters.Agag, who has lived in London for 15 years, said he was ""very worried"" by Brexit and Formula E could relocate its business to the European Union in the space of a day if necessary.""We have a lot of expats that work in the company...probably of our 100 employees, 50 are British and 50 are from other countries,"" he told Reuters at a media breakfast with members of the Jaguar team.""And a lot of our contracts come from the European Union in terms of sponsorship, so if there is not a deal in terms of tax and employment, we will leave.""We probably would leave overnight. We could make a decision in one day and then leave. We’re looking at different options. Maybe Holland, maybe Monaco. Some nearby place in the European Union,"" he added.Agag said his strong preference would be to stay - not least because he had just bought a new house. But withholding tax being imposed on sponsorship payments from EU-based partners once Britain leaves the EU in 2019 would force his hand.""If there are withholding taxes on sponsorship payments, that would make our business impossible. So then we would have to leave. And of course if the people cannot stay here working then that would make us leave also,"" he said.""A sponsor from France, like  Michelin  (PA:MICP) for example, the fee they pay me will have a 30 percent withholding. So my revenue will go down by 30 percent.""And if I move to France or Holland, I will get the whole fee. It’s a no-brainer.""DOORSTEP DISRUPTIONMost of the teams are based in Britain but the country has been off the Formula E calendar since 2016 after residents near Battersea Park complained of the disruption on their doorstep.Agag said the immediate prospect of London hosting another race was slim, with a proposed ePrix down the central Mall and around Buckingham Palace rejected by Royal Parks.But talks are continuing with other boroughs.""We don’t really need to be in London. We want to be in London if we are welcome in London,"" Agag said.""In other places in the world we are really welcome. We race in the center of Paris, we race in Rome, we race in Hong Kong. And we don’t even have one complaint from residents.""Formula E will have 14 races in 11 host cities in the 2017-18 season with four new venues in Rome, Zurich, Sao Paulo and the Chilean capital Santiago. The ePrix in Switzerland will be the country's first motor race since 1955. The country lifted restrictions on circuit racing in 2015 for fully-electric vehicles.The series is part-owned by Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) and has attracted strong manufacturer interest, with Porsche and Mercedes set to enter from Year Six. Nissan will replace alliance partners  Renault  (PA:RENA) in 2018.Other manufacturers involved are BMW, Audi, Jaguar, Citroen and India's Mahindra.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

128,"Jun 30, 2017 07:17AM ET",'Bad' foreign firms drive U.S. manufacturing jobs revival,nan,"By Lesley Wroughton and Howard SchneiderSPARTANBURG/CHARLESTON, South Carolina (Reuters) - Years before Donald Trump began promising to bring back good manufacturing jobs by getting tough with U.S. trade partners, such jobs have already been on the rise, largely thanks to foreign companies now cast as villains in Trump's narrative.Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.More recent jobs numbers are not yet available, but over $700 billion in foreign capital has poured in over the last two years bringing total foreign investment to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2016, a world record. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2sWkzTB)Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump's way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOYThe courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (PA:AIR) plant in Mobile, Alabama. Few places highlight the gap between Trump's rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map. ""The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,"" McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW's newest X3 sports utility vehicle.Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.But the poster child of South Carolina's success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW's plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump's ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was ""very bad"" on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg. “We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,"" Oliver Zipse, BMW's board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ""We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.” The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ""America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.DOOMSDAY SCENARIO""Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don't tear it up,"" Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. ""We're going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less."" Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina's once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP).The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.Mercedes-Benz, part of  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a ""doomsday scenario"" for the region.""This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don't understand the ramifications.""(1 euro = $1.1350)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

144,"Feb 23, 2017 03:52AM ET","Ghosn cedes Nissan CEO role, to focus on alliance with Renault, Mitsubishi",nan,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Chang-Ran KimTOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said Carlos Ghosn will step aside as CEO after leading the firm for 16 years, allowing him to concentrate on deploying his cost-cutting expertise across its alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and newly added Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211).In handing over the helm to Hiroto Saikawa, a company veteran of 40 years, Ghosn ends years of speculation over when he would relinquish the top job at Japan's No. 2 automaker amid investor concerns that he was stretching himself too thin.The change in leadership is aimed at making the best use of the greater scale that Mitsubishi brings to lower costs at a time when automakers are under pressure to expand and compete in new technologies such as self-driving cars.Known as 'Le Cost Killer' from his earlier career at Renault, Ghosn burnished his reputation by engineering Nissan's comeback from years of losses and debt. Unafraid to trample over long-standing business customs, he became a hero in Japan and one of the auto industry's best known executives.Ghosn, 62, will continue to be chairman at Nissan, a position he also holds at Renault and Mitsubishi. He also leaves in his place a man cut from very similar cloth.Saikawa is a veteran cost-cutter with much of his career spent in managing purchasing and supply chains. The 63-year old was named the company's chief competitive officer in 2013, became co-CEO last November and also currently heads Japan's auto industry lobby.""The timing is a bit surprising,"" said Takeshi Miyao, Asia managing director at consultancy Carnorama. ""It appears Ghosn has decided very quickly that Saikawa is the right person to lead the company.""Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Ghosn began his career at  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France, moving on to Renault, where he oversaw a turnaround of the automaker.He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its CEO in 2001. Nissan is the strongest of automakers in the alliance, long outperforming Renault in terms of vehicle sales and profits, while Mitsubishi still needs an overhaul after a mileage cheating scandal last year.Bringing Mitsubishi into the fold has put the three-way alliance on par with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) - all producing around 10 million vehicles annually.That has brought an opportunity to benefit from scale but also the challenge of balancing the interests of all three automakers.""Ghosn is likely to focus on strengthening and raising profitability at all the alliance members so that they are not overly dependent on Nissan,"" said Miyao.""Even if the alliance as a whole produces 10 million cars, if 3 million of those cars are not profitable it will be difficult for the alliance to continue.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

147,"Feb 03, 2017 06:00AM ET",Rising costs lurk behind brighter European corporate results,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - The rising cost of raw materials is likely to be risk for European firms, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said, adding that the impact of inflation and companies' pricing power were key themes emerging from the ongoing results season.Rising commodity prices have fueled increased inflation expectations in Europe, and sparked the so-called ""reflation"" trade since last summer as investors rushed into shares of banks, industrials and resources firms.However, higher prices for raw materials compounded by weaker currencies like sterling mean that for those companies unable to pass on costs to customers, profit margins are likely to come under pressure.Overall, fourth quarter earnings in Europe are expected to rise 12.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data while sales are seen rising only 1.7 percent, underscoring the investor focus on profit margins.European industrials and consumer-facing companies could be among those most affected, Goldman Sachs said, and those with already low margins were most vulnerable.""On recent earnings calls, several companies have highlighted that raw materials are expected to move from a being tailwind in 2016 to a headwind in 2017,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note to clients.The U.S. investment bank pointed to recent comments from Electrolux (ST:ELUXb), Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), among others, highlighting rising costs of everything from chemicals, plastics to palm oil.In this environment, Goldman Sachs recommends investors seek out companies that have a history of pricing power.  Assa Abloy  (ST:ASSAb),  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and  Legrand  (PA:LEGD) in the industrial goods sector have shown stable historical margins, suggesting they are among those companies able to withstand cost pressures, Goldman said.There was limited evidence that wage pressures were building up at European firms, though Goldman warned that this could be risk for those companies exposed to the U.S. and the UK.Bakery firm Aryzta (S:ARYN) plunged last month after a profit warning blamed partly on rising costs.Wage increases in the U.S. could hit firms such as  Wolseley  (L:WOS), Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD),  Bunzl  (L:BNZL) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), whose U.S. sales exposure is between 58-66 percent according to Goldman figures.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

153,"Dec 01, 2016 12:07PM ET",Q&A: How José Andrés grew from apprentice to top chef,nan,"By Cheryl Lu-Lien TanNEW YORK (Reuters) - Award-winning chef and restaurateur José Andrés got his start the old-fashioned way - as a teenage apprentice. Andrés worked his way up from a convention center restaurant in Barcelona to an American-based food empire in ThinkFoodGroup, which includes acclaimed restaurants, catering services and a food truck. Now 47, Andres just received two  Michelin  (PA:MICP) stars for his Washington, D.C.-based restaurant minibar, and was recently honored by President Barack Obama with a National Humanities Medal. Andres has even made headlines for a restaurant he did not open, at President-elect Donald Trump's new hotel in Washington, D.C., for which he is still embroiled in a $10 million breach of contract lawsuit.Andrés had a chat with Reuters about the life lessons he has learned along his journey:Q: What did your first job at that convention center teach you?A: There were four people in the kitchen and sometimes we were serving 200 or 300 people at once. What I learned was that as a worker, when you work and you make yourself useful and indispensable, your value always increases. Q: When you were starting your own business, what lessons about money stuck with you?A: It was 1994 that I got my first loan from a bank to pay for a little investment in a restaurant with my partner, Cafe Atlantico in Miami. We weren’t super prepared. The restaurant did OK but two or three years later, it closed. The life lesson was that if you don’t raise your own money, you don’t really learn the value of owning something. We all have dreams but at the end of the day, the numbers have to make sense. Bills have to be paid and salaries and rent - you cannot escape that fate. Q: What did you buy with your first paycheck?A: I bought a cookbook - ""The Escoffier Cookbook and Guide to the Fine Art of Cookery."" Knowledge is power and that book was like the heart of French cooking. That’s a book that’s been very important in my life. I also bought a Supertramp cassette of a concert in Paris. It gave me a lot of joy.Q: What has become your secret to business success? A: Make quick decisions. It’s almost like Darwin in the business world. The strongest will survive and adaptation is key. I’ve been fairly good at evolving - I never graduated from a school and I didn’t have a normal studying life but I kept learning as I kept moving. I was a cook, then I became a chef, then I had an investment partner, then I became an owner. I always knew what I lacked and always tried to surround myself with people who had what I lacked or what I needed more of. Q: As you became more established in your career, what did you learn about handling your personal wealth?A: I've never been a good handler of money. In my house, my wife manages our finances. I don't even know what’s in the book. If she leaves me one day, I don't even know my bank account number. Once you believe in somebody, make sure you choose well so you can concentrate on other things.Q: You and your wife started a non-profit, World Central Kitchen, in 2012. How does this fit into your philosophy on giving back? A: Hunger issues are very much at the heart of it for me. I've been involved in a lot of things like L.A. Kitchen, Capital Food Fight and Martha’s Table. The lesson here is to put money and commitment into something you care about - at the end of the day, food is so much at the heart of everything to me.Q: What money lessons do you pass down to your daughters (ages 12, 14 and 17)?A: Sometimes I feel like the more physical things we own, the less free we are. Making money somehow is easy - saving money somehow is very difficult. So don't really spend the money on the things that are that one more thing you're going to be selling at your garage sale. Time is money and every day the clock is ticking and every day we have less time. So I will say that I want to die rich of experiences and moments. I don't want to die rich with an immense quantity of belongings.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

154,"Nov 20, 2016 12:00PM ET","Italy's Renzi gets backing in referendum from singers, athletes, chef",nan,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's most famous chef and more than 80 actors, singers, directors and athletes on Sunday backed a constitutional change to be voted on in two weeks, giving Prime Minister Matteo Renzi desperately needed support.Italians will vote in a Dec. 4 referendum over whether to accept Renzi's flagship reform, which would drastically reduce the role of the Senate (upper house of parliament) and take powers back from regional governments. While poll results cannot be published during the final 15 days ahead of the vote, surveys released before the Friday cutoff showed the ""No"" vote firmly ahead.To try to turn the trend around, the 41-year-old Renzi continued his furious campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote on Sunday, repeating on a talk show that he does not intend to ""scrape by"" as prime minister if he loses.Italian banking stocks fell to their lowest level in six weeks on Friday and bond yields rose for a fourth week on the prospect that a ""No"" vote may topple Renzi's government and usher in a period of political instability.Massimo Bottura, whose Osteria Francescana has three  Michelin  (PA:MICP) stars and was named the world's best restaurant this year, told Italy's most-read newspaper on Sunday that he may leave the country if the constitutional reform is defeated.""If the 'No' wins I'll be tempted to drop everything and move abroad,"" said Bottura, whose restaurant is in Modena, Italy. If the logic that ""in Italy things can't get done"" wins ""then it's all over,"" he said in Corriere della Sera newspaper.Separately, more than 80 well-known Italians signed a appeal in support of a ""Yes"" vote, saying that while Renzi's reform is not perfect, it would help break gridlock in Rome.Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino, World Cup-winning soccer player Marco Tardelli and actor Luca Zingaretti were among those who signed the appeal.""Actors, singers and dancers sign an appeal for a ""Yes"" vote ... These are (Renzi's) rich and wise 'educators',"" Northern League party leader Matteo Salvini said. Like all opposition party leaders, Salvini is campaigning for a ""No"" vote.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

156,"Sep 13, 2016 02:10AM ET",Czech parties gear up to clip wings of billionaire finance minister,nan,"By Jan LopatkaPRAGUE (Reuters) - He is a vivacious billionaire businessman who has emerged as his country's most popular politician, offering Czechs a break with old parties tainted by graft; but opponents who see in Andrej Babis a threat to democracy are pressing him to choose between his commercial empire and political power.Babis, product of the disillusionment with elites that has shaped politics from Rome and Madrid to London and Washington, is favorite to win an Oct. 2017 election with his ANO movement. He is, he says, no politician - despite his five years in politics - but a businessman who gets things done.Not all in politics see the current Finance Minister in such a favorable light.The Czech parliament may vote as soon as Wednesday on ""Lex Babis"", an attempt to limit the accumulation of media, business and political power which, for some, Babis represents.The proposed amendments to the 'conflict of interest' law, backed by some government and some opposition factions, would ban any future member of cabinet from controlling companies or having stakes in the media. Firms where they own over 25 percent would lose access to public contracts, non-automatic subsidies and investment aid. Some have compared Babis with former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who combined media and business with political power. In the United States, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has drawn on the same anger with the political elite, though Babis might eschew any such comparison.Babis is the biggest private employer in the central European country with over 30,000 workers in over 250 companies from chemical firms to newspapers and fertility clinics. His weighty business persona he leavens in running a  Michelin  (PA:MICP) star restaurant in France, sponsoring pop bands and sending wry tweets. But his rivals are not assuaged.""The aim of the proposals is that one person cannot sign a decision in the name of the state at 8.10 and instruct a company he controls about which public tenders to take part in at 8.20,"" said Martin Plisek, deputy for the opposition TOP09 party who proposed some of the amendments.""A LAW AGAINST ME""Babis sees the graft not on his doorstep. In this he finds popular resonance after a series of scandals involving public tenders and distribution of EU funds. A center-right cabinet collapsed in 2013, although graft investigations have not led to any high profile convictions. Under the proposed law, Babis, if he were to join the next cabinet, or lead it as prime minister, would have to reduce his stake in his main holding firm Agrofert below 40 percent or transfer it to a trust fund, and end his media engagement.Babis has admitted having conflicts of interest but said he never abused his position.""It is a law against me,"" Babis said in an interview with the weekly Tyden released on Monday. ""If it is approved, I will start dealing with it, and my lawyers will make a recommendation to me. I cannot rule out a constitutional suit.""Babis had earlier warned the law could break up the ruling coalition ANO is part of, but has not repeated the threats in recent weeks.The former communist party member and foreign trade official has built up Agrofert since the mid-1990s through a series of acquisitions.Its Czech operations received 5.5 billion crowns ($228.48 million) in Czech and EU subsidies between 2006 and 2014, according to the latest data Agrofert provided. Agrofert said these included farming subsidies, available to all farmers equally, and environmental investment aid approved by previous governments. The group also has multiple business engagements with the state, such as provision and storage of commodity reserves. One of the amendments, proposed by deputy Jan Chvojka from Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka's Social Democrats, would ban ownership of media by a member of cabinet. Babis bought two of the country's handful of daily newspapers and the most popular radio station in 2013, resulting in the departure of dozens of staff. ""The media should play a controlling role. Of course when a member of the government owns a significant media outlet, it does not fulfill this role,"" Chvojka told Reuters.Earlier this year, Babis faced accusations that he had bent rules in 2008 by temporarily transferring ownership of a conference center project to his family members so it could qualify for an EU development subsidy only meant for small firms. He denied any wrongdoing in that case.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

158,"Aug 02, 2016 07:50AM ET",Mexico may offer fix for some U.S. exporters in Trump bind,nan,"By Dave GrahamMEXICALI, Mexico (Reuters) - For Allied Tool & Die Company, Donald Trump's threats to tear up trade deals and impose steep tariffs if he becomes the next U.S. president means considering doubling down on Mexico as a base to manufacture for foreign markets.The Phoenix-based aerospace supplier, and a small but rising number of U.S. companies with plants in Mexican industrial hubs like the border city of Mexicali, say they may have to increase their capacity in the country's lower cost base to sell goods abroad if the Republican nominee wins the White House. ""What would I do if a giant wall of tariffs were erected in front of me?"" said Allied Tool Chief Executive Officer Bill Jordan. ""Rather than having the parts travel through the United States to somewhere else, I would create a Mexican company to sell directly to other international companies. We just wouldn't go through the United States,"" he said of his non-U.S. clients.So far, Trump's campaign pledges - such as threatening to roll out punitive tariffs, ditch the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and wall off Mexico from the United States - have flummoxed constituents ranging from traders on Wall Street to economists and politicians.While his rival Hillary Clinton has said she may want to rework elements of trade deals as president, she has not called for tariffs.The initial strategic planning by Allied Tool and others with operations in Mexico is one of the first signs of how business are preparing for the possibility of a President Trump.Driven by a desire to simplify supply chains ahead of what would be an era of uncertainty in cross-border commerce, expansion in Mexico would also move in lock-step with recent capital flows across the Pacific drawn by Mexico's rising cost advantage over China.""The trend of considering Mexico as a place to build export platforms to countries other than the United States has accelerated,"" said Emilio Cadena, CEO of Grupo Prodensa, a firm that specializes in helping foreign companies move to Mexico.Dozens of U.S. firms involved in making cars, electronics, appliances and other sectors are contemplating such a move, many exporting to elsewhere in the Americas, Cadena added, though he declined to name them lest they face criticism on the campaign trail.Few Mexican cities have lured more U.S. capital than Mexicali, a onetime agricultural outpost built up by Chinese immigrants a century ago, whose sleepy, run-down old town now forms the center of a giant web of buzzing, state-of-the-art industrial plants that stretch into the surrounding desert.Across the city, multinationals manufacture everything from Coca-Cola (N:KO) drinks to Apple (O:AAPL)smartphone chips and sections of Boeing's (N:BA) latest jet airliners. Over the past year, half the U.S. firms that dominate Mexicali's assembly plants have been expanding capacity, said Francisco Fiorentini, executive vice president of industrial park developer PIMSA.Meanwhile, inquiries by multinationals about Mexico as a business location jumped about 20 percent in the year through June, according to Solomon Abudarham, leader of LATAM Global Data Quality at business information provider Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB).Mexico's proximity to the United States has been a win-win situation for both countries, said Allied Tool's Jordan.Since expanding into Mexicali six years ago, Allied Tool has created 13 jobs in Mexico, and even more in Phoenix, lifting its total there by 25 percent. It now employs 105 people. ""It freed up time so we could do other stuff in Phoenix,"" he said.One big reason is the cost of labor.According to a study carried out by PIMSA, one U.S. industrial company operating in Mexicali's home state of Baja California logged a total annual labor cost for an assembly line worker of $7,000. For California, its cost was $42,000.Still, wary of a Trump presidency and mindful of their exposure to the U.S. market, some American firms are postponing investments until the election is over, said Juan Manuel Hernandez, CEO of Loginam, a Tijuana-based logistics company.    Hernandez estimated about 10 to 15 percent of output from U.S. exporters in Mexico go to non-U.S. markets. Nearly 80 percent of Mexican exports head to the United States. Some components can cross the border several times before products are completed. Others are taking Trump, his hopes of victory and his protectionist threats, with a pinch of salt.""We're used to political demagoguery - but at some point there has to be the specificity of policy,"" says Ronald DeFeo, CEO of  Kennametal  Inc (N:KMT), an industrial toolmaker in Pittsburgh with sales of $2.6 billion and customers in over 60 countries.Until then, ""we'll continue to operate the way we always operate,"" DeFeo added, saying a shake-up of the kind Trump proposes could not be rolled out quickly.MOST COMPANIES KEEPING MUMNone of over two dozen executives and policymakers consulted by Reuters in Mexico believe that if Trump does win, Congress will want to enact measures that may hit the U.S. economy hard.""I don't think it will happen,"" said Luis Aguirre, vice president for logistics and government relations in Mexico of U.S. electronics maker Sanmina Corp (O:SANM). ""If it did, I think there would be more U.S. capital in Mexico to cope with this possible countervailing duty. He'll hurt investment in his own country.""If Trump did succeed in imposing such measures, it was ""obvious"" that Sanmina would look at increasing capacity in Mexico to diversify products for other markets, he noted.Proposing tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican and 45 percent on Chinese goods, Trump has sought to brand U.S. firms investing in Mexico as unpatriotic, lashing out at the likes of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Carrier, a maker of air conditioners which in February said it would move hundreds of U.S. jobs there.That has simply made some firms keep quiet about Mexico.""American firms are investing without making announcements because they're waiting for the results in November,"" said Guillermo Romero, economy minister of the state of Guanajuato, which in the past few weeks revealed investments by France's  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and Germany's ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG).Whether a Trump tariff would take U.S. content in Mexican goods - often as high as 40 percent - into account, is unclear.However, concern that business costs are likely to rise in the United States whoever wins in November's elections is pushing U.S. firms to accelerate shortening supply lines away from Asia toward Mexico, said Cesar Ponce, chief executive of WDF Services, a Mexicali aerospace supplier.""All the big companies present in Mexico are following the trend of moving suppliers here,"" said Ponce. ""I think Donald Trump is going to strengthen us, not kill us.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

165,"May 15, 2016 07:49PM ET",Global PE firms find sweet spot in Japan's food sector,nan,"By Junko FujitaTOKYO (Reuters) - From sushi to bean sprouts to mushrooms, global private equity firms are dining on Japan's thriving restaurant scene as they wait for the country's notoriously slow conglomerates to restructure and reverse a slump in major deals.Europe's Permira (PERM.UL) and U.S.-based Bain Capital are among the buyout firms finding value in the fiercely competitive world of mainly privately-owned restaurants that make Tokyo one of the world's eating capitals.While they may be small, deals like Carlyle Group's (O:CG) investment in bean sprouts producer GGC Group for an undisclosed amount in March are welcome news after the volume of global private equity buyouts in Japan fell by half in 2015 to well below $1 billion.""Private equity firms have better chances for success in the food and restaurant sectors in Japan,"" said Kazushige Kobayashi, the Tokyo-based managing director at Capital Dynamics, a Swiss-based company that invests in PE funds. ""These industries are fragmented so competition is not fierce. Lots of smaller companies means lots of opportunities for M&As, which will help each company to grow.""Permira, for instance, took over No.1 conveyor sushi restaurant chain Akindo Sushiro in 2012 and is now considering a stock market listing, after almost doubling its value thanks to cost-cutting that saved money on fresh tuna by tapping Permira's global network.The conveyor sushi market grew 7.2 percent to 558.3 billion yen ($5.13 billion) in 2015, according to research firm NPD Japan. ""They can roll out new outlets because they can buy ingredients cheaper by streamlining operations, and advanced technology for food processing enables them to buy fresh ingredients,"" NPD Japan account manager Takuma Kato said.Bain had similar success with the flotation of restaurant chain Skylark Co (T:3197) in 2014. For its part, Carlyle is looking to expand GGC Group in China, a bean sprouts market almost 10 times bigger than Japan. ""This is a sign that private equity firms are willing to take risks to source deals,"" said Soichi Takata, head of private equity at Tokio Marine Asset Management. Bain last year bought mushroom producer Yukiguni Maitake Co for about 10 billion yen, making its first investment in raw food materials in Japan. ""Areas such as fruit and fresh vegetables are growing pretty nicely these days,"" Bain Managing Director David Gross-Loh said, citing a trend toward healthier living. WOK STARSTokyo is one of the world's great food cities, with far more  Michelin  (PA:MICP) three-star restaurants than either Paris or New York. It is also a hive of innovation with new trends constantly appearing, such as standing-only steak houses and high-end hamburger stores. ""There are always new restaurants emerging in various styles in Japan and these are typically set up by entrepreneurs,"" Permira's chief in Japan, Ryotaro Fujii, said. Often small, such companies tended to seek outside capital and expertise once they grew to a certain point, he added. ""But they don't want to be absorbed by others because they want to maintain their independence, which is why private equity firms have room to step in,"" he said, declining to comment on plans for a Sushiro IPO.In addition, smaller restaurant businesses typically generate stable cash flows while being managed by their hard-pressed founders. This presents buyout firms with potential for growth.""Businesses are often under-managed,"" Bain's Gross-Loh said. Carlyle Group , KKR & Co (N:KKR), TPG Capital Management (TPG.UL) opened offices in Japan in early 2000s, hoping to grab multi-billion deals through corporate carve-outs.But the value of deals by buyout firms in Japan halved to $600 million last year from $1.16 billion in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The Italian has won six times in 16 starts at the southern circuit in the top flight.

The session started late after final free practice was delayed because five out of the 10  Michelin  (PA:MICP) tire fitters were laid low by sickness, meaning it took twice as long to prepare the bikes.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

172,"Mar 16, 2016 10:20AM ET",Rossi and Marquez renew rivalry with Qatar kick-off,nan,"By Alan BaldwinLONDON (Reuters) - The MotoGP season kicks off in Qatar this weekend with fresh challenges and old rivalries as Valentino Rossi and Marc Marquez square up again for the first time since last year's toxic finale.An aggrieved Rossi, now 37 and the oldest rider on the grid, decried a Spanish 'stitch-up' last November after accusing Honda's Marquez of helping Jorge Lorenzo win his third MotoGP title for Yamaha.Rossi, Lorenzo's team mate and title rival, finished fourth in that race in Valencia after being sent to the back of the grid for a clash with Marquez in the previous race in Malaysia. Marquez, a double world champion and still only 23, has taken on the role of Rossi's arch-enemy after the Italian accused him of acting like Lorenzo's 'bodyguard' and not attempting to pass.Lorenzo is not far behind in the bad books after suggesting that the Italian, who boasts the longest winning career in grand prix history and is one of the all-time greats, will never win the 10th world championship he craves.The bad blood between some of motorcycling's biggest names led the governing International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) to intervene last October, accusing them of having 'poisoned the atmosphere'.Rossi, who won under the Qatar floodlights in last year's opener, is not one to forget a grievance but is also eager to get back to racing.""After what happened, there can never be any kind of personal relationship between us,"" he told Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport last week. ""He (Marquez) really betrayed me. He arrived (in MotoGP) saying he was a fan of mine but it was all lies.""Rossi, who will be starting his 21st season in grand prix racing, hopes to be back on the podium at least on Sunday. He singled out Lorenzo, who dominated pre-season testing in Malaysia and Qatar with the fastest times, as the man to beat.Marquez and his Honda team mate Dani Pedrosa have had more difficulties in coming to terms with electronics changes and a switch to  Michelin  (PA:MICP) tyres but are also sure to be in the mix sooner or later.Spaniard Maverick Vinales, a former Moto3 champion and still only 21, has attracted attention with strong testing performances with Suzuki. The new season will have riders using the same control units and software provided by Magneti Marelli, which should level the playing field, while Michelin have replaced Bridgestone as official tyre supplier after a seven-year absence.The only rookie in the top category is Spain's 2014 Moto2 champion Tito Rabat. Former champion Nicky Hayden of the United States has departed along with Italians Alex de Angelis and Marco Melandri. The 18-race championship ends in Valencia again in November.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

174,"Oct 31, 2015 08:10AM ET","With anti-trade message, Trump targets 'Reagan Democrats'",nan,"By James OliphantANDERSON, S.C. (Reuters) - To hear Donald Trump tell it, blue-collar workers here are suffering as much as ever, their livelihoods endangered by the familiar combination of foreign competition and U.S. companies eager to hold down labor costs.It's Trump's mantra. He repeats it again and again at campaign stops like the one he made here last week. A leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has made the health of the U.S. manufacturing a cornerstone of his insurgent campaign.In doing so, Trump is targeting a big pool of potential voters among disaffected blue-collar workers, even if it means alienating the business community and conservative free-market advocates and brings accusations of demagoguery.He vows to slap penalties on goods produced by U.S. companies outside the country, make it harder for China and others to export their goods, and tear up trade deals that he says hurt the U.S. industry. ""I wonder how many Chevrolets are in the middle of Tokyo?' he told the Anderson crowd to applause. ""I would say none.""And at the economy-themed Republican debate held Wednesday in Boulder, Colorado., Trump pledged to ""bring jobs back"" from China and Mexico.There are signs that Trump's strategy is working.Polls show that the bulk of Trump's support comes from men who lack a college degree and make less than $40,000 a year, the kind of workers who once formed the backbone of the U.S. manufacturing economy. They have helped propel Trump to the top of popularity rankings in South Carolina, a key early primary state, where he is outpacing rival Ben Carson.""Some of the Republicans get so tied up with free trade,"" said Lee Cole, a Republican attorney from nearby Williamston who attended Trump's event. ""Over the past 20 years, we've lost all of our manufacturing jobs,"" Cole said of his hometown. ""Anything that talks about getting some of that back I think really resonates well here."" Government data shows that less than 30 percent of Americans have four-year college degrees and more than half of U.S. workers make less than $30,000 a year, so at stake is a vast pool of potential voters.""He's tapped into an uneasiness, and he's done it cleverly,"" said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in Greenville, South Carolina, who is not aligned with Trump. ""He's played it to the hilt.""TRUMP DEMOCRATS?At the Anderson event, Trump talked up his blue-collar support, comparing himself to Franklin Roosevelt. His campaign brings up another name: Ronald Reagan. Ed McMullen, Trump's campaign strategist in South Carolina, says the billionaire contender has his sights on ""Reagan Democrats"" - working-class voters who tend to support moderates. Those moderate voters famously switched sides and helped Republican Reagan win the 1980 election and the Trump campaign believes it could happen again in 2016 if he makes it to the general election.According to a Pew Research Center survey taken late last month, Trump's supporters tend to attend church less frequently than the entire Republican electorate and more often identify themselves as ""moderate"" or ""liberal."" Critics say that Trump is proffering an outdated, simplistic, and overly pessimistic view of the U.S. economy, one that fails to grasp the multi-national complexity of global manufacturing. Nowhere is that more apparent than in South Carolina where 700 international firms employ 115,900 people, according to State Department of Commerce data. That makes for the highest percentage of private-industry workforce employed by foreign-owned firms.Just up the road from Trump's stop in Anderson sits a 5-million square foot German-owned BMW (DE:BMWG) plant that employs 8,000. Nearby is a  Michelin  (PA:MICP) facility, one of nine in the state owned by the French company. And Swedish automaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb) earlier this year announced plans to build a plant near Charleston, that could end up employing 4,000 workers.""All of these companies are part of the modern global supply chain,"" says Scott Lincicome, a trade policy expert with the conservative Cato Institute, calling Trump's ideas ""completely unmoored from reality."" ""It's ironic he would go to the one's country's burgeoning manufacturing hubs to bemoan the state of manufacturing.""Femi Fadeyi, an engineer for German-owned SEW Eurodrive, an industrial equipment firm that has a facility in nearby Lyman, said he moved from Colorado during the height of the recession because of the economic opportunity.An independent, Fadeyi said Trump made him follow the Republican race, but he remained skeptical.""I don't understand how Trump plans to actually execute many of these goals - some of which are conflicting,"" Fadeyi told Reuters. Still, even as the state's workforce returned to pre-recession levels already in June 2013, sooner than most of the country, it has only recovered 40 percent of manufacturing jobs lost in the downturn, according to Manufacturers' News, Inc., a publisher and compiler of industrial directories and databases. The textile sector has been particularly hit hard, with abandoned mills dotting the landscape around Anderson and Greenville, allowing Trump's message to resonate with many.Trump is hoping to develop an early momentum in early primaries held February in Iowa and South Carolina and build on that in March in Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, and Tennessee, all states with sizeable manufacturing sectors accounting for more than 10 of the economy.""People see all that, see those investments, but there is something going on where they don't personally feel a benefit from it,"" Felkel said. ""Sometimes, it's easier to vote against something than for something.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

193,"Mar 23, 2015 12:38AM ET",ChemChina to buy Italian tire maker Pirelli in $7.7 billion deal,nan,"By Paola Arosio and Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) is to buy Pirelli (MI:PECI), the world's fifth-largest tire maker, in a 7.1 billion euro ($7.7 billion) deal that will place one of the symbols of Italy's manufacturing industry in Chinese hands.The deal agreed with Pirelli shareholders on Sunday is the latest in a string of takeovers in Italy by cash-rich Chinese buyers, who can take advantage of a weak euro just as signs emerge that Europe is coming out of economic stagnation.It will give state-owned ChemChina, led by acquisitive chairman Ren Jianxin, access to technology to make premium tires, which can be sold at higher margins, and give the Italian firm a boost in the huge Chinese market. The bid for Pirelli marks a return of China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to global dealmaking following a hiatus prompted by President Xi Jinping's anti-graft crackdown that targeted several current and former senior SOE officials.It would be China's fifth-biggest outbound deal by an SOE, according to Thomson Reuters data, and the first major acquisition since China's  MMG  Ltd (HK:1208) led a consortium last year to buy the huge Las Bambas copper mine in Peru from  Glencore  (L:GLEN).ChemChina's tire making unit China National Tire & Rubber will first buy the 26.2 percent that Italian holding firm Camfin owns in Pirelli, and will then launch a mandatory takeover bid for the rest.The bid will be launched by a vehicle controlled by the Chinese state-owned group and part-owned by Camfin investors, who include Pirelli boss Marco Tronchetti Provera, Italian banks UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), and Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN), Camfin said in a statement.The offer will be launched at 15 euros per share, valuing the group at 7.1 billion euros excluding net debt of almost 1 billion euros at the end of 2014. The ChemChina unit also envisages taking Pirelli private.As details of the deal were leaked on Friday, shares in Milan-listed Pirelli, which started business 143 years ago producing rubber items, rose to a 25-year high and closed at 15.23 euros - a sign that traders predict an improved offer or a rival bid.Sources close to the matter said on Friday the deal with the Chinese group will mean Rosneft, which is facing international sanctions due to the Ukraine crisis and needs to cut debt, reduces its stake in Pirelli.MORE BANDWIDTHThe agreement would give Beijing-based ChemChina access to technology used in making lucrative premium tires and could help China, already a global player in sectors such as telecoms and internet, develop its automotive industry. In turn Pirelli, whose tires equip cars in Formula One motor racing, would have more bandwidth to compete against larger rivals such as  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and Continental (DE:CONG) which are looking for growth in Asia. Camfin said on Sunday Pirelli's less profitable truck and industrial tire business would be folded into ChemChina's listed unit AEOLUS (SS:600469), allowing it to double its output.The new Chinese owners will pick a new chairman while Tronchetti Provera, who started working in the tire maker in 1986 after marrying a member of the Italian family that founded the firm, will remain chief executive.""We're pleased to have this opportunity working with Tronchetti and his team and continue to build together a world-class entity and a market leader in (the) global tire business,"" Ren said in a statement.Previous Chinese acquisitions in Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, include stakes in power grid firms  Terna  (MI:TRN) and Snam (MI:SRG), turbine maker Ansaldo and luxury yacht maker Ferretti [FRREF.UL].Excluding the financial sector, Italy is the second-biggest acquisition market for China in Europe and fifth-largest worldwide, with 10 deals completed since the start of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data.Rothschild and ChemChina Finance Corp advised ChemChina. J.P. Morgan (N:JPM) advised China National Tire & Rubber, while Lazard was the financial adviser to Camfin.($1 = 0.9221 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

194,"Mar 13, 2015 02:50PM ET",'Formula E' electric car race creates a quiet buzz in Miami,nan,"By Zachary FagensonMIAMI (Reuters) - The streets snaking through downtown Miami's high rises will be buzzing this Saturday as commuters make way for dart-shaped racing cars zooming by at breakneck speeds - and little noise.The race drivers will be competing in the first Formula E race in the United States since the all-electric series was launched in Beijing in September 2014.Halfway through its inaugural season, Formula E has offered the same, albeit quieter, thrills as the popular Formula One events, with low-slung, opened-wheeled cars capable of speeds up to 136 miles per hour (220 kilometers per hour).The Beijing race ended with a spectacular crash that sent one of the $500,000  Renault  SA (PARIS:RENA) cars flying.Danger and adrenaline are not all that you find on the track, however.""It's really something to see how racing has evolved to fully electric motors. It could revolutionize racing and transportation in general,"" said Daniel Fernandez, 17, who bought tickets with several high school friends to attend the race, which is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators.The series was launched by Jean Todt, a French racing icon and former Ferrari chief executive who heads of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) that oversees Formula One.It is backed by environmentalist and actor Leonardo DiCaprio and entrepreneur Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group sponsors a two-car team.FIA, which has partnered with Spanish private equity fund Amura Capital, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and cable billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global Plc, has attracted sponsors such as tire maker  Michelin  (PARIS:MICP) and courier service DHL hoping the series will help the development of mainstream electric cars.""The technology improves unbelievably once these large companies start investing in research,"" said Pier Luigi Ferrari, the managing director of DHL motorsports.The public has shown an interest and Elon Musk's electric car firm  Tesla Motors  Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already built up a following, although its stock has fallen lately as it missed sales targets.Developing a so-called green racing series has meant overhauling how the races are run. Car batteries cannot be charged mid-race, forcing drivers at some point to rush into a second, fully charged car.The cars give off a high-pitched whistling sound, a bit like a dentist's drill. Drivers also must carefully manage their power, a challenge for race cars with a limited battery life.""We have a target (power) consumption per lap and we need to respect that like the Bible,"" said Jaime Alguersuari, a 24-year-old Spanish driver with Virgin. ""You want to win, but if you burn up all your energy you won't finish.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Police retrieved more than 70 premium bottles this week following a monthlong, cross-country search for the missing loot, according to media reports.The Napa County Sheriff’s Office said three detectives flew to Greensboro, N.C., on Monday and recovered all but four of the 76 bottles taken during a Christmas Day break-in at the Michelin-starred French eatery. Authorities took the wine from someone in Greensboro that “we are categorizing as an unwitting and unsuspecting buyer,” Capt. Doug Pike told the Wall Street Journal.He said investigators returned to California with the wine Wednesday night, and no arrests have been made. The sheriff’s office is collaborating with state and federal law enforcement officials to crack the case of the stolen wine, which was reported missing Dec. 26, Pike told reporters.The haul included dozens of bottles of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, considered among the best wines in the world. The French Laundry charges $5,750 for a 1988 vintage from the Richebourg vineyard, according to the Napa Valley Register newspaper. Some of the other bottles are valued at more than $15,000 each.The still-unidentified wine capers might have intended to sell the hijacked bottles to a collector or small store that wouldn’t check for stolen goods as closely as larger outlets, complicating efforts to recover the wine, WSJ noted.A French Laundry spokesperson declined to speak to reporters, deferring comment to Napa County sheriff’s investigators.A similar wine robbery took place in January 2014 at the Napa Valley restaurant REDD. One or multiple suspects broke in during the restaurant’s annual holiday closure and ran off with 24 bottles, together worth $30,000, the Napa Valley Register noted. No bottles from that case have been recovered and no arrests have been made, Pike said."

 By Atul Prakash	 LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - European shares ended sharply
lower on Friday on concerns U.S. President Barack Obama's $447
billion jobs package might face hurdles in Congress and as the
resignation of a top European Central Bank official signalled a
rift within the central bank.	 The move by ECB Executive Board Member Juergen Stark to quit
in disagreement with the bank's policy of buying euro zone
government bonds to combat the currency bloc's debt crisis
further hurt sentiment at a time when the role of the central
bank was crucial to resolve the euro zone debt crisis.	 The ECB's bond-buying programme has rescued Italy and Spain
from debt crisis over the past month and there were concerns
Stark's resignation over the issue could lead to some policy
changes and weaken the bank's ability to deal with the crisis.	 In reaction, German 10-year government bond yields hit
record lows, while Italian bonds extended losses.	 Markus Huber, trader at ETX Capital said that the move
showed that possibly infighting was taking place within the
central bank. ""It could impact how the ECB reacts to the current
financial crisis and to the economic slowdown, which seems to
worsen as time progresses.""	 The FTSEurofirst 300 of top European shares ended
2.6 percent lower at 915.52 points. It hit a two-year low last
month and is down 18 percent this year. The Thomson Reuters
Peripheral Eurozone Index fell 6.2 percent. 	 ""It's hard to get excited about equities when they face such
considerable headwinds. The banking sector remains a dog of the
stock market with investors shunning every moment they start to
look like they've turned a corner,"" said Angus Campbell, head of
sales at Capital Spreads. 	 Banks were the hardest hit on concerns the policymakers were
not doing enough to prevent major economies moving back into
recession. The European banking index fell 4.9 percent,
while Societe Generale fell 10.6 percent.	 The focus was on a meeting of the Group of Seven countries
on Friday, with the United States pressing Europe's strongest
economies to help weaker euro zone states. IMF Managing Director
Christine Lagarde said advanced countries should use all
available tools to boost growth. 	 But some analysts said Obama's ambitious plan on jobs to
give a push to the struggling economy might face hurdles as a
Republican-dominated U.S. House of representatives might not
easily agree to the package. Analysts also question whether the
plan would make a real difference.	 ""Markets in the end question the effectiveness of these
measures. The total package that we will receive from Obama is
not as big as the headline number might suggest. When you look
at the employer payroll tax cuts, they are in place already,""
said Klaus Wiener, chief economist at Generali Investments,
which manages 330 billion euros ($453 billion).	  BEARISH TECHNICALS	 Charts showed the trend for the Euro STOXX 50 ,
the euro zone's blue chip index, was down and a gap of 16 points
between the lowest level on Sept. 2 and the highest point during
the next trading day was providing resistance.	 The index fell 4.2 percent to 2,073.67 points.	 ""The index still looks bearish and is looking for a retest
of support at 2,046, which is 78.6 percent retracement of the
rally between 2009 and 2011. If that gives way, we could be
headed back to the 2009 low of 1,765,"" said Phil Roberts, chief
European technical strategist at Barclays Capital.	 Analysts said equities were cheap in terms of valuations,
but investors were not rushing to buy purely on valuation
grounds as the earnings outlook could also deteriorate and that
could push back price-to-earnings ratios higher.	 According to Thomson Reuters Datastream, the STOXX Europe
600 index carried a 12-month forward price-to-earnings
ratio of 8.8, against a 10-year average of 13.2.	 Automobile shares also witnessed a sharp sell-off, with the
sector index falling 4.7 percent on worries a slowdown
in the global economy will severely hurt demand for vehicles.	 Credit Suisse kept its ""more cautious"" stance on the sector
and advised clients to wait for improved visibility. It said
globally deteriorating consumer confidence, retreating corporate
expenditure and increasing capacity were not a good starting
point for 2012 earnings performance.	 ""Valuation would suggest a strong buy signal for EU quality
names such as BMW , Daimler , Continental
 and Michelin right now. However, we fear
that the sentiment risk arising from negative earnings
revisions, once they materialize, in combination with corporates
adjusting their 2012 outlooks will trigger more downside for
autos stocks.""	 On the positive side, Tullow Oil jumped more than 15
percent after announcing an oil discovery offshore French Guiana
that Royal Bank of Scotland analysts called as ""game changing"".

 (Adds detail, background) PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - French tyre maker Michelin
announced on Wednesday a plan to cut 1,093 jobs on a voluntary
basis as part of a restructuring of its facilities as it battles
with falling demand from carmakers. Michelin added it would also invest more than 100 million
euros ($139 million) at its Clermont-Ferrand research and
development centre and hire around 500 people a year over the
next three years. Michelin's rival Continental, which is also struggling with
a sharp drop in orders from the auto industry, has already
announced the closure of plants in France and Germany, resulting
in the layoff of hundreds of workers. Earlier this year, U.S. rival Goodyear also said it planned
to cut 5,000 jobs worldwide this year. The company's 2008 annual report said the Michelin group had
117,565 employees. Michelin said on Wednesday that it remained committed to
maintaining core businesses in France and added it would carry
out its restructuring without any layoffs. In April, Michelin reported a 14 percent fall in first
quarter sales but said it was on track to meet its full-year
goal of achieving positive free cash flow. Michelin shares were down 2.9 percent at 41.71 euros in
mid-morning trade, underperforming a 0.8 percent fall in
France's benchmark CAC-40 index and a 1.2 percent decline in the
DJ Stoxx European automotive sector. Since the start of 2009, Michelin shares have risen around
11 percent compared with an 8 percent gain in the European auto
sector. The shares fell 52 percent last year.

better-than-expected Q1 results.  Investors were eyeing first-quarter U.S. growth data and the
