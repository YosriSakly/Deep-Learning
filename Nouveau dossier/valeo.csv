2,"Jun 12, 2019 01:05PM ET","Patent guidelines put tech firms, carmakers on collision course",nan,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Rival proposals for European patent guidelines covering technology vital for building self-driving cars and internet-linked vehicles have set tech firms and carmakers on a collision course.The differences between firms such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and vehicle manufacturers like BMW and Daimler over patent terms raises the prospect of legal challenges and antitrust suits, which have emerged in other industries that depend on access to technology.In May, a U.S. court told Qualcomm to overhaul its business practices for illegally suppressing competition in the smartphone chip market by threatening to cut off supplies and extracting excessive licensing fees. Tech firms and carmakers have outlined their positions in two diverging sets of guidelines relating to the way licensing fees are calculated and the terms for using patented technology.Both sets of guidelines have support from the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC).Although any guidelines are voluntary, the lack of broad agreement can mean disputes quickly escalate.IP Europe, a lobby group which includes Nokia and other European telecoms firms such as Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Orange, said its new guidelines would support small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) as they develop technology.""I believe these principles and guidance will help SMEs better understand the cellular licensing process, making it easier for them to participate in cellular standards development and licensing,"" IP Europe SME Chair Ruben Bonet said.Rival guidelines have been put forward with the backing of 56 organizations that include Daimler, BMW,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Honda.They have proposed a code that sets out six principles for assessing whether licensing fees for essential patents are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.""Companies can look at both guidelines and make their decisions,"" said Michael Sax, chairman of The App Association.Carmaker Daimler, automotive supplier Continental and auto parts firm  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) have all complained to the European Union antitrust regulators in the past about Nokia's codes covering use of the telecom equipment maker's patents that are vital for developing ""smart"" cars and self-driving vehicles.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Will Europe be next?Autos aren’t the only sector faring badly after early trade Monday in Europe, but they’re clearly in the firing line after the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to use tariffs so forcefully over the weekend. A decision on whether to impose tariffs on European autos is due on Saturday and the signs aren’t good, with the U.S. administration's action against China over the weekend showing no sign of accepting conventional wisdom that tariffs choke growth and leave consumers worse off.“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.All of Europe’s big carmakers are down over 1% this morning, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down 2.8%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) down 1.4%,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) down 1.7%, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) down 1.2% and BMW (DE:BMWG) down 1.1%.  Renault  (PA:RENA) is faring slightly better, down only 0.5% as a result of separate news of it making a formal merger proposal to Nissan (T:7201).The escalation of the trade war is hitting markets generally, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.7% at 374.86 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.1%, Germany’s Dax is down 0.9% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.The extent of the threat is best seen, however, in its impact throughout the supply chain. Parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) is at the bottom of the CAC 40, down 3.5%, tiremakers Continental (DE:CONG) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) are also down sharply, and even chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are being affected by the general malaise, due to their exposure to the auto sector.All that said, the sector may get a stay of execution. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that “there are signs that (the deadline) could be extended because of the talks between the U.S. and China.”“We’re prepared for the worst,” she added, noting that the EU has drawn up a list of U.S. products that would also have tariffs imposed on them if the U.S. goes ahead with its threat"

12,"May 06, 2019 04:17AM ET",StockBeat: Markets Tumble on Trump's China Threats,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Stocks are in retreat all across Europe on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump reignited fears of an all-out trade war between the U.S. and China.At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 5.34 points, or 1.4% at 385.02The French CAC 40 was the worst affected, losing 2.0%, while the German DAX was down 1.7%. The U.K. FTSE was closed due a public holiday.They’re all following the Chinese market, which had its worst one-day loss in three years after Trump revived threats of raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, as well as threatening to levy 25% tariffs on $325 billion more in Chinese goods previously unaffected by the dispute.Trump’s threats represent a serious and surprising blow to market morale, after weeks of guidance from both U.S. and Chinese officials that an agreement on trade between the two countries was likely. They came only 48 hours after the monthly U.S. employment report showed the U.S. economy still performing well, adding more jobs than expected without any noticeable pick-up in inflation.The U.S.-China angle is overshadowing domestic news. There was little reaction to the release of IHS Markit's Eurozone composite purchasing managers index, which showed that activity picked up marginally in April.Stocks sensitive to global trade are among the worst losers, with German chemicals company BASF (DE:BASFN) down over 7% (that's also due in part to its going ex-dividend) and French auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) down 4%. The big French and German automakers are all down, as is steelmaker ArcelorMittal, which announced sharp but notionally temporary cutbacks in European steel production earlier, citing the weak economic outlook, along with high electricity and carbon costs.And the resilient ones? Utilities are performing well, with Spain’s  Endesa  (MC:ELE) and  Red Electrica  (MC:REE), France’s Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Germany’s  E.On  (DE:EONGn) all outperforming local indices."

The complaint highlights ongoing disputes between tech companies and the car industry on royalties paid on technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and self-driving cars.Nokia (HE:NOKIA) was notified of the Bury, Continental and Valeo complaints at the same time that the Commission told the company of Daimler's complaint, a Nokia spokesman said.The EU competition enforcer confirmed Continental's complaint and said it was assessing this as well as those from Daimler and Bury.""The reason for this complaint is that we believe Nokia is not exercising fair practices regarding the licensing of their alleged standard essential patents,"" Continental said in a statement.Companies with key patents are expected to offer these on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.Valeo confirmed filing an EU complaint on the basis of abuse of a dominant position by Nokia.Nokia, which has a highly lucrative portfolio of patents inherited from the time when it was a leading mobile phone maker, said it had started talks with carmakers and their primary suppliers in 2015 on the use of its patents.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

23,"Apr 05, 2019 09:25AM ET",France preparing to fight activist funds: finance minister,nan,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - The French government is preparing measures to prevent activist funds destabilizing French companies, the country's finance minister told Reuters in an interview.Activist funds are increasingly active in Europe, buying up stakes in companies they feel are underperforming and pushing for changes in strategy to extract more value for shareholders. The practice has been common in the U.S. for many years but slower to take off in Europe as big stakes held by founding families or even the state proved a deterrent.In France, New York hedge fund Elliott Management is currently piling pressure on drinks giant  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), CIAM is tussling with reinsurer Scor, Amber Capital has acquired a stake in Lagardere and Searchlight Capital Partners said earlier this week it was investing in aeronautics company Latecoere. ""I am thinking about new national instruments that would make it possible to better resist activist funds,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters in Bucharest, where he was attending an EU finance ministers meeting.The plan would make it possible for the state to invest in companies it deemed to be of national interest, he said, declining to give further details other than saying the proposals would be ready in the coming months.""It's a subject I follow very closely because an activist fund that destroys value does not conform with the new capitalism I want to build,"" he added.Le Maire has championed an overhaul of French corporate law encouraging long-term investment and employee profit-sharing schemes. Parliament is due to vote on the legislation next week.Le Maire said there was a place for investment funds which helped improve a company's performance, but activist funds that destroyed longer-term value by trying to boost short-term profitability ""should be fought"".Elliott's campaign to improve profit margins and corporate governance at Pernod has fueled concerns that no company is immune.Not only does the group's founding family hold a large stake, it is generally considered to be well managed already.Last month, France's Bpifrance pubic investment bank said it had 2 billion euros available to fend off potential activist attacks on French firms if needed.Through the bank, the French government last week increased its stake in car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), which has previously been targeted by activist investors. Valeo also currently counts among its shareholders Chicago-based activist Harris Associates, which after Bpifrance's move said it supported management.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Apr 03, 2019 04:18AM ET","StockBeat - Trade, Brexit and PMIs Give Rally New Legs",nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- Europe’s stock markets are heading higher as surveys of the services sector in China and elsewhere raised hopes that the global economy is pulling out of the slowdown that began towards the end of 2018.News of a possible breakthrough in the Brexit process also supported sentiment, although the boost to the pound ensured that the FTSE 100 lagged its peers, gaining only 0.1% as of 04:15 AM ET (0815 GMT).The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 2.46 points, or 0.6% at 387.48, while the trade-sensitive German Dax led the way with a 1.2% gain.Asian markets had rallied overnight after the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to its highest level in 14 months. The mood was further improved by a Financial Times report suggesting that a trade deal between the U.S. and China is close (although the newspaper’s sources noted that the last 10% of any trade negotiation are the hardest).The big question of the day was therefore whether European services PMIs would make up for the shocking readings from manufacturing last week.They did: the Eurozone services PMI rose to 53.3 from 52.7 in March, beating expectations for an unchanged reading. The improvement was sharpest in  Italy, which has been under a cloud this week after the OECD slashed its growth forecast for the year and issued a dire warning about its debt trajectory. But readings also improved in Germany and France, even if the latter wasn’t enough to bring the composite French PMI above the 50 line that would represent growth.China-sensitive auto and supplier stocks appear to be getting the most uplift from the data, with French suppliers  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) leading the CAC 40. German rivals Hella (DE:HLE) and Continental (DE:CONG) are likewise outperforming the big local auto brands.Banks stocks - especially in Spain - are also picking up as the outlook for the economy brightens a bit. Santander (MC:SAN) is up 1.7%, after unveiling another 1.2 billion euros of planned cost cuts. The bank is under pressure to move on from an embarrassing aborted attempt to hire UBS investment bank chief Andrea Orcel as CEO."

The less good news is it takes time for credit easing impact the domestic and global economies,"" said Nicholas Brooks, head of economic and investment research at Intermediate Capital Group. ""We think Europe will see growth pick up in the latter part of 2019 as China import demand stabilises and recent exceptional domestic factors weighing on Europe growth start to fade.""Auto stocks fell after German bearings maker Schaeffler warned of an ""extremely challenging"" business environment in 2019 and said it would restructure, sending its shares down 10.8 percent.""The midpoint of the new guidance implies 17 percent consensus earnings (EBIT) downgrades, and the 2020 guidance elimination will likely hurt sentiment,"" said UBS analysts.

Traders said the stocks were also hurt by an article in Handelsblatt saying the European Commission is preparing fines on German carmakers in an ongoing antitrust investigation. Carmaker shares, facing a potent cocktail of slowing global growth and rising trade tariffs, have been under pressure for months. French car suppliers Faurecia and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) also fell 1.4 to 2.9 percent while small-cap Swiss autos supplier Autoneum fell 9.3 percent after reporting a drop in profitability.Results from the tech sector were more encouraging.Logitech shares rose 1.4 percent to a four-month high after the chipmaker said it expects annual sales to increase by mid to high single-digit in the next financial year ending March 2020.""Delivering on its medium term targets is not fully reflected in shares yet,"" UBS analysts said. Dialog Semiconductor shares jumped 8.6 percent after the Anglo-German chip designer said revenue would suffer a single-digit percentage drop this year as it reduces its exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), above analysts' consensus view.

Luxury rivals  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH also rose 0.6 percent each.Swedish electronics group Dometic shone, topping the STOXX with a 16-percent jump after reporting fourth-quarter profit rose and giving a positive outlook for 2019 sales growth.On the flipside, Belgian chemicals and cobalt refiner Umicore fell 4.7 percent after saying it expected 2019 growth to be hit by subdued demand in cars and consumer electronics, and R&D costs.Construction was a weak spot with Denmark's Rockwool sinking 13 percent after full-year earnings missed expectations, and Sweden's Skanska losing 7.8 percent after it cut its dividend and lagged profit estimates.Autos fell 0.8 percent, extending losses from Thursday when the sector suffered its biggest one-day drop since the Brexit vote aftermath in June 2016.Tata Motors warned Jaguar Land Rover would swing to a loss due to weak sales, and that latest negative news on car demand weighed on auto suppliers  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Faurecia, down 2.6 to 3 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Another drop in German industrial output, out Thursday, is consistent with that, but it’s  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which announced a big recall of Dodge Ram trucks Wednesday (and which reports fourth-quarter earnings later today), that’s the biggest loser.At 05:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT) the Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 23 points, or 0.7%, at 3189.65.Those lower down the auto food chain are also suffering. Osram Licht AG (DE:OSRn) – the Siemens lighting spin-off that is a big supplier to the auto industry – said it swung to a loss in the three months to December thanks to the slowdown in China, and in automotive in particular. That's weighing on other suppliers such as Continental (DE:CONG) and Covestro (DE:1COV) in Germany, and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France.Travel companies are again making negative headlines: Tui AG NA (DE:TUIGn) fell over 16% after missing its 2018 profit target and saying that 2019 margins look weaker. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook (LON:TCG), which lost over 75% last year, rose after saying it’s looking at selling its airline business, and Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) confirmed a $257 million loss last year after a 71% rise in its fuel costs.The good news is coming, again, from the energy and the food and drink sectors.  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP), maker of Jameson’s whiskey and Martell cognac, followed  Diageo  (LON:DGE) in reporting strong fourth-quarter numbers and predicting a robust 2019. And French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) reported a record year for output and beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit, but its shares edged down slightly.Italy’s bombed-out banks are also having a strong morning after Unicredit (MI:CRDI) posted its highest annual profit in a decade – despite the headwinds from its operations in Turkey and its home market. Rivals  Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA (MI:ISP) also reported stronger-than-expected numbers Wednesday."

Valeo  (PA:VLOF) dropped 6.4 percent, the biggest faller on the CAC 40, while Continental (DE:CONG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were among the biggest DAX decliners.Still in the first full trading week of 2019, the STOXX 600 gained 1.7 percent as investors regained their appetite for risk boosted by dovish comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.Equity funds drew inflows of $6.2 billion, the biggest in 11 weeks, BAML said. The FTSE 100 (FTSE) erased earlier gains as sterling bounced amid growing expectations that the government may delay its departure from the European Union beyond March 29. [FRX/]Focus remained on Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get her Brexit deal through parliament, with a crucial vote due on Tuesday. A drastic about-turn in crude prices also weighed on heavyweight oil stocks (SXEP).In the healthcare sector, downgrades by Jefferies hit UDG Healthcare (L:UDG) and Orion Oyj (HE:ORNBV) which were the worst individual performers with falls of 7.7 percent 7.4 percent respectively. French utilities took a hit after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) downgraded ratings on Suez (PA:SEVI) and Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE), citing doubts about the global growth outlook. The stocks were down 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.The UK's housebuilders were stand-out gainers on the day after BAML upgraded its view on the sector, saying ""it seems at least possible, or even probably, that some sort of Brexit resolution is within sight and therefore the UK housebuilding sector may see some relief"". Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and  Persimmon  (L:PSN) were leading British blue chips, both rising more than 4 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) was down 0.8 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) lost 0.7 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell 0.5 percent. The falls snapped Europe's two-day rally which had taken it up to three-week highs.German lighting company Osram (DE:OSRn) was the biggest faller on the STOXX, down 7.2 percent after its CEO warned it suffered a weaker than expected final quarter of 2018 as auto demand slowed sharply.The latest sign of weakness in the auto sector bruised car parts makers  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), losing 4.7 and 3.4 percent, and tyre maker Continental (DE:CONG) down 2.9 percent. Italian carmaker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) fell for different reasons: sources said it would pay more than $700 million to resolve lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department over claims it used illegal software to allow diesel vehicles to emit excess emissions.Autos (SXAP) were the worst-performing, down 1.6 percent.Also among top fallers was Scout24 (DE:G24n), down 4.8 percent with traders citing a DealReporter article saying the online listings firm's talks with private equity over a potential buyout have stalled. In the UK, updates from retailers including Marks & Spencer,  Tesco , B&M, and Halfords dominated with many adding to signs of a challenging Christmas due to poor consumer confidence.Cycling and car parts retailer Halfords (L:HFD) sank 23.2 percent to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after a profit warning.Tesco (L:TSCO) was a silver lining, rising 2.3 percent to the top of the FTSE 100 after its Christmas trading came in better than peers with a 2.2 percent increase in sales.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

91,"Nov 30, 2018 05:03AM ET",Autos and miners drag Europe down as weak China and trade fears sap confidence,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Friday as weak data from China rekindled anxiety over slowing growth and investors fretted ahead of Saturday's crucial G20 talks between U.S. President Trump and China's Xi Jinping over trade.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) opened marginally up but rapidly fell into negative territory, down 0.5 percent by 0930 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI), the most sensitive to China due to its big exporters, fell 0.6 percent. The DAX was set for its fourth straight month of losses - its longest losing streak since 2008. The pan-European STOXX was set for its second straight month of losses as November, and a disappointing earnings season, draw to a close.Investors' hopes of a partial recovery in stock markets in December - known as a ""Santa rally"" - hang on the leaders' discussions resulting in a truce or de-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.""There are only two people in the world that can deliver a Santa rally, Trump and Xi, and I don't see that happening,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Garnry saw a 60 to 65 percent chance of the Trump-Xi talks resulting in ""no deal"".China reported its weakest factory growth in more than two years on Friday, reigniting fears about growth ahead of crucial trade talks.""The weak data out of China is increasingly a little bit of a surprise. Most investors would have anticipated that at least some of that stimulus six months ago would have had an impact, but this really tells us how big the headwinds are,"" said Garnry.Autos stocks (SXAP) were the worst-performing, down 1.4 percent, on the data and anxiety over tariffs.German car bosses are finalizing plans to visit the White House next week to discuss trade policy, German and U.S. officials said.Car parts makers were among the worst-performing stocks, with Hella (DE:HLE),  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), and tire maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) down 2.4 to 4.9 percent. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) dragged the DAX down with a 2.7 percent fall, while peers BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 0.8 to 0.9 percent. ""The problem with Europe is that... quite a lot of our industrial supply chain and capital goods manufacturers have at least some exposure to the autos sector, so you can't get away from it,"" said Ian Ormiston, European smaller companies fund manager at Merian Global Investors. HSBC analysts downgraded both Faurecia and Daimler to ""reduce"" from ""hold"", saying a re-rating for the sector next year is ""hard to imagine"". Tariff fears have led analysts to slash their earnings growth forecasts for the sector.Mining stocks (SXPP) fell 1.1 percent, hit by growth fears over China, the world's top metals consumer.Among the biggest drags on the STOXX were also luxury goods conglomerates  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), down 1.8 percent each. Luxury stocks have been especially sensitive to slowing growth in China, high-end brands' biggest market. In single-stock moves Altice (AS:ATCA) shares surged 9.4 percent after the telecoms and cable firm announced its French unit had agreed to sell a 49.99 percent stake in its fiber optic business.Zalando (DE:ZALG) fell 4.2 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its price target on the stock, saying it has become more skeptical about the long-term potential for margins at the online retailer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

102,"Nov 12, 2018 02:10AM ET",Disappointing third-quarter earnings another blow to battered European market,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European companies are delivering their most disappointing earnings in nearly three years as a sluggish economy and rising costs take their toll on bottom lines, dealing another blow to investor confidence shaken by Italy's budget crisis and Brexit.Stocks have seen sharp swings on results days as firms reveal the damage wrought by higher trade tariffs and weaker global demand against a backdrop of sliding equity markets and rising volatility.Some of Europe's biggest companies, from cement makers and car manufacturers to engineering firms and airlines, warned of weaker margins.""Macro momentum did roll over more than people had anticipated and I think that is coming through in the (earnings) numbers,"" said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. The rate of earnings beats so far this earnings season is its weakest since the fourth quarter 2015 results, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows.Many investors had hoped a solid corporate earnings season would help offset a slew of political and macro economic challenges across the region from Rome's budget crisis to London's struggle to clinch a Brexit deal. The STOXX 600 is on track for its worst year since 2011. But analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the STOXX 600 at their fastest pace since July 2016. Downgrades started well before the earnings season even started three weeks ago, suggesting that confidence was already low. ""The biggest reason why the Q3 earnings season has felt weaker than usual is the absence of very good results rather than significantly more big misses than usual,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts.Earnings on the STOXX 600 are expected to grow 15.8 percent in the third quarter year-on-year, and are on track for 8.4 percent earnings growth for the full year 2018. That compares to earnings growth of 12.2 percent for 2017. But this season companies have also struggled with higher costs: raw materials, fuel prices and wages have all climbed while trade tariffs piled extra inflationary pressure onto some firms.Examples abound.The world's largest cement maker LafargeHolcim (S:LHN) cut its profit expectations due to rising fuel and transport costs.Slowing growth and higher costs hurt autos in particular, with European companies reliant on growth in China, the world's top car market.Carmakers including  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) had cut profit outlooks ahead of results due to trade tariffs and slowing Chinese demand.But negative surprises during this season then came from their suppliers, the auto parts manufacturers including  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Nokian , and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), also suffering from weaker sales growth.SHARP SHARE REACTIONSVolatility in equity markets globally is shifting up a gear and a sharp worldwide sell-off right at the start of the earnings season certainly didn't help sentiment.Outsized share moves continued into this quarter, with a distinct negative skew to investors' reactions to companies delivering disappointing earnings while in-line or modestly positive results have not been rewarded in kind.On Thursday, shares in ProSiebensat (DE:PSMGn) sank 15 percent to its lowest in more than six years after the German broadcaster said it would pay out less of its earnings to shareholdersMeanwhile  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) shares the same day rose just 0.7 percent even after the German engineering company's results beat expectations.Stocks that missed consensus EPS estimates have seen the worst performance of the last four quarters, according to UBS. Earnings-day moves in Europe are averaging +/- 4 percent, against the typical average of +/- 3.1 percent since 2003, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said.LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL?Despite underwhelming earnings this season, some investors see the seeds of a recovery for Europe into the year-end and next year - partly off the back of a pullback in U.S. stocks which investors piled into this year.Quarterly earnings growth is expected to be stronger in Europe than the United States next year, putting the region back on the radar for investors hungry for growth.""When one looks at long-term charts and relative outperformance of the U.S. versus Europe and profit margins, you would say on a five-year view you would expect these to begin to converge,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.""The necessary triggers you'd have to see are PMI figures picking back up and signs the Italy-Brussels negotiations are at least in a steady state as opposed to going haywire,"" he added.If trade war concerns have peaked and the United States and China arrive at a compromise, the euro area economy highly geared to global trade may get a boost, and inflows could follow.""Expectations are so low on European growth that it could just surprise next year,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.""The outlook for next year in terms of fund flows is much more exciting in world ex-US than it is in US,"" he added, saying he favors emerging markets and Europe.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The leading index of euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) fell 1.5 percent with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 1.7 percent and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) down 1.8 percent.

Disappointing Amazon and Alphabet results reignited investors' anxieties about the overwhelming dominance of tech stocks - prized for seemingly unstoppable growth - in this market cycle.The pan-European STOXX 600 was on track for its worst month since August 2015.On the day earnings disappointments caused sharp falls. Shares in French auto parts maker Valeo (PA:VLOF) sank more than 19 percent after its second profit warning in three months, flagging disruption from tougher European emissions tests and a sharp sales downturn in China.Peer  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) also tumbled 9.2 percent after it announced an agreement to buy Japanese car navigation system maker Clarion from Hitachi.Altran (PA:ALTT) shares surged 16 percent after the engineering and tech consultancy reported strong third-quarter results. Swedish appliances maker Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) sank 13.5 percent after it trimmed its market demand expectations and forecast higher costs due to increasing raw material prices and tariffs.Shares in French household appliances maker SEB (PA:SEBF) also fell 15.3 percent after its third-quarter sales figures.Results from banks were more mixed after more encouraging results from UBS had boosted it in the previous session.Spain's Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE) topped the IBEX with a 5.5 percent gain after its third-quarter profit beat expectations. Britain's RBS (L:RBS) meanwhile tumbled 4 percent after it warned of economic uncertainty and its profit lagged forecasts. The lender said it had taken a 100 million pound impairment provision to account for greater uncertainty.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

119,"Oct 01, 2018 12:51PM ET",Electric cars cast growing shadow on profits,nan,"By Laurence FrostPARIS (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers. Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit.Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge.But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals.""What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it's more expensive,"" said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of  Peugeot , Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA.A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (DE:BMWG), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was ""a first alarm signal"", Tavares said in a weekend radio interview.""Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.""Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party's annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday.On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros.PRICED TO PUSHAfter declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2.Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off.Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand's electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact.""VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,"" said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners.""Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,"" he said. ""Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.""Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. ""We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,"" a spokesman said.Volkswagen and Mercedes parent  Daimler , which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough.They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years.COST GAPElectric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros.When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold.Mass-market electrics such as the  Renault  (PA:RENA) Zoe and Nissan (T:7201) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (O:TSLA) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall.Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner.Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla's $49,000 Model 3.""It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,"" said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. ""Demand doesn't justify investment at all - it's all regulation.""Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors' and customers' benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region's 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs.""The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren't met, and consumers just aren't ready for full-electric,"" ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently.Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed.""We've taken risks as a company,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), a major manufacturer of electrification components and systems. ""We have invested a lot even though the market doesn't exist.""SCALE EFFECTSCarmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand.Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car's value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise.Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen.Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government's 4,500 pound plug-in incentive.French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold.""We don't launch vehicles with negative operating margins,"" Salvat said.German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans.That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind.""In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,"" BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters.""If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.""($1 = 0.7675 pounds) Shortfall of planned European battery supply for electric vehicles (EV) https://tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOXGlobal electric-battery vehicle sales. https://tmsnrt.rs/2oDPjG4^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

120,"Oct 01, 2018 09:30AM ET",Ex-Apple engineers show their startup's self-driving car sensor,nan,"By Stephen NellisSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers on Monday gave new details about the sensor system their startup company, Aeva Inc, is making to help self-driving cars see the world around them.Aeva was founded by Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk, who both left Apple's Special Projects Group that houses the iPhone maker's self-driving car work. Aeva is working on a device that would help cars sense the road, vehicles, pedestrians and other surroundings several hundred yards ahead. It would be a critical link in self-driving technology including software and controls made by others. At a San Francisco warehouse last week, Aeva's device was mounted on a white Audi sport-utility vehicle parked on a mock road. In real time, it captured images of Aeva workers whizzing about on kick-scooters, with the workers' images changing color as they moved toward or away from the vehicle.In other self-driving car systems, such data comes from separate sensors from different suppliers. Radar measures speed, so-called ""lidar"" measures depth and standard cameras capture digital images the car's computer can analyze. The streams must be blended in a step called ""sensor fusion.""Aeva aims to combine those functions in one device and skip the external ""fusion"" step. Its device has sensors for motion, depth, speed and reflected light and contains an artificial intelligence chip that weaves it together.""Because we've created this technology from the ground up, we have unique access to the data from deep inside the hardware,"" Salehian told Reuters in an interview.Aeva enters a crowded field of sensor firms selling to automakers. One of Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) new Audi sedans features a laser scanner from  Valeo  (PA:VLOF). BMW Group has paired with Israeli startup Innoviz Technologies around a new sensor. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co invested $75 million in longtime lidar maker Velodyne.Established firms have the most sensors on the road right now, said Angelos Lakrintis, an autonomous vehicles analyst with Strategy Analytics. But ""there is still some time"" for newcomers to win over automakers because self-driving cars will not hit roads en masse until the mid-2020s, he said.Automakers are sensitive to cost. Some depth sensors use pricey bespoke laser chips. Aeva would not reveal what chips it uses or its final costs but said it has avoided expensive parts.""We do not need high-powered lasers anymore,"" Rezk told Reuters. ""We're using laser sources and sensors that are already in mass manufacturing.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

130,"Aug 30, 2018 08:40AM ET",Half of VW models in Germany not compliant with new pollution standard,nan,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said only half of its VW branded passenger car models in Germany are compliant with a new pollution standard, thanks to a much tougher emissions testing regime. Cars in the European Union must comply with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) from September, but Volkswagen has only gained regulatory clearance for seven of its 14 main model lines.""The new tests are more cumbersome and take two to three times longer than in the past, even limited edition models need to be tested separately,"" Volkswagen's Thomas Zahn said in a call with journalists on Thursday.""The coming months will be challenging for us,"" said Zahn, head of sales and marketing for Volkswagen passenger cars.Volkswagen's top-selling Golf model is among the vehicles still waiting to be cleared by authorities, Zahn said.He said he expected the Golf to pass the WLTP standards by the end of September.Shipments of cars are expected to slow down in September and October, but pick up again in the final two months of the year.""We expect very strong deliveries in December,"" Zahn said.Carmakers including Daimler, Volkswagen and supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) have cut profit expectations, blaming a slowdown in global sales triggered in part by delays getting vehicles certified to the new standard.Analysts at Evercore ISI said the WLTP delays at the VW brand appear to be under control since the carmaker has not resorted to heavy discounting to keep sales flowing. Nonetheless delays will cause profitability of the brand to drop to around 2 percent in the third quarter, from 5.5 percent in the second quarter, Evercore said in a note on Thursday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

134,"Aug 23, 2018 05:04AM ET","European shares edge higher as defensives rise, trade tariffs dent autos",nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged up on Thursday after the latest round of U.S.-China tariffs kicked in, hurting trade-sensitive autos stocks but boosting demand for sectors seen as more insulated from an escalating trade dispute.The STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 0.3 percent, buoyed by tech, healthcare, and consumer staples stocks - ""defensives"" which investors reach for as safer bets in times of uncertainty for their strong earnings growth and high dividend payouts.The United States and China implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods on Thursday, bringing to $50 billion the value of imports subjected to tariffs on either side since early July, with more in the pipeline.Autos (SXAP) stocks were the worst-performing for a second day. On Wednesday a surprise profit warning from tire maker Continental sank the stock and hit the sector, already one of the worst impacted by tariff fears.Continental (DE:CONG) fell a further 1.5 percent, bottom of the DAX, taking its losses to 15 percent since Wednesday's open.Carmakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 0.8 to 1.1 percent, while  Valeo  (PA:VLOF),  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) were the biggest CAC 40 fallers.Overall shares continued to move in a range, in a trend that is unsettling some investors concerned about complacency in the market. ""We have not witnessed (or not yet) a sudden evaporation of risk appetite, as happened, for example, after the summer of 2015, the last time that the health of the world economy was truly in debate,"" said ODDO BHF economists. ""Corrections and turbulence in recent months and weeks have been fairly localized in both space and time.""Strong earnings growth is part of what is preserving the market. With the second-quarter results season tailing off, MSCI Europe firms have reported 10.9 percent year-on-year earnings growth.Outside trade war moves, shares in budget airline Ryanair (I:RYA) jumped 6.3 percent to the top of the STOXX after the Irish pilots' union Forsa said it had reached an agreement in a labor dispute.Shares in Swiss asset manager GAM (S:GAMH) fell 3.7 percent, the biggest decline on the STOXX 600. The stock is down 22 percent since July 31, when it suspended a director, halting dealing in some bond funds soon afterwards.Austria's Raiffeisen Bank (VI:RBIV), which operates across eastern Europe and has been in the firing line as new U.S. sanctions on Russia develop, fell 2.5 percent. Shares in Danish medical equipment, supplies and distribution company Ambu (CO:AMBUb) recovered swiftly from a 10 percent drop at the open after its third-quarter results missed analysts' targets. Swiss telecoms group Sunrise Communications (S:SRCG) rose 6.5 percent after it increased its guidance for full-year 2018 EBITDA.Building materials firm CRH (I:CRH) pared early gains to trade up just 1.1 percent after reporting first-half margins held steady and striking a positive tone for earnings in the second half of the year. Some analysts pointed to weaker cash flow. ""The slight EBITDA beat versus consensus is offset by weak operating cash generation,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

140,"Aug 02, 2018 07:32AM ET",BMW beats second-quarter forecasts as new anti pollution rules dent rivals,nan,"By Edward TaylorFRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) reported a smaller-than-expected 6 percent decline in second quarter operating profit on Thursday while brushing off concerns about new anti-pollution rules and global trade tensions which caused rival  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) to warn on profits.The German carmaker said higher spending to develop electric and autonomous cars and currency headwinds weighed on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which fell to 2.74 billion euros ($3.19 billion) but topped the 2.69 billion expected by analysts.""At times when others are struggling, they are rock solid, and they don't seem to have an issue with WLTP,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said, referring to the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure.Evercore, which holds an 'in-line' rating on BMW, said the results were solid if unspectacular, while rivals Volkswagen and Mercedes had struck a more cautious tone. BMW's automotive EBIT margin narrowed to 8.6 percent from 10.1 percent a year earlier while vehicle deliveries rose 0.7 percent.Adjusted for comparability, BMW's automotive margin came in at 9.3 percent versus 9.2 percent for Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi brand and 9.6 percent for Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Evercore said.BMW shares were down 1.2 percent at 1113 GMT.The company expects capital expenditure to reach an all-time high in 2018, it said, as the company continues high levels of spending to develop electric and autonomous cars. BMW will open a battery cell competence center with expertise in developing and producing battery cells in early 2019.""We will also be purchasing raw materials for battery cells ourselves, especially cobalt, in the future,"" Chief Executive Harald Krueger told investors on a call to discuss earnings. WLTPBMW affirmed its 2018 targets to achieve slightly higher deliveries and revenue in the automotive segment and achieve a group profit before taxes at the previous year's level.Mercedes-Benz and VW have both warned that problems certifying their vehicles to the WLTP standard would result in a more limited product offering, potentially damaging margins, BMW has largely completed converting its fleet. ""We see some advantages when compared with our competitors,"" Krueger said, explaining that most of BMW's models had received road worthiness certification and that waiting times were no longer than three months.While BMW said it has most of its fleet available for sale, Volkswagen said only 60 percent of its VW brand fleet will have met emissions tests by end August.BMW also said increased efficiency measures had helped offset a triple-digit million euro headwind from foreign exchange rates and raw materials.TARIFFSBecause BMW earlier this year stopped exporting its X3 offroader from Spartanburg, South Carolina, to China it has been able to avoid a 40 percent import tariff, imposed since July, while rivals such as Mercedes still export large SUVs from the United States.Demand for new models like the large X7 sports utility vehicle are so high that BMW is confident it can adjust prices to still make a profit on cars exported from the United States to China. It has already raised prices on its X5 and X6 models and is building some X5 models in Thailand for export to China, the company said. Tariffs were introduced as part of a broader trade dispute as the United States seeks to ""rebalance"" trade relationships with the European Union and China. These tariffs will have a low to midsize triple-digit million euros impact, Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said. This may force carmakers to retool their production networks to curb inter-continental exports and to serve regional trading blocs instead. BMW has already announced an expansion of its product capacity in China and Europe this year.Krueger said he had met British Prime Minister Theresa May to underscore the need for Britain to maintain trading ties to the European Union.""I explained this complex situation to her and what business preconditions we need. Britain should stay in the customs union,"" Krueger told journalists on a call. Daimler,  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and General Motors (N:GM) and supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) all blamed trade tensions for lowering their profit forecasts for the year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

142,"Aug 01, 2018 08:01AM ET",Skills shortage makes it harder for VW to meet new rules of the road,nan,"By Edward Taylor and Jan SchwartzWOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) warned that a shortage of engineers is hampering efforts to get its cars to meet new anti-pollution rules, clouding its sales outlook and overshadowing a forecast-beating 23 percent rise in underlying operating profit.VW has seen a raft of engine experts depart since admitting to systematic emissions cheating in Sept. 2015. That has left the carmaker short of engineers now needed to work on models complying with stricter emissions tests, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said on Wednesday.""Engine development expertise has been lost,"" said Diess, explaining that getting engines certified for road use has become a lot harder under a new Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure, known as WLTP, that takes effect from September.The carmaker last week poached BMW engine development expert Markus Duesmann to help overcome the problem, but warned that delays in getting road certification will result in bottlenecks for certain model variants between August and October.""That impacts capacity utilization at our plants, so there will be closure days at our sites during this period,"" Diess said. Although VW is sticking to its delivery targets, meeting them will be hard.""One thing is clear, though: this will be a titanic task for the second half of the year, particularly on the margin side,"" said Diess, who was promoted to the top job in April after running the VW brand.In a press conference on Wednesday to discuss second-quarterresults, Diess said the changeover to the WLTP testprocedure poses, ""The biggest volume and earnings risk forVolkswagen.""Volkswagen shares were down 1.3 percent at 1145 GMT.The introduction of WLTP rules was accelerated in the wake of Volkswagen's diesel cheating. Regulators now take a much more granular look at vehicles and test car pollution levels much more comprehensively, Diess said.""They look at what kind of tyres were fitted and whether the air conditioning is switched on,"" Diess explained. In June, VW warned that production of up to 250,000 cars will be delayed because of WLTP and said last month it wouldbe renting parking spaces to stockpile vehicles that cannot be sold.DIESELGATE COSTRival carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) cut their outlooks citing the introduction of new stringent emissions standards and a slowdown in growth as a trade war and tariffs hamper global trade.Automakers General Motors Co (N:GM), Ford Motor (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) lowered their full-year profit forecasts last week due to escalating tariffs.Although its sales have held up, Volkswagen is still suffering the financial consequences of the ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal almost three years since it broke.The scandal has cost the carmaker 27.4 billion euros so far and second-quarter earnings took a 1.6 billion euros hit to cover a fine and legal expenses, it said.A 5.5 percent rise in vehicle sales helped lift second-quarter operating profit before special items to 5.58 billion euros from 4.55 billion a year-earlier, compared with analyst consensus for 4.98 billion in a Reuters poll.After special items, group operating profit dropped by 13 percent to 3.95 billion euros.""These are solid numbers despite the legal expenses,"" NordLB analyst Frank Schwope, who has a ""Buy"" rating on VW, said on Wednesday.Despite confirming its outlook for a full-year adjusted operating margin of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent, Volkswagen warned that sticking to its financial targets will be a challenge.After special items, VW said it anticipates that its operating return on sales will fall ""moderately short.""In the wake of its emissions scandal, Volkswagen accelerated a push to expand its portfolio of electric cars. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said it could start serial production of solid-state battery cells from 2024 or 2025. ""We must not make ourselves dependent on a few Asian manufacturers in the long term,"" Diess said, explaining that advances in ceramic separators had raised the viability of mass production. A solid state battery factory would likely be in Europe, or even in Germany under the right conditions, Diess said."

""Simulation technology can help greatly reduce autonomous vehicle testing costs for carmakers,"" Cognata Chief Executive Officer Danny Atsmon told Reuters.The AID-Cognata deal comes at a time when Israel's defense technology, which has helped its military drive tanks, guide and intercept missiles, and keep its computer systems secure, is being redeployed in the development of driverless cars.Israeli auto tech startups raised $814 million last year, only slightly behind the $1.2 billion raised by U.S. firms. (https://reut.rs/2Iqe3cg)U.S. chipmaker Intel (O:INTC), German auto supplier Continental (DE:CONG), Samsung (KS:005930),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and GM (N:GM) are among companies that have bought startups or are setting up their own development centers in Israel.Cognata, which competes with firms including Redwood City, California-based Metamoto, had raised a total of $5 million as of the last funding round in 2017. The startup's investors include Maniv Mobility - a car technology fund backed by Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) and French auto parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) - planemaker Airbus' venture capital fund Airbus Ventures and Tel-Aviv based early-stage venture capital firm Emerge.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

155,"Jun 21, 2018 05:33AM ET",European autos sink on Daimler tariff hit while markets wilt,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Autos stocks slammed the brakes on a relief bounce in European shares on Thursday, sinking after German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) warned profit would be hit by higher tariffs.The autos sector fell 2.3 percent to a nine-month low while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) eased down 0.2 percent as no new salvos were exchanged in an ongoing U.S.-China trade spat.Equity markets have been relatively resilient in the face of mounting trade concerns but fell broadly this week as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Daimler became one of the biggest global companies to cut its guidance on trade tensions, warning profits would be hit in part by Chinese tariffs on car imports from the United States.Daimler (DE:DAIGn) shares fell 4.4 percent to their lowest in nearly two years. Some analysts were skeptical of Daimler's timing, saying the profit warning may be more driven by internal pressures than the external trade environment. But UBS analysts said they expected consensus earnings estimate downgrades of 5 to 7 percent for the carmaker. BMW (DE:BMWG) fell 3 percent and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 2.3 percent. Tyre maker Continental (DE:CONG) declined 1.6 percent. France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) fell 1.3 percent, while auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) declined 0.5 percent. Italy's Fiat Chrysler  lost 1.8 percent. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) underperformed peers down 0.5 percent due to the carmakers' losses. Financials stocks were the biggest weight on the STOXX after two leading eurosceptics from the far-right League were named to head Italian parliamentary finance committees.Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) fell 1.3 percent, underperforming European peers as bank stocks (FTIT8300) tumbled, while Italian bond yields rose as the appointments reignited investors' fears around Italy's new populist government.University professor Alberto Bagnai, who was named head of the Finance Committee in the Senate, published “Il tramonto dell’euro” (“The sunset of the euro”) in 2012.Despite Daimler's comments, some investors saw trade war fears as a chance to buy stocks at slightly cheaper prices.""We're actually looking at it as an opportunity to add some risk back into portfolios and use some of the cash that we built up,"" said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management. ""It's really been consumer discretionary and autos in particular that have been hit so far by concerns about trade wars but actually the underlying drivers of the market - tech, energy, healthcare, have been really strong,"" he added. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index had a record high close on Wall Street on Wednesday.Healthcare stocks were the top boost to European indices as  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) jumped 4.4 percent to the top of the STOXX after the pharma company announced PIONEER-4 and PIONEER-7 trial results for its experimental diabetes pill. ""Both trials delivered in terms of glucose control as well as weight loss regardless of the statistical analysis,"" said UBS analysts. Consumer staples stocks such as  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), ABInBev (BR:ABI) and Nestle (S:NESN) also provided support. The dollar earners have benefited from the recent strength in the dollar.To view a graphic on German auto stocks falling, click: https://reut.rs/2MJ0zff  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It also invested in Sinovation Ventures, itself a Chinese fund focused on artificial intelligence, and has made a decision to invest in Israel's Maniv Mobility, another car technology fund also backed by Jaguar Land Rover and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF).""We think this is a good way for us to better understand the Israeli ecosystem ... where we see big potential,"" Dossa, a former banker, said, adding it was ""a question of probably days,"" until the deal with Maniv is signed.He declined to provide details of the sixth investment that has not yet been approved.Alliance Ventures is seeking investments in new mobility, vehicle connectivity, autonomous driving, enterprise technology and energy, including electric vehicles and batteries.It works closely with the alliance's innovation labs, including one it has at Tel Aviv University for co-development and testing of Israeli technologies.Alliance Ventures is 40 percent held by  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), 40 percent by Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and 20 percent by Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211).The fund's goal is strategic - to find technologies that will be part of new mobility services in the future, Dossa said.

168,"Mar 05, 2018 03:10PM ET",Exclusive: Fiat Chrysler to spin-off Magneti Marelli without raising money - sources,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Arno Schuetze and Agnieszka Flak LONDON/FRANKFURT/MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is looking to spin off auto-parts business Magneti Marelli to its shareholders via a Milan listing that will not raise money by selling new shares, four sources familiar with the matter said.Under the deal, which is aimed at giving Magneti Marelli more flexibility - including to raise money in future - FCA investors will get shares in the parts maker in proportion to their existing FCA holding, the sources said. Advisers initially looked at a possible initial public offering for the 99-year old parts business to raise cash to cut FCA's debt, but the Agnelli family - FCA's main shareholder - were put off by low industry valuations and did not want their stake in Magneti Marelli to be diluted, three of the sources said. ""At this stage it's not worth going down the IPO route,"" said one of them. ""Other than trimming FCA's debt, a listing will not bring any immediate benefit to FCA investors.""The move could be announced by FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne, who carved out and listed luxury sports car maker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) in 2015, when he unveils his new strategy plan on June 1, the sources said.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have been appointed to spin off Magneti Marelli alongside law firms Sullivan & Cromwell in the United States and Legance in Italy, the sources said.The business, which sits within FCA's components unit alongside robotics specialist Comau and castings firm Teksid, could be worth between 3.6 and 5 billion euros ($4.4-6.2 billion), analysts say.But it would likely trade at a discount to peers including Germany's Hella (DE:HLE) and French parts makers  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), they add.The Agnellis own 29 percent of FCA through their holding vehicle Exor (MI:EXOR).FCA, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Legance declined to comment, while Sullivan & Cromwell was not immediately available for comment.FCA said on Feb. 28 its board would review a possible spin-off of Magneti Marelli in the second quarter, after Marchionne said he wanted to ""purify"" FCA's portfolio.The sources said the Italian-American carmaker had so far held back from sounding out possible bidders for the unit as it didn't want any distractions to the planned demerger this year.But the spin-off may face some hurdles, as some investment funds that hold FCA stock may not want to hold onto Magneti Marelli shares, one of the sources said. This source said some funds may be restricted by investment guidelines allowing them to invest only in global players such as FCA, and not in a medium-sized Italian supplier.After the spin-off, FCA will focus on finding a new owner for Comau, but it wants to keep full control of Teksid, the sources said.Magneti Marelli, which employs around 43,000 people and operates in 19 countries, is a diversified components supplier specialised in lighting, powertrain and electronics.It had revenue of around 8.7 billion euros in 2017, according to analysts, and adjusted core earnings of around 840 million euros.Magneti Marelli has often been touted as a takeover target and FCA has fielded interest from various rivals and private equity firms over the years.South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) made a bid approach in 2016 but negotiations fell through as it was only interested in parts of the components maker, sources have said.FCA has yet to appoint advisers on Comau, which has 15 manufacturing plants and 35 operational centers around the world and has already drawn interest from Chinese and Asian buyers, one of the sources said. The source pointed to the sale of German robotics maker Kuka to China's Midea in 2016.Reuters reported that Shanghai Electric, Sinomach and Shanghai Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (Simee) were among Chinese firms eyeing bids for Comau in 2016.

""It's taken a while but after many false dawns over the past decade, RBS has finally managed to return an annual profit, albeit a minor one... and for that we can thank the fact that the bank hasn't settled its outstanding dispute with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.French auto parts maker Valeo (PA:VLOF) slumped 9 percent to a six-month low, making it the biggest faller on the STOXX 600 (STOXX). Its second-half profit fell on adverse exchange rates and raw materials prices, prompting UBS to cut its price target on the stock The STOXX was up 0.06 percent by 0936 GMT. Among country indicators, the UK's FTSE (FTSE) dipped 0.2 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up 0.06 percent. The STOXX is on course to end the week flat as markets stabilize and volatility calms following a turbulent start of the month that sent the index to a near-six-month low. It has since risen 3.5 percent from that level.Elsewhere among financials,  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) rose 1 percent after agreeing to sell the bulk of its insurance business to Phoenix Group (L:PHNX) for 3.24 billion pounds, while Swiss RE rose 2.1 percent after reporting better than expected 2017 net income.Oil services firm  Subsea  7 (OL:SUBC) jumped 5 percent after news of joint venture talks with larger rival Schlumberger (N:SLB), which also supported shares in rival  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), up 2 percent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Neste (HE:NESTE) hit a record high following an upgrade from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which said demand for renewable fuels should continue to increase. Telecoms were lifted by a 4 percent rise in BT Group (L:BT), after Britain's telecoms regulator OFCOM set a more generous cap on prices the company can charge rivals to use its fast broadband service. Berenberg analysts upgraded BT to buy from hold saying clarity over the investment case was set to improve and that its share prices already reflected ""fairly negative"" outcomes on regulation, its pension review, and capex risk.The sector, which has been underperforming the broader market in the past few years on worries over competition, regulation and costly investment plans, was also boosted by gains in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)  on heavy newsflow about possible dealmaking.Three sources told Reuters that the Italian former phone monopoly had chosen Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to work on a spin-off of its fixed-line network.Another source said Telecom Italia could ditch a proposed joint-venture with Canal+, the pay-TV arm of its top shareholder French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

194,"Sep 22, 2017 12:24PM ET",Diesel's disgrace brings hybrids-for-all in race to electrify,nan,"By Laurence FrostFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Carmakers squeezed between carbon emissions cuts and falling sales of fuel-efficient diesels have used the Frankfurt auto show to spotlight a future generation of electric cars that will largely come too late to help them out of their bind.But elsewhere at the show, suppliers like  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Delphi are lifting the lid on a quicker fix: affordable 48-volt hybrids.These ""mild"" hybrids, which add some electric power to existing petrol models without a costly redesign, are now being deployed without fanfare by brands from VW to Volvo.It is diesel's disgrace and decline, executives and analysts say, that has finally set the stage for mass electrification. While diesel pollution problems became notorious with the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) test-cheating scandal, the subsequent shift to petrol is bloating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, making the next round of European Union goals harder to meet.""Our view is that 48 volts on a gasoline engine is an alternative to diesel,"" said Karin Thorn, vice president for vehicle propulsion at Volvo. ""If and when the diesel market is dropping, something else needs to take its place.""Diesels are stalling already, in fact - and weaker second-hand values suggest the slump can only accelerate.An attention-grabbing pledge by the Swedish carmaker to ""electrify"" its entire range by 2019, initially hailed as a bold step, now looks more like an industry-wide reality.PSA Group, which had previously seen no need for 48V hybrids, now plans to introduce them ""across the board"" in response to diesel's faster-than-expected decline, the Peugeot maker's programs chief Patrice Lucas told Reuters.By quadrupling the 12-volt standard in conventional car electrics and allowing a beefed up starter motor to feed extra power to the drivetrain, complementing the combustion engine, carmakers can transform petrol cars into mild hybrids without redesigning the vehicle's architecture and factory tooling.ENABLING TECHNOLOGYThe motor delivers a noticeable torque boost and recovers braking energy to recharge a battery - smaller and cheaper than those required by electric cars or ""full"" hybrids such as Toyota's Prius, which typically run at 100-300 volts. Total manufacturing cost comes in 500-1,000 euros ($600-$1,200) below an equivalent diesel.""It's the most interesting enabling technology and will comfortably replace diesel,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. ""It can do the job and it's already cheaper - you don't have to be an early adopter to buy one.""By 2020, the brokerage expects 48V cars to outpace European sales of full hybrids, including plug-ins that can be recharged with a cable and driven in electric-only mode. By 2025, it predicts, they will equip 55 percent of all cars sold.The technology is surfacing first in luxury cars such as the Mercedes S-Class on show at the Frankfurt event - which runs until Sunday - before trickling down to the mass market, chiefly in Europe and China.Volkswagen's next Golf, a benchmark in compact cars, will arrive with 48V electrics in 2019, and other models will follow, development chief Frank Welsch told Reuters. ""The technology has a lot of potential and will make hybrids more affordable for the masses,"" Welsch said.  Renault  (PA:RENA), Japanese affiliate Nissan and Hyundai are among other mass car manufacturers with 48V in the pipeline.In 2021, the key EU emissions goal drops to 95 grammes of CO2 per kilometer from its current 130 grammes - a challenge exacerbated by the replacement of standard lab tests with on-the-road ""real driving emissions"" measurements.DIESEL HEADACHEDespite incentives, neither battery technology nor charging infrastructure is ready for the mass electric-car uptake required to put a dent in average emissions by then.The headache is compounded by the decline of diesels, which emit 15-20 percent less CO2 than petrol alternatives. Fortunately, 48V hybrids deliver savings in the same bracket.Their simplicity also lets carmakers adjust their fleet emissions on shorter lead times than typically required to redevelop a drivetrain, which may help to avoid stiff EU fines of 95 euros per excess gramme of CO2, per vehicle sold.Among suppliers, Valeo stands to benefit most with a 40 percent share of mild-hybrid orders, Citi analysts predict. Continental and Delphi are also well positioned.Paris-based Valeo expects some carmakers to effect more abrupt U-turns than PSA's - in some cases installing 48V systems without waiting for model facelifts. Innovation director Guillaume Devauchelle declined to name names.""These solutions will become market standards,"" Devauchelle said, adding that tougher rules on nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution from diesels would deepen their cost disadvantage.Later 48V hybrids will squeeze out more efficiency by shifting the electric motor lower down the transmission, below the engine. Valeo has electrified Magna's Getrag gearboxes and GKN (LON:GKN) differentials.""What automakers are finding is they need more than just advanced combustion engines to reach the fleet average reductions,"" said Mary Gustanski, Delphi's engineering boss.The supplier is combining 48V hybrids with cylinder deactivation that cuts engine capacity when less power is required, for additional savings. The system is in development with one European and one Chinese carmaker, Gustanstki said.The coming profusion of 48V cars should outsell pricier, higher-voltage hybrid incumbents such as the Prius, as market projections show - a prospect Toyota takes in its stride.Thanks to a quarter-century of hybrid investments, the Japanese carmaker can meet future CO2 targets with ease, global planning chief Didier Leroy said in Frankfurt.""We're in a different position,"" Leroy said. ""We don't have to rush to find a temporary solution - we don't need to develop 48V to be competitive.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

All major European bourses were flat or slightly down, although a number of blue chips swung into the black thanks to positive earnings updates. Vodafone reported better-than-expected revenue growth in its first quarter, and was up 2.3 percent.The world's second largest mobile operator shares boosted the telco index which was the best performing sector with a 0.5 percent rise. Deal-making also triggered some large gains, with payments firm Paysafe surging 8.6 percent after receiving a bid from Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and CVC Capital Partners.But French car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) was down 3.9 percent following its first-half earnings and contributed to a fall in the sector of 0.7 percent, the worst performance by sector in Europe.Philips Lighting, the world's largest maker of lights, also fell 7.6 percent after publishing its second-quarter results. The travel and leisure sector was up 0.2 percent after heavy losses in the previous sessions, due notably to falls in Germany's Lufthansa and the British budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.4 percent, as were the blue chips.Luxury goods group Burberry was the second-top gainer, rising around 4.3 percent after reporting 3 percent underlying revenue growth in the first quarter, helped by stronger demand in mainland China and continuing good performance in its British market.Peers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH also rose around 1 percent.At the other end of the retail spectrum, discount store operator B&M also rose more 4 percent after issuing a trading update, in which it said that it was on track to achieve profit targets for the full year.With the European second quarter results season just around the corner, expectations see earnings increasing by over 9 percent from the same period in 2016, which would be a rise of over 6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. Strength in oil and metals prices helped lift the heavyweight European energy sector and basic resources, which gained 0.8 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.The cyclical autos sector was helped by a 1.3 percent rise in  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) shares, which gained after the car parts maker said that it was eyeing a sale of a unit to Raicam.Education publisher Pearson continued its slide from the previous day when it announced plan to sell its stake in Penguin Random House, down around 4.6 percent as broker downgrades and cuts to estimates rolled in.

212,"Jun 29, 2017 10:40AM ET",Audi to use Valeo's stop-start technology in sports coupe: sources,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume and Andreas CremerPARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker Audi will introduce Valeo's (PA:VLOF) micro-hybrid ""stop-and-start"" systems in its RS5 sports coupe, sources told Reuters, in a sign that the Paris-based supplier may be tapping new premium demand for the fuel-saving technology.The contract with Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) upscale Audi division underlines increased spending by automakers on technology designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in response to tightening standards and testing regimes.Volkswagen and  Valeo  both declined to comment.Unlike a typical alternator, which converts engine torque to electricity to power a vehicle's circuitry and charge its battery, the starter-alternator can also re-start the engine in a fraction of a second.The Valeo system delivers fuel savings of up to 15 percent by automatically shutting down the engine whenever a car is halted by a red light or traffic, with an in-step reduction of CO2 and pollution emissions in congested cities.First introduced in 2004, the so-called ""i-StARS"" technology is a flagship product of Valeo's 4 billion euro ($4.6 billion)propulsion systems division, with 3 million units sold.But launch customer PSA Group (PA:PEUP) and other volume manufacturers have since dropped it from new models in favor of beefed-up starter motors, a cheaper though less efficient stop-and-start solution.The i-StARS system is beginning to find new markets, however, Valeo boss Jacques Aschenbroich told Reuters. ""Demand for it is continuing to grow significantly,"" the CEO said, predicting double-digit percentage sales rise.With the mild-hybrid RS5, which went on sale this month in Germany and in France next week, Audi becomes the first German premium brand to use the technology on its current vehicle lineup.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

231,"Mar 15, 2017 11:10AM ET",Bosch sticks to own technology in face of Intel-Mobileye merger,nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world's biggest maker of automotive components, will continue to develop its own visual technology regardless of Intel's $15 billion deal to buy Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), an executive said on Wednesday.Germany's Bosch competes with Israel's Mobileye, which supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that are essential for autonomous driving, and owns about 70 percent of the market.""We are investing a lot of money in our own video technology and we want to stick with this strategy,"" Bosch managing board member Dirk Hoheisel, who is in charge of mobility services, told a news conference at the Bosch Connected World exhibition.The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's biggest chipmaker, promises to escalate the arms race among carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. The deal was announced on Monday.Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said it was too early to say what effect the merger would have on the competitive landscape or Bosch's own strategy.""I can only comment about the two companies as of today. Intel is a major chip supplier and therefore also partner of Bosch. Mobileye today is clearly a competitor,"" he said.""What the future merger will bring, we will have to see. We will talk of course to Intel and Mobileye.""Bosch, along with rivals including Autoliv and Continental, have decided to stick to plans to develop their own technology for the current generation of ADAS, unlike for example  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), which stopped in-house development and decided to buy Mobileye's products instead.Bosch also relies on an array of partnerships with software makers including SAP, Software AG,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The co-founder of Mobileye as well as the chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, with whom Bosch has a partnership in on-board computers, are also due to speak at the Bosch exhibition in Berlin.Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is expected to give more details on Thursday of the partnership with Bosch, in which they will develop artificial intelligence to guide self-driving cars through complex traffic situations.The computers will be designed to learn how to use knowledge about the vehicle's surroundings gathered with the help of cameras and sensors to make intelligent decisions about how to act, for example to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road.The on-board systems to enable fully automated driving are planned to come onto the market from 2020. ""Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being... so it's a promise,"" Denner told the news conference.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

238,"Jan 15, 2017 09:30AM ET","China, Europe drive shift to electric cars as U.S. lags",nan,"By Laurence FrostDETROIT (Reuters) - Electric cars will pick up critical momentum in 2017, many in the auto industry believe - just not in North America.Tighter emissions rules in China and Europe leave global carmakers and some consumers with little choice but to embrace plug-in vehicles, fuelling an investment surge, said industry executives gathered in Detroit this past week for the city's annual auto show.""Car electrification is an irreversible trend,"" said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), which has expanded sales by 50 percent in five years with a focus on electric, hybrid, connected and self-driving cars.In Europe, green cars benefit increasingly from subsidies, tax breaks and other perks, while combustion engines face mounting penalties including driving and parking restrictions.China, struggling with catastrophic pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles. Its carrot-and-stick approach combines tens of billions in investment and research funding with subsidies, and regulations designed to discourage driving fossil-fueled cars in big cities.The road ahead for electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States, however, could have more hairpin curves. Regulators in California and a group of other U.S. states are pushing ahead with state-level rules mandating rising quotas for electric, or ""zero emission"" vehicles. But plug-in registrations in the United States fell in 2015, and the market share of electric-only vehicles declined further to 0.37 percent in 2016, as cheap fuel drove demand for gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to roll back environmental and climate rules. Groups representing established automakers asked Trump to review Obama administration fuel economy targets out to 2025, even before the outgoing administration formally signed them into effect on Friday. Automakers have also asked Trump to work toward a single, national set of rules to govern automotive greenhouse gas emissions, a move that could spark legal challenges to electric car quotas in California and other states on grounds they present a separate standard.""THE WORLD IS GOING ELECTRIC""Still, industry executives in Detroit said hitting the brakes on electric vehicles in the United States would not relieve the pressure to bring them to market, because China and Europe are forging ahead with policies to expand sales of plug-in cars.That is why Ford (N:F) is moving forward with previously announced plans to invest $4.5 billion for plug-in vehicles by 2020, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this month.""The industry is changing, the infrastructure's starting to build, and that's why our view is (that) within the next 15 years we'll see more electrified offerings … than we'll see gasoline-powered,"" Fields said as he unveiled a $700 million plan to build a battery SUV and other plug-in vehicles in Flat Rock, Michigan.To drive the shift to electric, industry executives said they needed more help from governments. In China, Europe and the United States, automakers are advocating new infrastructure money go to public electric car charging networks.In the United States, EV manufacturers are pushing for the continuation of a $7,500 federal tax subsidy for consumers who buy a fully electric car. Even if Trump were to try to eliminate it, it would take time as Congress would have to act. ""There is not a disagreement that the world is going electric,"" California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said on the sidelines of the auto show, noting that all vehicle makers were now investing in electric models across their entire product lines. The debate, she said, was ""over timing, not the goal."" The Chinese electric car market cast its shadow over the Detroit auto show, where manufacturers showed off plug-in hybrid and electric models that will likely do scant business in the United States.IHS Automotive predicts Chinese plug-in deliveries will hit 1 million in 2019, four years before the United States. China pulled ahead in 2015 with a fourfold sales surge before adding 55 percent last year to 348,000 vehicles, with the United States at 138,000.""Look to China rather than the U.S. for the future of electric cars,"" Gerard Detourbet, a Renault-Nissan executive leading low-cost plug-in development, said recently. ""China is compelled to act – that's the main difference.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

239,"Jan 08, 2017 02:00PM ET","Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars",nan,"By Paul Lienert and Alexandria SageLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens.While some companies, such as  Tesla Motors  (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F), are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are.""What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing,"" said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. ""Everyone is changing partners.""Several suppliers - notably Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe.""If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player,"" said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems.""The technological challenges are immense,"" Shashua told Reuters. ""I would compare it to sending a man to the moon.""Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system.Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and with longtime supplier Delphi.The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000.The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving.""We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021,"" Frickenstein said. ""That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption.""Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber [UBER.UL] to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Frickenstein said.A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia (HE:NOKIA). Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data.Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF [ZFF.UL] and Bosch [ROBG.UL].""We're not looking to develop a proprietary system,"" said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. ""We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping.""While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator.""There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car,"" said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems.Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF).But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said.""There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on,"" Devauchelle said. ""Those are big blocks.""(In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000.)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

246,"Oct 20, 2016 05:35PM ET","Tesla, rivals joust over how to put self-driving cars on the road",nan,"By Paul Lienert and Alexandria SageDETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Tesla Motors  Inc's (O:TSLA) decision to equip all of its vehicles with self-driving hardware has intensified competition among rival camps of technology and auto companies over what equipment will be on board cars of the future.Tesla's self-driving system will rely on cameras and radar sensors -- but not lidar, the laser imaging technology most other companies pursuing self-driving cars are using to generate precise pictures of the environment around their vehicles.Tesla also is not using technology from Mobileye (N:MBLY), the Israeli-based supplier of computer vision chips and software that provided components for earlier Tesla models equipped with Autopilot, a semi-automated system designed to assist with driving but not replace the driver. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Mobileye this summer engaged in a public dispute over the safety of Autopilot following a fatal crash in May in which the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed after hitting a truck while driving on Autopilot.""Selling a vehicle with the latest and greatest hardware, but an unproven self-driving software package is a risky strategy,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson.On Thursday, investors appeared to be betting on Mobileye. Shares of the company rose 2.6 percent to $38.27, while Tesla shares fell 2.2 percent to $199.10.Mobileye supplies two dozen other automakers and suppliers, and has formed alliances to pursue self-driving vehicle systems with German automaker BMW AG, U.S. supplier Delphi and chip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).""As we move to a higher level of autonomy in vehicles, you're going to want to have more redundancy,"" which radar and lidar can provide, Dan Galves, senior vice president at vision safety system maker Mobileye, said in an interview. ""The more sensors, the better.""A winner in the fallout from the Tesla-Mobileye dispute is Nvidia (O:NVDA), the Silicon Valley chipmaker that will provide processors for the new Tesla system. Nvidia shares have more than doubled in the past year, and rose another 1.9 percent on Thursday to close at $67.73.No automaker, including Tesla, currently offers a fully self-driving car, although most major manufacturers and suppliers are working furiously on different technology suites -- including cameras, radar and lidar -- to enable vehicles to drive themselves.Google's self-driving cars use a combination of lidar, radar and cameras. The company has said the multi-sensor approach compensates for the limitations of each type of sensor.Cameras do not perform well in the dark or in bright light. Ice and snow can block a camera's view. Lidar can create a 360 degree view of the car's surroundings, although it is less effective in fog, rain and snow.The high cost of lidar, currently about $8,000, is just one of the obstacles to putting self-driving cars in consumers' hands. But the cost is rapidly declining and is expected to fall to $25-$100 in the coming years. Ford Motor Co  (N:F), an investor in lidar manufacturer Velodyne, said it does not plan to put a fully self-driving vehicle into production for ride-sharing fleets until 2021 and for individual consumers until 2025 or later. Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has said it does not expect to see Level 5 vehicles -- those capable of fully automated operation without humans in all situations -- in widespread use for another 10-15 years.Major automotive technology suppliers, including  Delphi Automotive  PLC (N:DLPH), Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL],  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) and  Valeo  SA (PA:VLOF), are all developing self-driving technology and systems that incorporate lidar.Without lidar, Tesla ""will not be able to handle all situations with this array of sensors,"" said Marta Hall, head of California-based Velodyne, one of the largest suppliers of automotive lidar.UBS analyst Colin Langan raised a concern that while excluding lidar could lower the overall cost of a self-driving system -- now pegged by Tesla at $8,000 without lidar -- ""it would increase negative scrutiny"" if it is proven that a lidar sensor could have prevented a fatal accident.Regulators have signaled they intend to keep tighter reins on automakers and other companies, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google self-driving car project and Uber Technologies, as they roll out self-driving vehicles on public roads.Summarizing the concerns of other automakers and suppliers involved in developing self-driving systems, Langan said Tesla's early deployment of full automation ""without enough testing could have negative long-term consequences"" for widespread adoption of self-driving technology. ""Lidars are becoming very inexpensive, and they will always add an additional safety layer. So in these early days of self-driving, I wonder why anyone wouldn't want to use lidars for added safety,"" said Sebastian Thrun, former head of Google's self-driving car project.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

More than half of that revenue in 20 years, Goldman estimates, will come from radar, cameras and lidar, a sensor that uses laser – all tools considered essential to building vehicles that can pilot themselves.The May 7 death of Ohio technology company owner Joshua Brown in a  Tesla Motors  Inc (O:TSLA) Model S while the car's semi-automated Autopilot system was engaged highlighted the limitations of current automated driving systems.Tesla’s Autopilot system uses cameras and radar, but not lidar. The company said its system would have had trouble distinguishing a white semi-trailer positioned across a road against a bright sky.Industry executives and analysts told Reuters they expect the Tesla crash will spur investment in self-driving vehicle systems that combine multiple of sensors, including lidar.""As we move to a higher level of autonomy in vehicles, you’re going to want to have more redundancy,"" which radar and lidar can provide, Dan Galves, senior vice president at vision safety system maker Mobileye NV (N:MBLY) , said in an interview. ""The more sensors, the better.""Carmakers have been using multiple sensors in prototypes that are in testing but not yet ready for market. A variety of technologies with overlapping capabilities is seen as a way to increase safety under a wider range of circumstances.The valuations of some self-driving startups ""may even increase if there are companies that can solve some of the issues"" the Tesla accident raised, said Quin Garcia, managing director of AutoTech Ventures, a Silicon Valley investment firm.Semi-automated systems such as General Motor Co's (N:GM) SuperCruise and Traffic Jam Pilot from Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi are due on the market in 2017-2018.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) expects to deploy a semi-automated system, using Velodyne lidar, in 2018. Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), which is investing more than $1 billion in such self-driving technologies as robotics and artificial intelligence, said it aims to put fully driverless cars on the road in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Delphi Automotive  PLC (N:DLPH) plans to build lidar vision systems with technology from Quanergy Systems, which makes solid state lidar systems. Delphi plans to combine information from the lidar system with radar and other driver assistance technology to create a 360-degree view around a car, a company official said.Delphi has an investment in Quanergy, one of more than 50 self-driving startups that together have raised more than $800 million in investment capital in the past decade, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available data.At least two of those startups - Quanergy which makes solid state lidar sensors, and Zoox, which is developing fully automated vehicle systems - have jumped in value to more than $1 billion each since GM's $1.2-billion acquisition earlier this year of another self-driving startup, Cruise Automation.Quanergy and Zoox hope to follow the lead of Mobileye, an Israeli supplier of vision-based safety systems to 25 global automakers, including Tesla. Co-founded in 1999 by a computer science professor at Hebrew University, Mobileye went public in 2014 and today is valued at nearly $10 billion.Mobileye plans by 2020 to offer a hardware/software system that can gather, fuse and analyze data from 20 different sensors, including cameras, lidar and radar. The company's new EyeQ5 ""system on chip"" will be a key component in a fully autonomous driving system that is being jointly developed with BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and is aimed at production in 2021.Like Mobileye, Velodyne, a leading supplier of laser-based lidar systems, works with many of the world’s top automakers, including Ford, GM, BMW, Toyota Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and  Daimler  AG’s (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz.""Our clients want to (combine) lidar and cameras,"" Velodyne's Marta Hall, president of business development, told Reuters in an interview. Automakers are stepping up orders as lidar systems come down in size and price, she said.Among the potential beneficiaries of this growing interest is LeddarTech, a relatively young startup based in Canada's Quebec City. The company is providing LED-based lidar systems to French supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), which also buys vision-based systems from Mobileye.Germany's Robert Bosch, which has been developing self-driving components and systems for more than 15 years, buys lidar from an unnamed Tier II supplier and intends to package it in a highly automated “highway pilot” system intended for series production in 2020, said spokesman Tim Wieland.""Bosch sees the necessity for a sensor setup that includes radar, video and lidar,"" Wieland said. The three sensors ""complement each other very efficiently.""REGULATION AND LITIGATION WILD CARDSRegulation and litigation are two big wild cards for the autonomous driving sector.Safety regulators and industry executives have said self-driving cars ultimately could slash traffic fatalities – about 35,000 last year in the United States and more than 1.2 million globally - by up to 90 percent. But regulators are also concerned that drivers could be lulled into unsafe behavior by systems that take control for a time, but expect human operators to re-take command in an emergency.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the role of Autopilot in the Florida accident and another crash in Pennsylvania involving a Tesla vehicle. The agency also is expected to roll out this summer broad guidelines for deploying autonomous vehicle technology.""I hope NHTSA does not overreact"" to the crash, said Stefan Heck, co-founder of Nauto, another Silicon Valley self-driving startup with corporate backing. ""The tradeoff is quite clear: Some safety improvement is better than none.""Product liability for automated vehicles is uncharted territory. The U.S. Transportation Department has said an automated driving system could be considered the ""driver"" for regulatory purposes.Industry executives are betting that consumer interest in the technology will rise.A survey conducted by AlixPartners in June - before the Tesla accident was reported publicly - found that 90 percent of respondents would be interested in a self-driving car that would let the driver take the wheel from time to time. The same survey noted that nearly 80 percent of respondents would pay for the technology - including 10 percent who would spend up to $5,000.The favorable response rates are much higher than in previous surveys on self-driving technology.News of the Tesla crash ""is not going to put too much of a dent in public perception"" of self-driving cars, said AlixPartners' Mark Wakefield.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

273,"Mar 31, 2016 03:06PM ET",Where's the lane? Self-driving cars confused by shabby U.S. roadways,nan,"By Alexandria SageLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Volvo's North American CEO, Lex Kerssemakers, lost his cool as the automaker's semi-autonomous prototype sporadically refused to drive itself during a press event at the Los Angeles Auto Show.""It can't find the lane markings!"" Kerssemakers griped to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who was at the wheel. ""You need to paint the bloody roads here!""Shoddy infrastructure has become a roadblock to the development of self-driving cars, vexing engineers and adding time and cost. Poor markings and uneven signage on the 3 million miles of paved roads in the United States are forcing automakers to develop more sophisticated sensors and maps to compensate, industry executives say.Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the mundane issue of faded lane markings ""crazy,"" complaining they confused his semi-autonomous cars.An estimated 65 percent of U.S. roads are in poor condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, with the transportation infrastructure system rated 12th in the World Economic Forum's 2014-2015 global competitiveness report.Tesla, Volvo, Mercedes, Audi (DE:VOWG_p) and others are fielding vehicles that can drive on highways, change lanes and park without human help. But they are easily flummoxed by faded lane markers, damaged or noncompliant signs or lights, and the many quirks of a roadway infrastructure managed by thousands of state and local bureaucracies.In other developed countries, greater standardization of road signs and markings makes it easier for robot cars to navigate. In the U.S., however, traffic lights can be aligned vertically, horizontally or ""dog-house"" style in two columns. Pavement markings use paint with different degrees of reflectivity - or don't exist at all.""If the lane fades, all hell breaks loose,"" said Christoph Mertz, a research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. ""But cars have to handle these weird circumstances and have three different ways of doing things in case one fails.""MORE SENSORS, MORE COSTTo make up for roadway aberrations, carmakers and their suppliers are incorporating multiple sensors, maps and data into their cars, all of which adds cost.Mercedes says the ""drive pilot"" system found in its recently unveiled luxury E Class 2017 sedans works even with no lane markings. The system - which incorporates 23 sensors - takes into account guard rails, barriers, and other cars to keep cars in their lanes up to 84 miles (135km) per hour, under ""suitable circumstances.""Boston Consulting Group estimates that initial semi-autonomous features add $4,000 to a car's price. It estimated carmakers will have to spend more than $1 billion over the next decade in research investment for even more sophisticated autonomous features.On a good road in daylight, cameras installed around a car are sufficient to distinguish road lines, traffic lights and signs. But without lane markings, the car needs more technology to judge its position.Enter radar and lidar, which send out radio waves or light pulses to bounce off objects. The data sent back informs the car about objects, their distance and velocity. Triangulating between trees to the right, boulders to the left, and other vehicles ahead, for instance, can give the car its bearings.A host of companies - including Silicon Valley firms Quanergy and Velodyne and international suppliers like Paris-based  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) - are vying to reduce the cost and size of lidar from the bulky, $75,000 Velodyne version first seen on the roof of Google's self-driving car.In January, Quanergy unveiled a small $250 Lidar with no moving parts. Automakers want the price to drop below $100 for production vehicles, which Quanergy promises to do by 2018.Sub-par roads are fueling efforts by companies such as Germany's HERE and Dutch company TomTom to create three dimensional maps that can provide the car's location on the road within centimeters, said Chris Warrington, CEO of mapping technology company GeoDigital.Automakers are looking to pay $50-$60 per car for such maps, which may be well below the actual price, said Warrington.""We know they're coming, but they don't exist yet. That's why lane markings are so important now,"" said Gary O'Brien, director of advanced engineering for automotive supplier Delphi Automotive Systems PLC.O'Brien snaps photos of bad roads when he travels. ""Look at this, there are no lane markings at all!"" O'Brien said, showing a picture he took on a desert road in Bluff, Utah where the demarcation between the road and ground is barely visible. ""MAKE UP YOUR MIND!""Some officials envision traffic signals that communicate with cars at dangerous intersections and vehicles that can signal each other their positions, direction and speed.The U.S. Department of Transportation's ""Smart City Challenge,"" a competitive grant program, will offer up to $40 million this summer to help one city integrate new technologies, which could include infrastructure for self-driving cars.The Transportation Research Board, an independent group that advises the government, plans to issue recommendations for standardized lane markings for machine vision by 2017. By then, several automakers say they plan to offer models with some form of autonomous highway driving.Paul Carlson, a research engineer focused on infrastructure at Texas A&M University, said he gets calls from transportation officials asking how to accommodate robot cars.He tells them to aim for consistency: ""Make up your mind, people! Do you want your traffic lights vertical or horizontal?""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

276,"Jan 08, 2016 05:12AM ET",Fragrance anyone? Touch-free car controls split world's drivers ,nan,"By Alexandria SageLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Germans love the latest wave of touch-free car controls, which respond to the flick of a wrist or the swipe of a hand, as it means no messy fingerprints on their spotless dashboards. Italians, known for an extravagant hand gesture or two, are not so sure. A simplistic stereotype, but it captures the split among the world's drivers over the newest in-car tech on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) demonstrated a 7 Series car that recognizes five simple gestures, from a finger twirl to the right to raise the music volume and a hand swipe to decline an incoming call. Japan's Pioneer (T:6773) had a minty scent shoot out of a dashboard to revive a driver after a car seat sensor detected a falling heart rate, a possible prelude to nodding off.""It's certainly weird, certainly odd and certainly unproven. But Pioneer is not off base to connect one sensory organ to others,"" said Mark Boyadjis, an analyst at consulting firm IHS Automotive.Given that drivers have enough to do keeping their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road, touch-free controls for some non-essential functions makes sense. But it is not clear all drivers want gesture, eye-tracking or even lip-reading technology.""The jury is out"" on how widespread it will become, said Jeffrey Owens, chief technology officer for  Delphi Automotive  (N:DLPH), which made BMW's gesture software.NATIONAL DIFFERENCES The Japanese, some of the keenest consumers of novelty technology, are likely fans of Pioneer's 'bio-sensing system' that squirts out fragrance, said the company's marketing head Russ Johnston.Enthusiastic visitors to Pioneer's booth at CES suggested cappuccino and peppermint as good wake-up smells, he said. The Japanese were the first to embrace back-up, or reversing, assistance because they did not want to bang their cars, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation at French auto parts supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), who identified cultural preferences as a huge factor in adoption.""There's no universal solution,"" said Devauchelle, whose company hired an ethnologist to make sense of different cultures with different tastes. He pointed out Germans' dislike of touchscreens, the risks of gesture control with expressive Italians, and the eager uptake of any kind of new tech by the Chinese.Regardless of national tastes, the market for gesture recognition technology in vehicles - and the cheaper, more prevalent proximity sensing, in which the approach of a hand will trigger a touchable menu screen - is growing rapidly.IHS Automotive predicts a seven-fold jump in unit sales of such technology to 30.4 million in 2021 from 3.7 million today. But full consumer buy-in is an open question, and cost may keep such features a limited, luxury option.SAFETY QUESTIONS Safety experts have cautiously welcomed dashboard simplification, but note gesture control and other such features may actually add to confusion.""If a driver doesn't know how to use it, will that increase the distraction?"" asked Henry Jasny, vice president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety in Washington. ""There's no proof that it will improve safety.""Automakers are free by law to test an array of options in their cars. The industry has voluntary guidelines that say drivers should complete tasks in a series of single glances taking no more than 2 seconds each, for a total of 20 seconds. Systems are never foolproof, noted IHS' Boyadjis, who said he once triggered a blaring radio with an innocuous gesture. Car makers and industry watchers are divided on whether touch-free controls will catch on, or even be overtaken by self-driving cars.The human-machine interface ""will be the differentiator for car makers"" after safety systems, said Rainer Holve, head of connected car automotive software for Elektrobit, a subsidiary of German auto supplier  Continental AG  (DE:CONG).But Boyadjis at IHS is wary of ""differentiation for the sake of differentiation.""""BMW has the capacity to throw this arguably unnecessary but innovative product into the 7 Series, not too concerned with the cost... and wait to see if the seed grows,"" he said. ""The rest of the industry is watching.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

280,"Sep 30, 2015 11:58AM ET",U.S. car buyers unwilling to pay for automatic safety systems: study,nan,"By Paul LienertDETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. car buyers are not willing to pay for a new generation of automatic safety devices without an extra push from legislators, regulators, manufacturers, dealers and insurers, according to a new study. The survey, released on Tuesday, covered a range of new safety features, from automatic parking, typically a $395 option, to infrared night vision ($2,260).""These technologies are not inexpensive,"" said Steve Handschuh, chief executive officer of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association.The Boston Consulting Group, which conducted the survey for the association, estimated the cost of seven automated safety systems at $8,240 but said consumers were willing to pay only 25 percent to 70 percent of that.U.S. car buyers are more willing to spend money on convenience ahead of safety, said Xavier Mosquet, who heads Boston Consulting's North American automotive practice. Advanced safety systems such as adaptive cruise control, that are partially automated but relieve some of the tedium of driving, are therefore more attractive, he said.Because many advanced driver assistance features are still so expensive, their adoption in the United States continues to grow slowly, at an annual rate of 2 percent to 5 percent, Boston Consulting said.""Motivation is obviously needed"" to boost those rates, which in turn could dramatically reduce costs, Handschuh said.Without such motivation, from lower insurance rates to new government regulations, it will take 20 to 25 years for widespread adoption, he said.Boston Consulting said automated driver assistance systems could help U.S. drivers avert 28 percent of vehicle crashes and save 9,900 lives each year.Suppliers of advanced driver assistance systems include Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], Autoliv Inc,  Continental AG  (XETRA:CONG), Delphi Automotive PLC,  Valeo  (PARIS:VLOF) SA and Denso Corp.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

291,"Aug 16, 2015 06:27AM ET",Exclusive: Germany's Mann + Hummel buys U.S. peer for $1.3-1.4 billion - source,nan,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German car parts maker Mann + Hummel is buying U.S. firm Affinia's auto filter unit for $1.3-1.4 billion, a person familiar with the transaction said on Sunday. The deal is the third within a year in which a U.S. auto supplier is bought by a German peer, following ZF's takeover of TRW [TRWTA.UL] and Mahle's acquisition of Delphi's [DCLC.UL] air-conditioning unit.Consolidation has heated up in the sector, as valuations are high and suppliers are vying for size in a battle over pricing power in talks with car makers. Canada's Magna (TO:MG) scooped up Germany's Getrag in mid-July, while  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is said to be exploring a sale of its auto parts unit Magneti Marelli.Affinia's private equity owner Cypress put the company's filtration business, which last year posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $156 million, up for sale this year, asking investment bank Baird to find a buyer.The asset also attracted interest from peers including U.S.-based Donaldson (N:DCI), France's  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Germany's Freudenberg. Mann + Hummel and Affinia were not immediately available for comment outside business hours.Affinia is the former replacement parts business of car parts maker Dana, which sold the unit to Cypress and co-investor OMERS in 2004 for $1.1 billion.The filtration business, which specialises in after-market oil, fuel, air and coolant filters, posted 2014 sales of $967 million. Affinia's South America unit, with annual revenues of $430 million, was sold separately in June. Last year, Affinia's chassis components business was sold to Federal-Mogul (O:FDML).The whole group had net debt of $766 million at the end of 2014.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

301,"Jul 17, 2015 02:12PM ET",Exclusive: Fiat Chrysler exploring $3.3 billion sale of auto parts unit Magneti Marelli ,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Agnieszka Flak LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is considering whether to sell its auto parts maker Magneti Marelli after receiving interest from potential buyers, according to sources familiar with the matter.At least two U.S. private equity funds are looking to team up with industry players and submit joint bids for Magneti Marelli, which supplies all major carmakers in Europe, the Americas and Asia, three sources told Reuters.    A recent offer, by a consortium including a U.S. buyout fund, valuing the business at less than 2.5 billion euros was rebuffed in June as FCA would not agree to sell for less than 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion), one of the sources said.FCA declined to comment, while a Magneti Marelli spokesman had no comment.    Debt-laden FCA could sell the wholly owned unit either in parts or in its entirety, the sources said, adding that no final decision on a disposal had been taken. Magneti Marelli has often been touted as a takeover target. While FCA has always denied any interest in selling, the sources said the Italian-American carmaker had recently told interested parties it may reconsider its plans.    The world's seventh-largest carmaker currently has its hands full with a planned initial public offering of luxury sports car maker Ferrari, skedded for after mid-October, and any decision on Magneti Marelli would be taken after that, the sources said.Yet U.S. buyout funds have been working on the dossier for months, the sources said.""Letters are piling up on Fiat's table,"" one of the sources said, pointing to a handful of unsolicited approaches. ""We expect Chief Executive (Sergio) Marchionne to react to these approaches sooner rather than later.""A sale of the unit, which employs more than 38,000 and is present in 19 countries, could help FCA pay off some debt and fund an ambitious 48 billion euro ($52 billion) investment plan. The plan could gain traction as Marchionne's plea to merge with rival carmaker General Motors (N:GM) is so far falling on deaf ears.Based on the outskirts of Milan, Magneti Marelli had revenues of 6.5 billion euros last year and an operating profit, including unusual items, of 204 million euros. It makes components for lighting, engines, electronics, suspension and exhausts, among others. BREAK-UP OPTIONSThe bidders aim to gain full control of Magneti Marelli and later split it up based on their own expertise, the sources said.""Everyone will take a fair share of it,"" one of the sources said.A number of large buyout funds, mainly U.S. based, are particularly interested in Magneti Marelli's lighting unit, which could be carved out and turned into a standalone firm, the source said.This unit is worth around 2 billion euros and could appeal to global players such as  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), Hella (DE:HLE), Koido and Stanley (T:6923), a sector banker said.Asian players could also make a move for the company, another source said, pointing to China's Wanxiang Group (SZ:000559) as a possible bidder.Auto parts makers have shown growing appetite for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals in a bid to boost their global presence.Earlier this year Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen completed its $13.5 billion acquisition of U.S. rival TRW Automotive Holdings.Italian tire maker Pirelli sold to ChemChina in March as part of a multi-layered 7.3 billion-euro ($8 billion) deal.Marchionne is in no rush to sell Magneti Marelli and will be picky when choosing a buyer to ensure stable future supply of components to FCA plants, which churn out anything from tiny Fiat 500s, Jeep sport utility vehicles to luxury Maseratis.Another source said that FCA may also review strategic options for two smaller auto components units, Comau and Teksid, with revenues of 1.55 billion euros and 639 million euros, respectively. In 2012 Marchionne said Fiat could put Magneti Marelli on the block as an option to raise additional cash to lift its stake in Chrysler. Fiat completed its buyout of the U.S. unit last year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

323,"Mar 27, 2015 10:57AM ET",Valeo's self-driving car systems learn from Safran drones,nan,"By Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - French auto parts maker  Valeo  (PARIS:VLOF) plans to draw on drone software and other military technologies from partner  Safran  (PARIS:SAF) to offer self-driving vehicle platforms to carmakers by the end of the decade.While demonstrating an autonomous car and other prototype systems jointly developed with Safran, the French defense and aerospace group, Valeo said on Friday the first applications may reach carmaker clients within three years.Under a 2013 research and development agreement, the Paris-based companies are collaborating on self-driving systems with final applications ranging from hatchbacks to unmanned aircraft.""We realized very quickly that we had much more in common than we'd expected,"" Valeo innovation chief Guillaume Devauchelle told Reuters. ""It turns out that an autonomous vehicle is really a terrestrial drone.""Cars that complete whole journeys without human input are still many years away, but creeping automation is well underway, with models already on sale that can pilot themselves through slow traffic and hit the brakes when a pedestrian steps out.Analysts see a booming market for the vehicles and the connected services their hands-off drivers will be increasingly free to consume. And with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) both entering the fray, the traditional auto industry is braced for disruption.The Valeo-Safran collaboration works because each company serves distinct markets, Valeo boss Jacques Aschenbroich said. Valeo has the right to sell joint technology to automakers, leaving defense, aerospace and rail applications to Safran.Safran is now offering to equip armored vehicles with 360-degree camera software developed by Valeo as a parking aid, the companies said.Valeo-equipped self-driving cars will draw on infrared imaging, algorithms and ""dynamic mapping"" used in Patroller drones and other Safran hardware.The joint R&D push has yielded ""an absolute outpouring of ideas,"" the Valeo CEO said. ""Within a fairly short space of time you'll be seeing a lot of Safran technology in cars (equipped by) Valeo, and plenty of Valeo in Safran aerospace and security products.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

331,"Jan 19, 2015 01:10PM ET",Global patents reflect advances in connected and self-driving cars,nan,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Paul LienertSEOUL/DETROIT (Reuters) - Technology advances in telematics and driver assistance systems are gathering steam as the enablers of future connected and self-driving cars, according to an analysis of global patent applications released Monday.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor posted the biggest gains in the number of patent filings over the past five years, narrowing the gap with industry leader Toyota, according to the report by Thomson Reuters IP & Science.The survey, ""The State of Innovation in the Automotive Industry 2015,"" analyzed patent applications and mapped trends in five key areas: Propulsion, navigation, handling, safety and security, and entertainment.Hyundai was among the leaders in every category, ranking number three overall behind Toyota Motor Corp and Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL]. Hyundai, which along with sister company Kia Motor is fifth in global sales, has outperformed the overall auto market thanks to its stylish, yet affordable models, but experts say the duo lacks a technological edge to better compete with rivals.    Hyundai, which has been a fast-follower in the industry, had seen a surge of patent litigation since gaining global prominence in recent years. Hyundai's patent filings more than doubled to 1,200 in 2013, from 500 in 2010, according to the report by Thomson Reuters' Intellectual Property & Science business.    Although Toyota is still the overall leader in terms of auto innovations - those protected with patents - Hyundai is the fastest-growing, most up-and-coming innovator in the space, the report said. Hyundai ranked third in the number of patent lawsuits filed by the firms which specialize in suing others for infringement, just behind Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co, according to SU Intellectual Property, a Seoul-based IP firm. ""Hyundai has belatedly realized the importance of patents and has been keeping pace with rivals,"" said Jung Dong-joon, representative attorney of SU Intellectual Property. ""While Hyundai has increased the number of its patent filings, it is still a follower in terms of patent quality,"" he said, adding that Hyundai needs to secure more core patents.Overall, Asians and Germans dominated the top 10 companies for patent applications, while GM, ranked seventh, was the only U.S. company making the list.    The automotive sector saw the number of patent filings around the world grow by double-digits year-on-year over the past five years, the Thomson Reuters report said.While Google Inc has dominated headlines in self-driving cars, Toyota, GM and Hyundai received the most patents in this area, said Bob Stembridge, one of the report's authors.Telematics refers to the linking of wireless communication devices with computers in cars, for navigation, to track vehicles on the road, or to control a car's functions from your smart phone. ""We see a lot of increasing activity in telematics and driver assistance systems as the supporting technologies for self-driving cars,"" said Stembridge, an analyst with Thomson Reuters IP & Science.Among the leaders in driver-assistance patents are Bosch, Daimler AG, Continental AG, Valeo SA and Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi. GM and Hyundai lead the advances in telematics.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

335,"Jul 02, 2014 03:00AM ET",Intelligent cars draw investors to tech stocks,nan,"By Blaise Robinson PARIS (Reuters) - Technology and telecoms firms could be the big winners in a connected car market that may be worth $50 billion over the next decade, luring investors away from traditional automakers. Chip-makers or tech giants such as Infineon and Google are among a variety of companies involved in the rapid development and testing of intelligent cars from those that drive themselves to those allowing a driver to use mobile phone apps through the dashboard. A number of carmakers are embracing the trend, with Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG's Audi and Toyota Motor Corp working with outside tech firms to test self-driving car technology. However, it is the tech and telecom firms - from U.S. bellwethers to small European companies - that are seen benefiting the most, fund managers and analysts said. ""It's a whole new market emerging,"" said Christian Jimenez, fund manager and president of Diamant Bleu Gestion. ""The best way to play it for investors in the long term is to buy names such as Microsoft or chip makers such as Infineon, not (automakers) Peugeot and Renault"". If the new market grows to $50 billion as forecast by French bank Exane BNP Paribas that would be roughly half the size of German carmaker BMW's revenues last year.  Internet giant Google Inc is leading the charge among tech companies, trying to break into the century-old industry as it works on its own prototypes of fully autonomous vehicles. It may be a few years before driverless cars hit the road but Google is already shaking things up in the sector, saying last week that the first cars running its Android Auto - a voice-enabled software allowing drivers to navigate maps and send messages while behind the wheel - will hit showrooms later this year. Apple is also in the race, with its new CarPlay - which integrates iPhone functionality - allowing drivers to use applications directly via the dashboard to view maps, make calls, listen to music and send and receive text messages. Only about 10 percent of vehicles have built-in connectivity today, but the number is expected to rise to more than 90 percent by 2020, according to the British consulting firm Machina Research. ""This is not a distant dream, but a five-year race where there is money to be made, or lost,"" Exane BNP analyst Stuart Pearson said in a note to clients, predicting that the market for connected car services would grow by an estimated 30 percent a year through to 2020.   EUROPEAN PRESENCE Investors are also keen to pick smaller, specialized companies at the heart of changes in the car driving. AKKA technologies, a French engineering firm which has been developing a prototype of electrical driverless car, has seen its stock soared by nearly six-fold since 2009. ""The autonomous car is not science fiction, it's real and it's happening now. The technology is ready, it's just a question of regulation at this point,"" said Philippe Obry, head of research and development at AKKA. ""The idea is not to upgrade existing cars with new technologies, it's to rethink the whole sector and the way people will use cars in the future...We're not a car maker, so it's been easier for us to think outside the box."" Shares in French electric car battery maker Blue Solutions have jumped 130 percent since their initial public offering last October, which was more than 15 times oversubscribed.  Among big European tech stocks, Nokia and TomTom are seen facing their make-or-break moment with the connected car, Exane's Pearson said. ""The two map-makers hold a duopoly in maps for embedded solutions of original equipment manufacturers and auto part suppliers. If these embedded solutions dominate in the long run, our TomTom fair value could rise by 32 percent, 13 percent at Nokia.""  CHIP MAKERS PROFIT Analysts and fund managers also see chip makers such as Germany's Infineon and Texas Instruments profiting from the push into driverless cars, while telecom operators will also win from the increased data revenue, with larger, cross-border operators set to dominate. Last April, Infineon - whose chips activate airbags, enable cruise control and cut vehicle emissions - raised its profit outlook for the year and said it would lift its dividend after posting forecast-beating quarterly results, buoyed by robust demand from the automotive sector. Qualcomm and Intel are already competing to supply chips that connect cars to the Internet and processors for increasingly sophisticated navigation and entertainment systems. Whether made with 3G chips from Qualcomm or Bluetooth and Wifi chips from Broadcom, every wirelessly connected car needs components to handle power amplification, switching and filtering, made by companies such RF Micro Devices Inc and Skyworks Solutions. This year, those two companies have seen their stocks surge 91 percent and 68 percent respectively. ""Whether it's connectivity from a phone or a car or a Nest thermostat or a home security system, the only thing ubiquitous across the Internet of Things is they have to connect wirelessly,"" said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree, who recommends Skyworks as a play on connected cars. Bosch, STMicro and San Jose, California-based InvenSense are supplying growing numbers of sophisticated sensor chips for braking, driver assist and other safety functions that are bringing cars nearer to becoming autonomous.

 By Jacqueline Wong	 SHANGHAI, April 21 (Reuters) - A tentative move by China's
government to force foreign suppliers of electric-vehicle
components to share technology and team up with Chinese
companies has raised eyebrows, but few foreign companies have
scaled back their big plans for the world's largest auto market.	 Since April 1, China's top economic planner has floated the
idea on its website (www.ndrc.gov.cn) that foreign players who
supply green vehicles and parts must partner with local partners
and cap their holdings at 50 percent, a major setback for
companies such as Delphi Automotive.	 But nearly all industry players, from Johnson Controls
 to Valeo SA and others, are gearing up to
secure a foothold in a country where 10 percent of the vehicles
on the road could be electric by 2020, double the share of the
world average, according to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.	 ""All these years, foreign parts suppliers have been able to
operate on their own if they want to,"" said Yale Zhang, managing
director of industry consultancy Automotive Foresight (Shanghai)
Co. ""But all of a sudden they are told to find a partner or
else. Of course they will be upset. Why should they want to
share technologies with anyone, especially those related with
green vehicles?""	 At the Shanghai auto show this week, a Johnson Controls
subsidiary announced plans to supply battery systems for two
electric vehicles, the C30 and M30, made by state auto group
Beijing Automotive Industry Company (BAIC).	 Johnson is also planning to set up a technical center in
China and may follow that with a design and development center,
testing labs and manufacturing facilities, according to Robin
Choi, director of commercial business development for the
Asia-Pacific division of Johnson.	 ""We are kind of surprised that they limited it at 50
percent,"" Choi told Reuters. ""It's a little bit of a concern for
us. To be honest, we don't know what the result will be, but we
are continuing the dialogue with the government. It's not
official yet. If it is, we might have to follow the rules.""	    The German auto parts maker Schaeffler is in the same boat.
The company has been among a select few overseas suppliers that
have been running their China business independently over the
past decade.	 The company made 50 percent of its $1.5 billion sales in
China last year from its automotive business and its Asia chief
sees new opportunities in China's E-mobility drive, which is
said to be receiving more than 100 billion yuan ($14.8 billion)
in government subsidies over the next 10 years. [ID:nTOE67303F]	 ""We just have to be alert to watch very carefully about what
will happen. No matter what the final outcome will be, we can
contribute one way or the other,"" said Wolfgang Dangel,
president of Schaeffler's Asia-Pacific division.	 ""At the end of the day, we are still confident as we have
enough technology and expertise on our hands.""	 Schaeffler has just set up an E-mobility team in China,
heavily focused on the automotive business.	 Hans-Peter Kunze, Valeo's senior executive vice president of
sales and business development, also offered a positive spin on
the proposed change before it is put into law.	 ""It's still a draft and how many drafts have we seen in our
lives?"" he said with a laugh.	 Valeo is part of a consortium of suppliers capable of
supplying a range of green technologies from electric motors to
battery management systems.	 It has started to supply the Chinese market with start-stop
technologies for energy-saving cars this year and already has
several Chinese automakers on its client lists, which Kunze
declined to name.	 Many suppliers are actively lobbying Chinese policy makers
through various channels in the hopes they could end up getting
a level playing field in what is arguably becoming the world's
most important auto market.	 An upcoming visit to Germany by China's technology and
information minister, Wan Gang, provides an opportunity for
""communication,"" as Schaeffler executives like to put it.	 Wan, whose career included a stint in Audi AG , 	
is the mastermind behind the country's green mobility blueprint.	  OUTSPOKEN CRITICS	 While most foreign parts suppliers are relatively muted in
their criticism, some executives have not hesitated to speak
their minds.	 ""I think what they are trying to do is to mandate
innovation,"" said Craig Giffi, global automotive sector leader
of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. ""It can create as much negative
impact as positive impact.""	 ""Naturally this is the most attractive market all over the
world, but you can create a bunch of policies to make it
unattractive,"" he added.	 China, industry observers say, has a practical reason to
open the door to outside investors to jump-start the market and
achieve its ambitious target to have 1 million green vehicles on
the road by 2020. Currently sales are estimated to be no more
than a few thousand at best.	 ""Frankly, the local industry cannot mass-market EVs on the
back of what they have in technology in China right now,"" said
William Russo, an industry veteran who is running his own
consultancy, Synergistics, in Beijing. ""Foreign companies have
to bring more current EV technologies to the market.""	 ""It is the largest auto market,"" he added. ""It will be the
largest EV market, provided both the industry players and
infrastructure players want to invest. I don't think China needs
the investment capital, but they do need the know-how.""	 Tesla Motors , which supplies powertrains to Toyota
Motor's electric RVA and is setting its sights on
China, is obviously frustrated.	 ""It's a classic  political economic model,"" said Diarmuid
O'Connell, vice president of business development for Tesla. ""I
understand why the Chinese government wants to pursue it. When
you have leverage, you want to use it to develop your domestic
industry.""	 ""But we are not constrained like that in any partnerships,""
he said. ""It certainly gives any company the cause to think very
seriously whether it's worth the effort.""	 Tesla, however, still wants to be part of the game ""if the
Chinese government is practically endorsing the technology and
saying if EV is going to take off, it should take off here,"" he
said.	 Wang Dazong, president of BAIC, seemed to have his own
interpretation of Beijing's tentative rule.	 ""That's not how I understand the policy because it's
discriminatory to foreigners. I don't think that's the policy,""
he said.

338,"Oct 23, 2009 03:03AM ET",French Oct flash PMIs point to stronger recovery,nan," By Anna Willard PARIS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Activity in the French private
sector expanded at its fastest pace in 35 months in October, a
key survey showed on Friday, in a sign that the fourth quarter
got off to a good start. The Markit/CDAF flash composite purchasing managers' index
(PMI), which combines data from both the manufacturing and
services sectors, rose to 58.4 from 54.8 in September. It was the third consecutive month that the index has
remained above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. ""France really is seeing a surge in growth which seems to be
broad based across manufacturing, services, businesses and the
consumer,"" said Markit economist Chris Williamson. The flash factory PMI rose to 55.3, also the highest in 35
months, after a final reading of 53.0 in September. The
consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had called
for a more modest rise to 53.4. The flash services PMI climbed to 57.8, a 20 month high,
after 53.2 in September. Growth of new business supported a steep rise in output with
new orders in the private sector coming in at their fastest pace
since November 2007. The report backs other recent data pointing to more optimism
in the euro zone's second largest economy and showing that the
fourth quarter may have had a healthy start. Business confidence rose to its highest level in a year in
October, official data showed on Thursday. ""We're at a level now that is consistent with GDP (gross
domestic product growth) of about a 0.6 percent quarterly rate,""
Williamson said of the PMI survey. The French economy grew a surprise 0.3 percent in the second
quarter and Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday
the third quarter would be better than previous ones. The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists found
that the economy would grow 0.4 percent in the third quarter and
0.3 percent in the fourth. Williamson said the PMI survey indicated that the forecast
for the final three months of the year was too pessimistic. Some companies are also starting to do better. French car parts maker Valeo raised its production forecast
for the second half this week after posting third-quarter net
income of 4 million euros, after three consecutive quarterly
losses.  The head of advertising group Publicis, Maurice Levy, told
Reuters on Wednesday the advertising market would continue to
improve slowly and progressively after hitting a trough at the
end of June.

 (Adds share price, analyst comment) By Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot
Citroen said third-quarter revenues slowed less sharply than in
previous quarters as it boosted market share in Europe, where
governments launched car buying incentives. Peugeot Citroen shares fell over 7 percent in early trading
as the revenues fell short of analyst expectations buoyed by
forecast-beating earnings from German rival Daimler on Monday. European car makers have cut production and reduced costs
after auto sales dropped by their biggest fall for 15 years in
2008 and government incentive schemes have helped attracting
clients to showrooms again, and order new cars. This has especialy boosted smaller models, such as a large
part of the Peugeot and Citroen line-up, but not the bigger cars
such as the C6 or Peugeot 607. ""What we have today is a revenue disappointment and no
obvious sign of the large production re-ramp that many have
anticipated,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. ""We would expect a dose of profit-taking today.""
Third-quarter revenue at the group fell 7.7 percent,
compared with a 24.9 percent year-on-year fall in the first
quarter and an 18.9 percent drop in the second, Peugeot said in
a statement on Wednesday. The carmaker said it felt the benefit of scrapping schemes,
whereby drivers get a discount on new models when they scrap
their old vehicle. This applied in France, Italy and the UK, but
especially in Germany, Europe's biggest car market. European markets were mixed in the third quarter, however,
with a negative impact from central and eastern European
markets, the company said. The overall European car market decreased just 0.3 percent
in the third quarter, compared with a 14.4 percent decline in
the first six months of the year, Peugeot said. Chief Executive Philippe Varin said last month he expected
the European market to be down around 10 percent this year. Peugeot increased overall market share in Europe to 13.4
percent compared with 12.9 percent a year earlier. The market for light commercial vehicles remained ""very
weak"" in the quarter, Peugeot said, adding that it increased
market share to 22.1 percent from 19.2 percent in this segment. Inventories of unsold vehicles -- a major cash concern for
carmakers when the crisis hit last year -- decreased by 36
percent to 400,000 vehicles compared with 628,000 at the start
of the year, the company said.
 SHARES DROP Shares in Peugeot were 5.65 percent lower at 22.85 euros by
0904 GMT, making them the biggest fallers on a 1.77 percent
weaker DJ Stoxx European autos index. They also led declines on
the French blue-chip CAC 40 index. ""The factors behind our view that 2010 can see positive
surprises remain intact; we see nothing incremental
today to improve the case,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts added. Daimler on Monday posted a fall in third-quarter earnings
before interest and tax to 470 million euros that beat the
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus estimate of 141 million. It
said it expected free cash flow to be positive for the year. On Tuesday, French car parts makers Faurecia, 70 percent
owned by Peugeot, and Valeo made upbeat statements about the
rest of the year. Valeo said it was increasing its second-half production
forecast after a third-quarter profit, and Faurecia raised its
outlook for second-half sales. PSA's domestic rival, Renault, is due to report
third-quarter sales on Oct. 29. Italian auto maker Fiat SpA is
due to post results later on Wednesday.

mths * Banks lead gains; sector up 118 percent since early March * Defensives stocks catching up in cyclical-led rally * For up-to-the-minute market news, click on  By Blaise Robinson PARIS, June 11 (Reuters) - European equities ended at their
highest close in five months on Thursday, propelled by buoyant
banking stocks, as U.S. macro data showing the recession was
abating helped shares extend their sharp three-month rally. Data showed sales at U.S. retailers rose in May for the
first time in three months, and the number of workers filing new
applications for jobless benefits fell for a fourth straight
week last week. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended 0.9
percent higher at 887.78 points, the index's highest close since
Jan 6. Thursday's rally was led by banking shares, such as HSBC,
UBS, Barclays and BNP Paribas, up 2.2-5.6 percent. But sectors seen as defensive such as utilities, pharma and
telecoms -- shunned by investors during most of the spring rally
--  were also on the rise, with Vodafone up 2.5 percent, Roche
up 1.9 percent and E.ON up 1.3 percent. ""Cyclical stocks are now priced at valuation levels that we
usually see at mid-cycle. That's premature because the economic
activity is still in bad shape,"" said Chicuong Dang, equity
analyst at KBL Richelieu, in Paris. ""Meanwhile, valuation multiples in sectors such as telecoms
and utilities are still very attractive."" Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index gained 0.6 percent,
Germany's DAX index rose 1.1 percent, and France's CAC 40 added
0.6 percent. Auto stocks gained ground, with Daimler up 2.7 percent and
BMW up 1.2 percent. French car parts maker Valeo, upgraded to
""buy"" by Merrill Lynch, surged 8.5 percent. Among the few stocks on the downside, Carrefour lost 3.7
percent, dragged lower by market talk that the retailer could
lower its profit outlook, according to traders. Carrefour
declined to comment.  LOSING STEAM? The FTSEurofirst 300 has risen 38 percent since reaching a
record low in early March, as better-than-feared macro data
fuelled recovery hopes. The sharp rebound has been led by banks, up 118 percent over
the past 3 months, and basic resources, up 85 percent, while
sectors seen as defensive have lagged behind, with telecoms up
only 6 percent and healthcare, up 13 percent. But a number of analysts and fund managers warn we could see
a period of consolidation after the recent sharp gains because,
despite a few ""green shoots"", there is still a lack of
visibility on the outlook for the world economy. ""Equities, credits and commodities, government bonds have
had a torrid time,"" said Paul Niven, F&C's head of asset
allocation. ""From here, with valuation broadly fair and limited scope
for upside surprises in economic and corporate newsflow, we see
the risks on equities and credits as much more finely balanced,""
Niven wrote in a note. So far this year, UK's FTSE 100 index is up 0.6 percent,
Germany's DAX index up 6.2 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 3.6
percent. ""The stabilisation of the macro situation we see through
data is now priced in. To move higher from here, we need real
signs of improvement, but they haven't come yet,"" said KBL

 (Adds details, comments on acquisitions, background) By Helen Massy-Beresford PARIS, June 9 (Reuters) - French car parts maker Valeo said
there were signs that destocking by carmakers was coming to an
end but confirmed a gloomy outlook for 2009 amid an
unprecedented industry crisis. ""We are noticing a convergence between the level of
production and that of sales, marking the probable end of
destocking by carmakers,"" new CEO Jacques Aschenbroich told the
company's annual shareholders' meeting in Paris on Tuesday. He confirmed the group's previous forecast of a 30 percent
drop in the market in the first half, and a 20 percent drop for
the year as a whole. Valeo shares jumped over five percent and closed up 4.38
percent for a gain this year of 25 percent, giving it a market
capitalisation of 1.035 billion euros ($1.44 billion). According to I/B/E/S, analysts are expecting Valeo to post
full-year sales of 7.3 billion euros, down eight percent, and an
EBIT operating loss of some 80 million euros with a net loss of
165 million. Aschenbroich said government scrapping incentives -- which
offer drivers cash bonuses for trading in old cars for newer,
greener models -- had a positive impact in March, while some
emerging markets, including China and Brazil, showed signs of
holding up in the face of the crisis. Aschenbroich reiterated the group would divest certain
non-strategic activities as and when market conditions allowed. Valeo would also look at acquisition opportunities, he said,
adding that there would be ""no taboos"" in terms of size of any
possible target, although the company would not have the
financial  resources for a large purchase on the order of a
billion or two billion euros by itself.  However, he was confident the board would support seeking
financing in the event of a good opportunity, he said. Asked if he was interested in the assets of U.S.-based
Delphi, Aschenbroich confirmed that there were ""one or
two things that could interest us"", but declined to specify which
assets. Valeo's biggest single shareholder, Pardus, has long
campaigned for Valeo to take on assets from Delphi or Visteon in
which it also has a large stake. Former chairman and chief
executive Thierry Morin fought this.  FIRST QUARTER SALES DOWN The group posted a 33.4 percent drop in first-quarter sales
in April, and pledged to step up cost-cutting plans. Fellow French car parts maker Faurecia saw sales plunge 38
percent in the first quarter. Valeo's AGM was marked by controversy as shareholders
followed a supervisory recommendation to vote against the
awarding of a ""golden parachute"" to Morin, who left in March
following ""strategic differences"". Valeo has since launched legal proceedings, after recording
equipment was found in its boardroom. The company will have to try to recover the 3.2 million euro
payout which has already been handed over to Morin.

342,"Apr 29, 2009 11:56AM ET",FACTBOX-Fiscal stimulus in G20 countries,nan," April 29 (Reuters) - Governments worldwide are rolling out
fiscal stimulus packages in the hope the public funds will boost
demand, limit job losses and prevent a deeper downturn. International Monetary Fund officials say that discretionary
fiscal stimulus so far amounts to around 2.0 percent of GDP for
2009 and 1.5 percent in 2010 at G20 level. The IMF published
updated estimates on April 26. http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/2009/042609.htm Russia tops the 2009 table with discretionary stimulus worth
4.1 percent of GDP, then comes China at 3.1 percent, South Korea
at 3.9 percent, Saudi Arabia at 3.3, China at 3.1, Japan at 2.4
Australia at 2.1 and the United States at 2.0 percent. The aggregate G20 stimulus figures are 0.2 percentage points
higher than estimates the IMF released in March, mainly because
of extra packages announced in Japan, South Korea and Russia. The IMF did not give revised impacts of the GDP impact in
its April 26 release but those of mid-March were as follows: -- aggregate G20 GDP gain from discretionary stimulus of
anywhere between 0.4 and 1.3 percentage points in 2009 and
0.1-0.2 percent in 2010 -- aggregate G20 GDP gain from total fiscal expansion (which
adds so-called automatic stabilisers to discretionary spending)
of 0.8-3.2 percentage points in 2010 and 0.1-0.9 in 2010. Below is a updated guide to fiscal stimulus programmes from
Reuters correspondents across the G20. Descriptions focus on
discretionary fiscal stimulus, or new public spending and tax
breaks aimed at boosting activity. In Europe, with a larger
welfare state, automatic stabilisers play a larger role
alongside discretionary spending.  
 JAPAN:
 * Size: 15.4 trillion yen ($154 billion), or 3.1 percent of the
GDP. The stimulus package would be paid for by issuing up to
$110 billion in new bonds.
 * Timeframe: Current and next fiscal year, up to March 2010
 * Focus: A range of subsidies, loans and other stimulus.
 * Rollout: Began October 2008, second, third packages were
rolled out In March though some spending still pending formal
parliament approval of state budget.

those replacing their old vehicles with new ones, but it needs
further discussion with the ruling party. It does not give the
total value of the proposed tax cuts.
-------------
INDIA:
 * Size: $4 billion worth in two packages, 0.4 percent of GDP

  (Adds details and background) STUTTGART, Germany, April 23 (Reuters) - Germany's Robert
Bosch, the world's biggest car parts group, will slash
jobs this year in Germany and abroad as its sales slump as much
as 15 percent amid a sector-wide crisis. ""For 2009, Bosch expects one of the most difficult years in
the company's history, with substantial risks to sales and
earnings,"" Chief Executive Franz Fehrenbach told a news
conference on Thursday, forecasting a loss before taxes. He said the recession this year will be severe, citing a
""marked sales decline"" in the first-quarter. He gave no more
details. Bosch will go beyond its current programme of shortening
work hours and instead reduce staff, he added. Bosch has already
cut 3,000 of its 282,000 employees abroad. The number of layoffs will increase ""significantly"",
Fehrenbach said. Bosch said it expects automotive production worldwide will
fall by at least 10 percent. The unlisted company has previously said sales at its
automotive technology operations, which generate about
two-thirds of overall sales, declined 7 percent last year. Its pretax profit last year fell to 940 million euros ($1.22
billion) from 3.8 billion, while revenues declined 2.6 percent
to 45.1 billion. It said net profit last year fell to 372 million euros from
2.85 billion in 2007. Rival European automotive suppliers Continental AG and Valeo
 have also been cutting jobs to try to weather the storm.

344,"Mar 24, 2009 06:48AM ET",UPDATE 1-French consumers cut spending as job losses accelerate,nan," (Adds details, economist quotes, background) By Anna Willard PARIS, March 24 (Reuters) - French shoppers cut spending at
the fastest pace in over a year in February, worried about
rising unemployment, while business confidence stuck at a record
low in March as bosses fretted about empty order books. Consumer spending on manufactured goods fell 2.0 percent
month-on-month, national statistics office INSEE said on
Tuesday, far worse than expectations for a fall of 0.8 percent
and the largest drop since January 2008. Purchases of household equipment fell, in line with the
slowing housing market, and clothing sales were also down after
a boost from sales and a cold snap in January. [ID:nPAB004715]
The January spending rise was revised down to 1.7 percent. Other data on Tuesday showed mounting job losses in March.
The Markit/CDAF composite purchasing managers' index showed
firms cut jobs at the fastest pace in the 10-year-old series,
casting doubt over the outlook for the months ahead.
[ID:nSAC014199] ""The main problem for the French economy is the increase in
unemployment and the decrease in confidence,"" said Xerfi
economist Alexander Law. ""The more people are worried, the less they are going to
spend ... We're really in that vicious circle at the moment. I
can't see the green shoots of recovery in the French economy."" Another INSEE report showed business morale in March stayed
at 68, the lowest point since that survey began in 1976, as
bosses fretted about empty order books. [ID:nPAB004716] ""The industrial outlook has remained very bad,"" INSEE said. ""Conditions remain very bad, there were expectations of a
pickup at the beginning of the year compared with a very bad
fourth quarter and we haven't had it,"" said Jean-Louis Mourier,
economist at Aurel Leven. Analysts said the economy might get a slight bounce in the
months ahead as companies started to build up their stocks. ""But that is pretty technical. It's not restocking, it's
just less destocking. Aside from that, it's difficult to be too
optimistic,"" Mourier said. INSEE is expecting the economy to shrink 1.5 percent in the
first quarter which would mean a recession after the 1.2 percent
contraction in the last three months of 2008.  STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE The consumer spending report showed purchases of cars rose
0.2 percent, the third monthly increase. Economists said this
was likely due to a 1000 euro government subsidy to encourage
households to swap their old cars for new ones. Many French industrial companies are struggling to survive
the financial crisis, forcing the government to step in to try
and save jobs. It made available 6 billion euros in loans for car companies
and took a stake in struggling car parts manufacturer Valeo. But the government's policies, which included a 26 billion
investment-led stimulus plan have angered unions and ordinary
French. They say President Nicolas Sarkozy is only helping
companies -- and their well-paid bosses -- and must do more to
help consumers and prevent job cuts. Up to 3 million people joined protests against his economic
policies last week, stirring the debate about whether Sarkozy
should announce new steps to boost consumption.  But economists say even the drop in inflation is not enough
to encourage reluctant consumers to spend. ""All of which adds to the sense that, in this context,
measures to stimulate the economy through consumption are
ineffective, while at the same time proving extremely expensive
for public finances,"" said Nicolas Bouzou, economist at Asteres. ""You can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink.""
