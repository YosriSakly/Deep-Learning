Les Bleues' star players are fast becoming household names.TF1, France's main broadcaster for the tournament, had expected the team's opening match to draw up to 5 million viewers. Instead, numbers peaked at 10.9 million, while almost 1 million followed the game on Canal+, a pay-TV unit of  Vivendi  (PA:VIV). TF1, owned by family-controlled conglomerate  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), described the numbers as a French record for a women's soccer match.But the records did not stop there -- in France's second group game against Norway, domestic viewer numbers spiked to 11 million on TF1 - on par with the number of people who watched the men's opening matches in 2018. The French women play Nigeria on Monday in their last group game before the knock-out stages. The surprising level of interest prompted TF1 to drive up the cost of advertising slots by 50-60 percent the day after France's first match, Le Parisien newspaper reported.Thirty-second slots during the half-time break of France's group stage matches, initially slated at 73,000 euros, now cost 116,000 euros, it said.The surge in viewer numbers extends beyond the French games. England's match against arch rival Argentina drew nearly 1.5 million viewers on TF1, while up to 1.1 million people have tuned in to watch the United States. Women's soccer is steadily growing in popularity in many parts of the world.Soccer's governing body FIFA has said it has received a record number of expressions of interest for hosting the next women's tournament, in 2023, including a joint bid by South Korea and North Korea football associations.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

3,"May 07, 2019 07:35AM ET",French tycoon Niel to sell mobile towers to Cellnex for $3 billion,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Andrés GonzálezPARIS/MADRID (Reuters) - French tycoon Xavier Niel has agreed a 2.7 billion euro ($3.02 billion) deal to sell mobile towers in France, Italy and Switzerland to Cellnex as he seeks to bolster the finances of his telecoms group Iliad. Iliad burned through 1.44 billion euros in cash in 2018, twice as much as in 2017, and has lost half its market value over the last year.The deal by billionaire Niel, considered a maverick in France's telecoms sector, follows a similar one by French rival  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom in 2017 under which it sold about 3,000 mobile sites to Cellnex for 900 million euros. For Spanish towers group Cellnex, the acquisitions of thousands of new sites in the three countries allow it to extend its reach in Europe, where it has grown considerably over the past few years and is now seen as a key player in a potential consolidation of the telecoms infrastructure market. Iliad shares were 5.6 percent up at 0926 GMT, while Cellnex's were 6.6 percent higher. ""This is quite a sensible move for them for two reasons: one is that it gives Iliad the financing to roll out in Italy, second ... Cellnex will end up having much better utilization of the infrastructure,"" said Karen Egan, an analyst at Enders.Iliad, which has shaken up the French mobile market since 2012 with low-cost services, is facing aggressive fixed and mobile discounts from rivals in its home country.Part of the proceeds from the towers sale will help to cut its debt and invest in networks in both France and Italy, it said. The deal was announced hours before Iliad's investor day in Paris on Tuesday.TRANSFORMATIONALAnalysts say the 2.7 billion euro investment is transformational for Cellnex, increasing by 75 percent earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA) and doubling its recurrent leveraged free cash flow. It would allow the Spanish group to take control of Iliad's 5,700 sites in France and the 2,200 in Italy. It would also take control of the mobile towers of Salt, the Swiss telecom operator privately-owned by Niel. Cellnex also intends to spend an additional 1.35 billion euros on the roll-out of 2,500 new sites in France, 1,000 sites in Italy and 500 in Switzerland between 2020 and 2027.  ""This is a big deal for Cellnex and materially increases the scale. We further believe there remains further opportunities for Cellnex to continue to do deals,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in a note to clients. Cellnex Chief Executive Tobias Martinez said on a conference call Britain's CTIL would be an appealing target but reiterated it could not afford to invest in France's TDF, which Spanish newspaper Expansion said it was considering.Iliad, whose first-quarter sales grew by 7.7 percent to 1.29 billion euros, said it targeted a return to revenue growth in France in 2019 and an acceleration of its core operating profit growth in the second-half of the year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

12,"Feb 21, 2019 05:13AM ET",France's Orange strikes cautious tone as French price war lingers,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - Orange, France's number one telecoms operator, struck a cautious tone for 2019 due to a protracted price war in its home country and few chances of a merger between its rivals that could improve market conditions.The tough competitive landscape prompted Chief Executive Stephane Richard to say he did not have enough visibility on operations to guarantee a dividend above a floor price of 70 euro cents per share in 2020, depressing shares in the company.""We don't say that we will not grow the dividend,"" Richard said on a call with analysts. ""We say that today we want to have a better visibility on what we can achieve on 2019 ... to make the final decision.""Orange shares were down 1.6 percent at 0931 GMT.The group said it expected core operating profit to grow at a slower pace in 2019 than 2018, despite good performances in its home country and second-biggest market Spain. That guidance may further fuel scepticism shown by investors over the past few months about Europe's telecoms sector, which has underperformed compared with major benchmark indexes. ""Today's competitive environment has intensified and shows no sign of waning, so it inevitably has an impact on our capacity to generate growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez said on a call with reporters, referring to France. Orange and domestic rivals Iliad,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom and Altice Europe's SFR are in a race to win customers for their fixed and mobile businesses, while also having to spend billions of euros on upgrading their networks.HEAVY DISCOUNTS Iliad triggered the price war in 2012 when it offered its low-cost mobile services, with direct consequences on its competitors' margins. But heavy discounts are now also seen in the broadband business.The prospect of further spending to buy radio frequencies for the deployment of the fifth-generation of mobile technology is also weighing on telecoms stocks. Several attempts to cut the number of French telecom operators from four to three, with an expected positive impact on prices, have failed, and Fernandez is not expecting such a deal to happen any time soon. ""It would be a big surprise if it happened right now,"" he said. Bouygues's CEO echoed that sentiment on Thursday in a news conference following publication of group results. ""We're not having any talks with anyone,"" Martin Bouygues told reporters, referring to his telecom business. However Orange posted a higher-than-expected quarterly operating profit, mainly driven by increased revenues in France and Spain and cost cuts. Adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) rose by 1.4 percent on a comparable basis to 3.33 billion euros ($3.8 billion), above market expectations for growth of 0.6 percent.Richard said he would present a new strategic plan dubbed Vision 2025 later this year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Feb 06, 2019 01:48PM ET",French Senate rejects tougher telecoms controls despite U.S. Huawei warning,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French Senate rejected on Wednesday proposed legislation aimed at toughening checks on telecoms equipment, following a U.S. warning about Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.The new legislation was a last-minute addition by the government to a wide-ranging corporate law and would have required telecom operators to seek formal approval for the use of certain kinds of equipment considered to be particularly sensitive for spying or sabotage risks. In justification of their vote against the amendment, several senators stressed that the government did not offer them sufficient time to properly discuss the matter, which they recognized as crucial and strategic. ""We haven't been able to do our work as members of parliament,"" said Senator Elisabeth Lamure, who is also vice-chair of the upper house's committee for economic affairs. The rejection by the Senate means the government will need to find another bill to pass the provision, which could delay its implementation by several months. ""The government will find other legislation to raise up this issue,"" an official at the French finance ministry said ahead of the Senate vote in anticipation that the amendment would be voted down. Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, is facing international scrutiny over its ties with the Chinese government and allegations that Beijing could use its technology for spying, which Huawei denies.The U.S. Justice Department has also charged Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran and with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc.The future deployment of the fifth-generation mobile technology has raised concerns in the government, as two of France's main telecoms operators,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom and Altice Europe's SFR Group, are already using Huawei's equipment for their network. ""The move from 4G to 5G changes many things at a technical level. It means that the most sensitive information are not only in the core networks but also in the antennas,"" said Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in an interview with France 2 television before the vote in the Senate. ""We must protect this sensitive information.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

15,"Feb 01, 2019 02:25PM ET",Altice gears up for Portugal cable network sale: sources,nan,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Andrés González and Gwénaëlle BarzicLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Debt-burdened telecom carrier Altice Europe is gearing up to sell a stake in its high-speed fiber network business in Portugal, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, with an auction process expected to kick off within a fortnight.Altice, which took control of Portugal Telecom in 2015, is looking to replicate its recent sale of a 49.99 percent stake in French fiber optic business SFR FTTH to three investment funds for 1.8 billion euros.The group, whose founder is billionaire Patrick Drahi, has hired Lazard to sound out potential bidders including U.S. funds KKR and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Infrastructure Partners, the three sources said.Information packages on the Portuguese network are expected to be dispatched in the next couple of weeks detailing how Altice will split costs and margins between its telecom services division and cable network in Portugal, the sources said.Morgan Stanley's infrastructure arm bought 75 percent of Altice's Portuguese towers business last year in tandem with Horizon Equity Partners and it is seen as a strong contender in the upcoming sale, the sources said, cautioning that no deal was certain.Other possible bidders include investment funds Ardian, Macquarie Group and I Squared Capital which tried to buy a stake in Altice's French cable unit last year but lost to a consortium of Allianz (DE:ALVG) Capital Partners, AXA Investment Managers and OMERS Infrastructure.A spokesman for Altice Portugal was not immediately available for comment while Lazard, Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Ardian declined to comment. Macquarie and I Squared Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Altice is restructuring to revive its fortunes after growing rapidly in recent years through a series of acquisitions.It June it raised about 2.5 billion euros ($2.86 billion)from selling stakes in its telecoms towers businesses in France and Portugal.It also pursued a spin-off of its American unit, Altice USA, letting Patrick Drahi maintain control of the European and U.S. operations while he sees through a turnaround in Europe.Drahi needs to regain market confidence after a steep fall in Altice's share price heightened concerns about its ability to repay its 30 billion euros of debt.But he also needs to shore up Altice's cash reserves to take part in France's 5G telecoms frequencies auction which is expected to start in the autumn, with licenses likely to be awarded at the start of 2020.France's four main telecoms operators Orange,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom, Altice Europe's SFR and Iliad regularly compete in costly spectrum auctions, which allow wireless carriers to develop networks."

France's four main telecoms operators Orange,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom, Altice Europe's SFR and Iliad regularly compete in costly spectrum auctions, which allow wireless carriers to develop networks. ""The government will fix the political framework in spring. Arcep (the telecoms regulator) will then establish the specific requirements, which will be certified in autumn,"" Pannier-Runacher told Le Figaro.""The auction will then be launched with attributions at the start of 2020,"" she added.Investors are concerned about the potential hefty price French telecom operators could end up paying in the auction amid a protracted pricing war that is weighing on profit margins. Italy, one of the first European countries to offer frequencies for 5G services, stunned markets by raising a bumper 6.5 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for state coffers in its auction.""There's a fine balance between state budget issues and telecom operator's financial capacities to buy frequencies and then deploy a network,"" Pannier-Runacher said. The junior minister denied new legislation to increase controls of telecoms infrastructure was aimed at Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei.""There's no such hidden agenda,"" she said. ""We need to both remain vigilant on critical equipments and acknowledge the quality of Huawei's equipments.""The United States has shut Chinese vendors out of government contracts on security grounds. Huawei denies its equipment includes 'back doors' open to cyber-espionage.Asked about Huawei in a separate interview with French newspaper Les Echos, the head of Arcep, Sebastien Soriano, said the 5G network could be deployed even with the banning of some equipment makers.""It's absolutely not incompatible,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

24,"Dec 04, 2018 09:46AM ET",France's Iliad seeks to revive sales with high-end set-top box,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - Telecom operator Iliad unveiled on Tuesday a new high-end set-up box with luxury audio speakers and embedded video applications which it sees reviving sluggish sales in France. Iliad's triangle-shaped white box, dubbed Freebox Delta, includes a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscription and Amazon's voice assistant Alexa among its key features, on top of six audio speakers developed by French luxury manufacturer Devialet.The model, which also has improved internet speed and data storage, comes eight years after the previous set-top box boosted sales for Iliad, which pioneered offers bundling television, internet and voice services. ""Our idea is to offer a product that is unique and adds value to the Freebox we invented several years ago,"" Iliad's founder and majority-owner Xavier Niel told reporters. Iliad's previous set-top boxes all played the role of cash-cows for the telecoms group, helping finance the company's low-cost mobile offers since obtaining a license in France in 2012. The protracted price war that followed has weighed on mobile revenues and the margins of its rivals  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom, Altice Europe's SFR and Orange. But the fierce competition has now extended to the fixed business and started to bite Iliad which lost subscribers in the second and third quarters in its broadband and mobile businesses.The stock was up by 4 percent at 1408 GMT, reacting positively to the presentation of the new box. It has shed about 36 percent of its value since the start of the year. The Freebox Delta is offered at 49.99 euros ($57) per month, roughly 10 euros more than the previous version. But the real price tag includes a four-year subscription to the embedded Devialet speakers, costing 10 euros more per month. The new box is therefore about 20 euros more than the average triple-play equivalents offered by Iliad's rivals, including market leader Orange.Yet the added services, which include an alarm system and a camera that detects suspicious movements, are weighing on margins, Niel said. ""We're losing a tiny bit on our margin but this is deliberate and voluntary because this is our DNA and this shows what we're capable of doing,"" he said.Niel declined to provide a sales target for the Freebox Delta but confirmed the 2020 target of an operating free cash flow of about 1 billion euros in France.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

30,"Oct 26, 2018 02:00AM ET",French regulator faces thorny dilemma in 5G spectrum auction,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - French telecom operators are set to pay a hefty price to buy 5G radio frequencies in 2019, but authorities are seeking to avoid bleeding them dry, the head of the country's telecoms regulator told Reuters.Italy, one of the first European countries to offer frequencies for 5G services, stunned markets by raising a bumper 6.5 billion euros ($7.39 billion) for state coffers in its fifth-generation mobile auction, sending shivers down telecom investors' spines.""In the past, the financial argument may have been important, perhaps very important, but opinions have changed,"" said Sebastien Soriano, the head of France's telecoms authority Arcep.""There's room to be inventive. Now, we need to find the right ideas and that's not easy,"" he added.Cash-strapped countries in Europe have typically used mobile spectrum auctions, which provide raw material for wireless carriers to develop networks, as an easy money-maker in times of low state revenues.But concerns are growing over risks they could hamper much-needed investments on new mobile infrastructure, which could connect everything from autonomous vehicles to public transportation and smart objects under 5G technology.DIFFICULT EQUATIONFor the next spectrum auction, Arcep plans to essentially use the 3.5 GHz band out of three on the table for 5G (1.4 GHz, 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz). But there might not be enough airwaves for everyone, Soriano said, and that scarcity could eventually drive up auction prices.""As long as we've not solved this problem about the quantity of frequencies that we have at our disposal ... there's a difficult equation to balance,"" he said.""I can't say that Italy is a counter-example as long as I haven't found the solution so that we don't do the same thing.""One thing is certain: there will be no reiteration of the ""new deal"" under which French wireless carriers Orange, Altice Europe's SFR,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom and Iliad promised to spend 3 billion euros in rolling out a 4G network to ensure there are no coverage gaps by 2020.""Sadly, we can't make a comparison with the new deal in the sense that it's a new attribution (of frequencies),"" Soriano said.France still has a few months to find the answer to this equation and that work starts with a public consultation on Friday about the attribution of frequencies, which will run until Dec. 19.The last spectrum auction in 2015 raised 2.8 billion euros for French state coffers.($1 = 0.8794 euro)"

33,"Oct 19, 2018 05:42AM ET",Weak earnings and EU-Italy budget clash drive European stocks down,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European stocks tumbled again on Friday as a showdown between Italy's populist government and the European Union heated up and weak results from  Michelin  and  Bouygues  reignited investors' concerns about auto and construction stocks.Euro zone stocks (STOXX50E) fell 0.8 percent while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.4 percent and Italy's top stock index (FTMIB) slid 1.2 percent.Brussels sent Rome a letter demanding an explanation for its budget plans, calling them an ""unprecedented"" breach of EU fiscal rules. Italy's bank stocks index (FTIT8300) fell 2.9 percent to a 22-month low as government bonds were sold off. It was set for its fourth straight week of declines.A crop of results, some with negative outlooks, suggested growth slowing in China, car demand falling, and issues in the construction sector.""Companies that disappoint are always more harshly punished but, given the trend in the market currently, reactions are stronger than usual,"" said Emmanuel Cau, European equity strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). Shares in tire maker Michelin (PA:MICP) tumbled 6.7 percent after it cut its sales outlook and downgraded its market growth forecasts, blaming slowing Chinese car demand and new emissions testing regulations.Its German rival Continental (DE:CONG) fell 3 percent to the bottom of the DAX, and the autos and parts sector as a whole (SXAP) sank 2.9 percent. ""This warning provides a negative read across to all tire makers (weaker market volume and higher input costs),"" said UBS analysts.CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS French conglomerate Bouygues (PA:BOUY) fell 6.5 percent after cutting its profit outlook due to difficulties in its construction businesses, also reporting a shrinking margin due to problems with contracts and France's rail strikes.""This was particularly surprising two weeks after a bullish construction capital markets day,"" wrote  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts.British construction equipment rental firm Ashtead (L:AHT) fell 4.5 percent in sympathy.Swedish builder Skanska (ST:SKAb) fell 9 percent after saying it had booked charges of 1.3 billion crowns ($140 million) in the third quarter relating to construction projects in the United States.Overall, the construction and materials sector (SXOP) fell 0.3 percent, its second day of declines after being hit on Thursday by a profit warning from Heidelbergcement.""We have a negative view on this sector - it's very sensitive to emerging markets and China, and we're quite cautious on those areas,"" said Barclays' Cau. ""Construction is penalized both by a slowing economy and by rising raw materials costs.""Sopra Steria (PA:SOPR) was the top STOXX 600 faller, dropping 26 percent after cutting its 2018 revenue forecast due to a contract loss in banking software. ""The profit warning will probably trigger around 15 percent EPS downgrades and obviously a bit of an additional hit from a share price perspective because of derating as well,"" said Georgios Kertsos, an analyst at Berenberg.""It's probably a bit too harsh a hit,"" he added, saying more detail was needed from the company, which is in a quiet period before its third-quarter results on Oct. 25.Overall, analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for European earnings quite sharply in recent weeks, but Barclays' Cau said he thought estimates for 2019 earnings growth were still too high and could decline further.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

34,"Sep 26, 2018 12:54PM ET",European shares stay at four-week high before expected Fed rate hike,nan,"By Julien Ponthus and Danilo MasoniLONDON (Reuters) - European shares held their ground near 4-week highs on Wednesday before a widely expected rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index ended up 0.3 percent, while London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) and Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) both advanced around 0.1 percent.""I don't expect much to be happening before the Fed,"" said ABR managing director Harry Scheper. He added that volumes were low, as they typically are ahead of U.S. rate decisions.The statement from the U.S. central bank is due at 1800 GMT.European shares have been under pressure this summer but they have rebounded over the last few days on hopes the U.S. could resume trade talks with China after the two countries moved ahead with new tariffs on each other's exports.Easing worries over Brexit and the Italian budget, due on Thursday, helped bring investors' attention back to the region's cheaply valued equity market. Fresh deal-making activity also buoyed the market.On Wednesday the STOXX was supported by gains in defensive sectors like consumer staples and healthcare, while cyclical stocks that drove most of the recent gains suffered.Basic materials stocks led sectoral losers as after copper prices fell, weighed down by a firmer dollar ahead of the expected rate hike in the U.S. [MET/L]Oil stocks also fell as investors took profit following strong gains this week driven by crude oil prices rising to four-year highs at above $80 a barrel.  BP  (L:BP) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) were down 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent respectively.Autos were in focus on news that carmakers had triggered some Brexit contingency plans in Britain. After initial losses, their sectoral index (SXAP) recovered to end up 0.3 percent. Among top movers, Indivior (L:INDV) declined 16 percent after the drugmaker revised its full-year earnings guidance as it sharply lowered its revenue expectation for opioid addiction drug Sublocade.France's  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) rose 2.7 percent after the stock was upgraded to overweight by JP Morgan. Belgium's Telenet (BR:TNET) fell 2.1 percent after a rating cut by  Barclays  (LON:BARC). Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) lost 1.4 percent. The company dismissed speculation that it might seek a merger as ""fictions"" after media reports suggested Germany's biggest lender might seek tie ups with Switzerland's UBS (S:UBSG) or German peer Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).UBS ended little changed and Commerzbank eased 0.6 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

40,"Aug 30, 2018 05:04AM ET",China trade fears end European shares' recovery,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Thursday, tracking a decline in Asian trading as weakness in Chinese markets eclipsed optimism that a NAFTA deal could be struck by Friday's deadline.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) extended early losses to 0.5 percent by 0830 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI), which is sensitive to China due to its prominence as a German export market, dropped 0.9 percent. Chinese stocks fell after a Reuters poll showed activity in the factory sector likely slowed for the third straight month in August amid uncertainty over an escalating trade war with the United States.In Europe, trade-sensitive mining stocks (SXPP) tumbled 1.3 percent and autos (SXAP) fell 0.7 percent. ""It's a balancing act with on the one hand relatively positive momentum behind NAFTA, but when the focus turns to China and trade war it doesn't seem like an end is in sight because any escalation plays to Trump's rhetoric of how he's protecting U.S. prosperity and jobs,"" said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips Investment Management. Earnings reports caused some sharp moves in individual stocks.Shares in Europe's largest property company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (AS:URW) fell 5 percent even though the company reported a boost to profits from its acquisition of Australian shopping centre giant Westfield.Traders said a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note weighed on the stock after analysts at the U.S. bank downgraded their view on the European property industry to ""in-line"" from ""attractive"".""For almost every property stock in Europe we expect a lower total return profile compared to what it has been delivering,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. They also said rising inflation and bond yields would increase differentiation in the sector and leverage would become more of a focus.UK commercial property firm Intu (L:INTUP) fell 3.6 percent after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underweight from equal-weight, and peer  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) fell 4.1 percent.  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) lost 3.8 percent after a Morgan Stanley downgrade.Real estate (SX86P) was Europe's worst-performing sector, down 1.3 percent.Shares in Swedish radiation therapy gear maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb) fell 6.6 percent after it reported an unexpected drop in first-quarter operating profit. Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) was a rare gainer, up 3.1 percent after the French conglomerate stuck to its full year outlook for rising profitability as its telecoms division improved.The prospect of Bouygues Telecom gaining market share sent shares in rival  Iliad  (PA:ILD), a telecoms disrupter offering cut-price contracts, tumbling 6.4 percent.Bringing up the rear was Swiss asset manager GAM (S:GAMH) which sank a further 8.1 percent, hitting its lowest in more than nine years and taking its year-to-date losses to 51 percent. GAM shares have sold off sharply since the firm suspended a top director and suspended, then liquidated, some bond funds. Overall in Europe, escalating trade disputes have driven cyclical mining and autos sectors down this year while healthcare and technology take the lead. With the second-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, companies in the MSCI Europe index (MIPO00000PEU) have delivered 10.9 percent year-on-year earnings growth in euro terms.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

44,"Jul 07, 2018 11:07AM ET","Orange says open to French telecom tie-up talks, not an instigator",nan,"By Pascale Denis and Sarah WhiteAIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (Reuters) - French telecoms firms Orange (PA:ORAN) is open to discussing potential tie-ups with other operators in its home market but is not likely to be the instigator of consolidation in the sector, financial chief Ramon Fernandez said. An aggressive price war between French telecoms companies has revived expectations in recent months that the sector, dominated by Orange,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom, Altice Europe (AS:ATCA) and  Iliad  (PA:ILD) was ripe for consolidation.Fernandez said in an interview with Reuters that Orange was in a strong position and could afford to see how other maneuvers in the sector played out. ""There is no urgency for us for this scenario of consolidation to materialize,"" Fernandez said on the sidelines of an economic conference in Aix-en-Provence, southern France. ""Our position is to say that the door is always open to potential discussions,"" he said, adding, however, that it was improbable that Orange would try to trigger those talks. A previous bid by Orange to buy Bouygues Telecom and forge a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed in 2016. It was complicated in part by a stand-off between the French government - which has a 23 percent stake in Orange - and billionaire Martin Bouygues over the clout the billionaire, and head of the Bouygues, would have gained in the merged group, according to sources at the time. ""The previous scenario under which Orange was in the driving seat is very, very unlikely (to repeat itself),"" Fernandez said. ""That said, there's always room in a car for several passengers, so we'll have to see if at some stage we should take one of those seats.""Other French operators have signaled they could make a move. Altice Europe's French unit SFR was approached last month by Bouygues, two sources close to the matter have told Reuters, confirming earlier reports by French newspaper Le Monde. Orange's Fernandez said that consolidation would have to happen at some point, across Europe as well as in France. ""In France there's no room for four operators ... This is an industry that needs a lot of capital, you need to invest a lot to roll out next generation networks,"" he said, adding that powerful competition from the United States and Asia was also a factor.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

45,"Jul 06, 2018 05:02AM ET",European shares steady as world braces for trade war,nan,"By Julien PonthusLONDON (Reuters) - European shares opened in positive territory on Friday as the trade dispute between the United States and China escalated with U.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports taking effect and China immediately retaliating.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.3 percent by 0830 GMT while Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) rose 0.2 percent. Chinese stock markets also rose in late trading after initial losses close to two-year lows in the morning session. ""We're in a typical 'buy the rumor, sell the news',"" scenario, said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, strategist at Makor Capital Markets, when asked why markets were not falling giving the trade dispute was moving unequivocally toward a trade war. According to Barbier de la Serre, many investors still want to believe that the European Union will stay on the sidelines of the trade war or that the U.S. confrontation with China is just a negotiating posture, which will not lead to a fall in global trade. He also noted that with high hopes for the new corporate earnings season beginning in less than two weeks, many traders were reluctant to short European stocks. According to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, second-quarter earnings for STOXX 600 companies are expected to increase 8.7 percent from the same period last year. Among individual stocks, shares in Britain's  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) posted the worst performance and fell close to 9 percent after it rejected a takeover offer from Echostar. Swedish lock maker  Assa Abloy  (ST:ASSAb) also fell sharply, down 7 percent after reporting a one-off costs of 6 billion crowns ($686 million).Altice Europe (AS:ATCA) jumped 4.7 percent as speculation about potential mergers within the French telecoms are resurfacing and French conglomerate  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) said it was ready to seize opportunities to beef up its telecoms business. Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) was up 3.4 percent after its CEO offered to step down, bowing to growing investor pressure for a more radical restructuring of the group. Shares in French investment group Eurazeo (PA:EURA) jumped 4.5 percent, the STOXX 600's best performance, after HSBC lifted its rating for the stock.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

47,"Jun 18, 2018 04:20PM ET",Exclusive: KKR close to signing deal for Altice's telecom towers - sources,nan,"By Andrés González and Pamela BarbagliaMADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR (N:KKR) is close to buying a stake in the telecom towers business of Altice (AS:ATCA), three sources told Reuters, a deal that will help the telecoms and cable group to pay down debt and reshape its European operations.Under the deal, which is being finalised, KKR will use its infrastructure fund to take a minority interest in Altice's towers subsidiary in France, the sources said.The U.S. buyout group has trumped rival bids from private equity firm Blackstone (N:BX) and a consortium led by the infrastructure investment arms of insurers Allianz (DE:ALVG) and  Axa  (PA:AXAF) which also made it to the final stages of the auction, the sources said.KKR declined to comment while Altice and the other bidders were not immediately available for comment.Altice, whose debt equals more than twice its annual revenues, is rushing to finalize a series of non-core disposals involving telecoms towers in France and Portugal and its entire operations in the Dominican Republic.Its founder Patrick Drahi has pledged to shift the company's focus from large acquisitions to sales growth and debt management.The group's French masts could be valued at about 4 billion euros, according to estimates by RBC analysts, representing a multiple of 20 times its core earnings.Altice's SFR division has around 20,000 tower sites in France although some of these assets belong to a joint venture platform with French mobile firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY).The tower auction, which kicked off earlier this year, attracted interest from several heavyweight investors with Allianz and Axa joining a consortium with Digital Colony and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the sources said.For KKR this is not the first minority deal in the telecom towers industry. Last year, it bought a 40 percent stake in Telefonica's telecom masts subsidiary Telxius for 1.3 billion euros.As part of the Telxius deal, KKR also gained significant exposure to an international network with approximately 65,000 kilometers of submarine fiber optic cables.Altice's reorganization, which involves the spin off of Altice's U.S. arm, is expected to complete toward the end of June and proceeds from the various auctions will be used to cut debt which rose to around $60 billion following a series of big ticket deals. In the United States, Drahi spent $28 billion in 2015 to buy cable companies Suddenlink and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC), and even flirted with a $185 billion bid for cable giant Charter.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

49,"Jun 03, 2018 01:00PM ET",Foreign companies struggle in cash-strapped Turkmenistan,nan,"By Olzhas Auyezov and Ece ToksabayALMATY/ANKARA (Reuters) - Some foreign companies in Turkmenistan are struggling to make sales and collect payments as economic pressures mount in large part because of a sharp drop in the Central Asian nation's crucial gas exports.There is little economic data beyond official statistics that paint a picture of sustained growth, but some foreign executives say hard currency shortages have crippled the state-dominated economy.Turkmenistan, with the world's fourth-largest gas reserves, is still awarding contracts to foreign and domestic firms, but some projects have stalled and the International Monetary Fund says it should cut spending or devalue its currency, the manat .""The government has run out of financial resources, and it hasn't been paying for finished contracts, let alone being able to pay for new ones,"" said Oguzhan Cakiroglu, board member at Cakiroglu Grup, a Turkish metals and construction company that has now stopped operating in Turkmenistan.Ashgabat's problems began in 2016 when Russia, its main gas buyer, stopped buying, citing pricing disputes and shifts in the global energy market.Exports to China have failed to offset the loss of Russian sales and the country's total export revenue dropped to $8.0-8.5 billion in 2016-17, about half of what it was receiving between 2000 and 2014.Graphic on Turkmenistan economy: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LevVc8In response, the government of President Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov has gradually tightened foreign exchange controls to conserve hard currency for priority projects.On the black market, the manat has fallen to 17-18 per dollar from 13-14 at the beginning of this year and 7 in late 2016. The official rate is 3.5 per dollar.Private local companies such as importers of consumer goods receive only a fraction of the dollars they request, Turkmen entrepreneurs say. And, according to Cakiroglu, the government itself has trouble paying foreign contractors.""The government has not been paying companies for more than three years, and it's pushing the market into a more troubled situation, with a shortage of dollars pushing black market prices to 3-4 times the official exchange rate,"" he said.""We have pending payments of around a few million dollars, but we have been waiting for 4-5 years for this payment,"" Cakiroglu said. ""So we've stopped operating completely in Turkmenistan.""He declined to say what reasons the government had given for delaying payment.Another Turkish contractor, Polimeks, which in 2016 completed a $2.3 billion air terminal shaped like a giant white falcon in Ashgabat, has stopped work on a highway to connect the capital to the Caspian port of Turkmenbashi.Polimeks declined to comment on its relationship with Turkmenistan, which has since made no official announcements on the highway project. The foreign ministry and the Turkmen embassy in Ankara did not reply to questions about the government's debt to foreign companies.Instead of providing investment figures as it does for other countries, a page on Turkmenistan on the website of Turkey's Economy Ministry reads like a warning.Risks such as ""tax audits carried out like sudden raids"", visa denials and ""the expropriation of certain investments made in previous years"" are deterring foreign investment, it said.The ministry said payments to Turkish contractors are often delayed and they have problems transferring foreign currency from their bank accounts.""NEW BALL GAME""Turkish contractors are probably owed the most by Ashgabat, because Turkey has for years been the main source of Turkmen imports and invested $1.5 billion in Turkmenistan between 2002 and 2016. But other companies have taken a hit.Two Belarussian government sources told Reuters Ashgabat has not fully paid a Belarussian state-owned company for building a fertilizer plant launched in March 2017. One source said the outstanding debt was $52 million, the other said it was ""a significant sum"".DRC International, a U.S.-based technical procurement and distribution company for the mining, oil and gas and construction industries, has been in Ashgabat since 2004.""We got some good traction in the early days. The largest project was in 2015 with Hyundai Amco on the navy shipyard, which was a great success for both Hyundai and DRC,"" DRC chief executive Steve Crabtree said in an email.""But sadly, those days are far behind us and it's a whole new ball game,"" he said. ""I have cut expenses, replaced management, and keep pushing forward. I'm hopeful that conditions change for the country and we can get back to supporting great projects.""An executive of another Western company who asked not to be named said his firm, which used to supply oil and gas equipment, had shut its Turkmen office late last year.The executive said Turkmen customers could no longer buy his firm's products due to foreign currency shortages.A Turkmen emigre, who requested anonymity to protect relatives at home, said more and more of his contacts were looking for work abroad, with Turkey a top choice.According to Turkey's interior ministry, the number of Turkmens with Turkish short-term residency permits - separate from student and family permits - more than doubled last year to 25,693.In an unusual move, Berdymukhamedov in March ordered the central bank to extend $3 billion in soft loans to the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan, a body made up of local companies, to build a highway and a fertilizer plant. The Union did not reply to a request for comment.Previously, the government awarded such contracts to foreign companies. But some foreign firms continue to get Turkmen contracts.Korean firm Hyundai said it was working on a $3 billion petrochemicals facility and was in talks about two more projects in the same sector worth $4.8 billion in total.Hyundai said it had no difficulties with payments from Turkmenistan and described the government as supportive.French firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Construction also said it had no particular difficulties there. It secured fresh contracts in February for a conference center, a hotel and two bank buildings, whose value it declined to disclose.NEW MARKETSTurkmenistan, which routinely reports gross domestic product growth of over 6 percent, plans to open new gas export markets by the end of 2019 via a pipeline to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, currently under construction.Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) declined to comment on the prospects of resuming Turkmen gas purchases.Turkmenistan is trying to diversify exports by processing some of its gas into fuel and chemicals. It also opened a new $1.5 billion Caspian port this month. In the meantime, its policy options are either devaluing the manat or cutting government spending, said Juha Kahkonen, deputy director of the International Monetary Fund's Middle East and Central Asia Department.Reserves built up in better times will help the government handle the pressures, Kahkonen told Reuters, ""but clearly it needs to make adjustments in its policies"".Turkmenistan has run a double-digit current account deficit for the three past years, according to IMF data, although this year the gap is projected to narrow to 9 percent of GDP or $3.8 billion, from last year's 11.5 percent, or $4.4 billion.Hans Timmer, chief economist for Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank, said Turkmenistan's current account deficit ""is not really sustainable in the long run and foreign currency shortages reduce productive potential"".The World Bank and the Ashgabat government have had ""a more intense relationship"" over the last couple of years, Timmer said, but Turkmenistan must do more before the bank can give it financial support, in particular by providing better economic data and ensuring transparency.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Richard, who also serves as Orange's chief executive officer, faces legal charges, which he denies. But Orange said in a statement it was renewing Richard's mandate as a member of its board, in anticipation of renewing his position as chairman of the board.Shareholders will vote on renewing his mandate at the company's annual general meeting in May, Orange said.Richard faces charges over payments to businessman Bernard Tapie of about 400 million euros ($494 million) from public funds. The payments were made in 2008, when Richard was chief of staff to Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister. He denies any wrongdoing.Last month, Richard got the backing of French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said Richard's contract should be renewed. The French state is Orange's biggest shareholder.In December, Richard told investors that he would invest in upgrading networks rather than in content.Richard is credited with improving Orange's results in the fiercely competitive French market, where it contends with the likes of  Bouygues  Telecom (PA:BOUY), Altice (AS:ATCA) and  Iliad  (PA:ILD).France's telecoms and media industries face the challenge of dealing with contrasting demands from customers who want both fast Internet services and appealing media content.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Denormandie said the three-year rollout plan would bring 4G coverage to more than 10,000 towns and villages currently served by either 2G or 3G networks.(This verson of the story has been refiled to add dropped ""billion"" in headline)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

62,"Dec 18, 2017 01:43PM ET",Kremlin-backed broadcaster launches French language news channel in wary Paris,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - The Kremlin-funded Russian broadcaster RT was due to launch its French language news channel on Monday night amid heavy suspicion by the government and President Emmanuel Macron who has dubbed it ""an organ of propaganda"".Macron has led official criticism of RT, formerly known as ""Russia Today"", and openly accused it of sowing disinformation about him via its website and social media during the presidential election earlier this year which he won.RT has denied the allegations and RT France's chief executive Xenia Fedorova, speaking at the channel's new offices in a western Paris suburb, again brushed off criticism, saying that RT stood for news ""not covered by mainstream media"".The channel was being cold-shouldered by Macron and the channel had still not been granted accreditation to cover news conferences inside the French presidential Elysee palace, Fedorova said on Monday a few hours before the channel was due to start broadcasting.""There was just one example of when we actually managed to visit. That was actually during the Trump visit to Paris,"" she added, referring to the visit by the U.S. president last in July. A spokesman for the French government said last week that the current administration was concerned by encroachment on freedom of expression but highlighted that RT was owned by a foreign power. Fedorova brushed off the remarks, citing other well-known international news channels that receive public funding such as BBC World, France 24 or Al Jazeera. ""RT stands for news that are not covered by the mainstream media,"" she said. ""We will keep the platform (open) to perspectives and opinions that are either not covered or silenced.""CROWDED LANDSCAPE RT France has planned a budget of 20 million euros ($24 million) for its launch and aims to recruit a total of 150 people by the end next year. By comparison, BFM TV, France's number one news channel, started with 15 million euros and now has an annual budget of about 60 million euros. RT's first international channel was launched in December 2005. The network broadcasts in English, Arabic and Spanish and its programs are viewed by 70 million people in 38 countries, it says. The landscape for news channels is already crowded in France, with four round-the-clock local news channels.

63,"Dec 13, 2017 08:53AM ET","Exclusive: After Grenfell fire, same builders rehired to replace dangerous cladding, Reuters finds",nan,"By Tom BerginLONDON (Reuters) - Some building companies that installed dangerous cladding on social housing blocks across Britain are now winning new contracts following the Grenfell Tower blaze to remove their original work and install panels that can pass safety tests, a Reuters review shows.The safety of high-rise buildings has come under scrutiny since the Grenfell disaster in June which killed 71 people. The British government, which ordered a series of tests to establish which types of cladding panels met fire safety rules, said those on the London tower block did not comply.A Reuters review identified 65 other towers with cladding of a type that was approved by local building inspectors, but which government tests found did not comply with the statutory regulations. The towers were clad by major builders including French groups Engie (PA:ENGIE) and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), and Britain's  Galliford Try  (L:GFRD), Forrest, Wates Group, Rydon Group and Willmott Dixon. The Reuters review was based on publicly available building planning permission documents, which detail the work carried out and the materials used, as well as visits to the towers and statements from housing providers and builders. For 29 of the buildings, the same builders that installed the cladding have won new contracts to remove or replace the panels, according to the owners of the buildings, who said they were paying millions of pounds for the work. The rehired companies are Willmott Dixon, Wates and Engie. Willmott Dixon and Rydon said their cladding work complied with safety regulations, but did not say how. Wates, Bouygues, Galliford Try and Engie declined to answer questions on whether their work complied with regulations.""Following the Grenfell tragedy, we have been supporting the relevant councils, and removed the cladding where requested. Our primary concern is to ensure all residents in these buildings are secure and safe,"" said an Engie spokesman.In the wake of Grenfell, the government ordered an independent review into building regulations and fire safety, and the way the rules are complied with and enforced. The review is due to report its findings early next year. The 65 towers in question are owned by local governments - known as councils - or housing associations, which are publicly funded, non-profit bodies that provide housing intended for low-income people. At the time all the panels were installed, building inspectors - usually council workers but sometimes staff of inspection firms licensed by councils - signed off the work as being compliant with safety regulations, according to the owners of the blocks and the building firms involved. Chris Blythe, CEO of trade body the Chartered Institute of Building, said builders hired to carry out high-rise cladding projects used many subcontractors and advisers, and that this could lead to misunderstandings, with one party thinking another had ensured work was compliant. ""The business model we have is almost geared up for potential failure,"" said Blythe, adding that if fewer parties were involved, there would be less room for confusion over responsibilities.For all 65 blocks identified by Reuters, the councils or council-licensed firms whose inspectors approved the work as compliant either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment while the independent review was ongoing.The government has already acknowledged problems with the inspection process, with Fire Service Minister Nick Hurd saying in July there was a ""system failure, built up over many years"" in the area of regulation enforcement. However a spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), which ordered the cladding tests and regulations review, said sign-off by inspectors did not absolve contractors of responsibility to meet safety standards. FIRE TESTSCladding systems are panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency. Since 2006, building regulations have required materials used in cladding on high-rise buildings to be able to pass the ""BS 8414 test"" which measures combustibility.After Grenfell, the DCLG ordered a series BS 8414 tests to establish which types of cladding met fire safety rules. It said that, of around 600 social housing towers in England that had cladding, 161 had systems of a type that failed the tests. But it did not name the towers.Reuters identified 60 blocks which, since 2006, had been cladded with aluminum panels with polyethylene cores - a form of cladding that failed the DCLG's test, and which the prime minister and three other ministers have said breaches safety regulations when used in tall buildings. Five other blocks, also cladded since 2006, had combinations of panel and insulation board that failed the test. The three companies that were rehired to replace the cladding on 29 of the towers had all originally fitted aluminum panels with polyethylene cores. Wates secured contracts with Westminster council in central London and One Manchester housing association to reclad 14 towers it covered in 2007 and 2010. Willmott Dixon has received contracts from Oxford council and west London's Octavia housing association to replace panels it installed on three blocks early this year and in 2013.Engie has been hired by Barnet Homes in north London to replace cladding on three blocks it clad in 2012. It also has a contract to remove cladding from nine blocks in Salford, north England, owned by the local council that it clad around 2016. Engie has been hired to remove panels from 12 blocks it clad in 2012 and 2016, and install new cladding on three of them. The contracts are with housing associations Barnet Homes in north London, and Pendleton Together in Salford, north England. The three building companies declined to comment on how much the contracts were worth.However five of the six owners of the buildings told Reuters how much money they were paying for the work.Oxford council said about 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) for its two blocks; Octavia said about 2 million pounds for one block, Westminster council said about 6 million pounds for six blocks; and Barnet Homes said 8.2 million pounds for three blocks. Salford council said it expects to spend up to 25 million pounds in total for the removal and recladding work on nine blocks. Engie has been hired to remove its original panels, but the recladding contractor has not yet been named.One Manchester declined to comment on how much its recladding work would cost. The building companies declined to comment on the figures.LEGAL ACTIONJonathan Raynes a partner with law firm Steptoe & Johnson said councils or housing associations who paid contractors for cladding that turned out to be non-compliant could sue the contractor for the cost of replacing the cladding. ""The contract will almost certainly have a provision that says the contractor must build in accordance with statutory requirements,"" he said, adding that if the contract didn't say this, a requirement to act legally could be deemed implicit.Raynes and Adam Creasey, a solicitor with Lewis Nedas, said the fact building inspectors signed off on work did not remove the builder's responsibility to adhere to building regulations. Creasey added a builder could conceivably try and reclaim any money awarded against it from the body which provided the inspection sign-off. Reuters contacted the owners of all 65 blocks with cladding of a type that failed the government tests - seven local councils and 10 housing associations - and asked if they were considering legal action against contractors to recover the money spent on cladding, or to cover the cost of replacement.Only Camden council in north London said it was considering legal action. It declined to elaborate on its plans.Barnet said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Engie, over the original cladding but declined to say why. Westminster council said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Wates, because it believed the original work was compliant with the rules in place at the time. Oxford council said it had not sought money from Willmott Dixon over the original cladding and would only consider taking legal advice after the independent review was completed. One Manchester said it would not talk about seeking recompense while the review was on-going.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Swedish appliances maker Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) fell 2.9 percent despite saying it expected home appliances markets to grow in 2018.The results were overshadowed by industry data showing home appliance shipments in the United States, a major market for Electrolux, fell 1.3 percent year-on-year in October.Troubled British engineer GKN (L:GKN) sank 7.9 percent, the top faller after it announced a further write-off.Broker action was also a driver.

The launch is part of a push by the French firm to find alternative revenue streams and retain clients in the face of a price war in the telecommunications sector. It is also a test for the telecoms and banking industry, marking the first attempt in a major developed market by a telecoms company to launch a standalone bank. ""We are targeting 2 million clients in ten years. That would represent 25 percent of the (online banking) market, but I hope we will not stop there ... and we will be the market leader in several years,"" Andre Coisne, chief executive of Orange Bank, told Reuters in an interview.Coisne has previously launched online banks in France for ING Direct and Credit Agricole's BforBank.Orange is starting from a small base - Coisne says it has 25,000 customers have expressed interest ahead of the launch, a tiny fraction of the company's 21 million mobile clients. But the timing of its entry gives some room for optimism. In France, 793.4 million online banking e-payments were made last year according to the European Central Bank, up from 586.2 million in 2014. Consultancy Ernst & Young predicts the number of customers going online to open an account in France will surge nearly six-fold to 17 million in the next ten years. The regulatory environment is also becoming more favorable - next year new European Union rules will start to force banks to allow customer data to be made available to other companies, if the customers agree. That will help the likes of Orange to identify potential customers and offer them better deals than their current lenders. ""This is a good start,"" said Coisne, who will also face competition from telecoms rival Altice, which launches its bank in 2019. ORANGE IS THE NEW BANKOrange has beefed up financial services across its networks over the past ten years under several brands, such as Orange Money and Orange Cash, and Orange Finanse in Poland, which uses a platform created by Polish lender mBank.It targets 400 million euros in revenues for its financial services unit by 2018, out of which half would come from Africa.Africa is the world leader in mobile banking. Around 12 percent of adults there have a mobile money account against 2 percent globally, according to a 2014 World Bank survey.Telecoms operators have long hoped to repeat their banking success in Africa and other developing markets in advanced economies, but until now have only done so by relying on partnerships with existing banks, with little success. So far most telecoms operators have sought to retain customers by offering media content such as free access to music streaming apps like Spotify or movie streaming platform Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), as well as exclusive sports broadcasts.But a minority investor in Orange told Reuters that diversification through banking could prove smarter because these services are essential and sticky.""To me, it is smarter than spending millions on sport rights that expire every two or three years"", the investor said.There is no clearly successful precedent in major Western markets, which makes Orange's move so brave, said Tom Levine, global head of telecoms practice at Allen & Overy.""I hope their ambition goes beyond retaining customers through bundles because there is a real opportunity for telcos in banking to be a platform, thanks to the trust they inspire, their strong brand, and large customer base"".Orange is betting on a wide range of services - mobile, internet, TV, videos and music, and now banking - to help generate enough revenue to offset costs on infrastructure investments.""Our ambition is to offer everything, we are a complete bank,"" Coisne said.From Nov. 2, Orange customers can use an instant mobile payment service as well as a free debit card, current account and savings accounts. Its online app will also allow users to transfer money via text message to another Orange account, and use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android wallets.Other products, such as loans and insurance, are expected next year.BANKS COUNTER ATTACKOrange is not the only new entrant. Established banks such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are competing with new online low-cost banks such as N26, and retailers such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR).Some French banking executives have expressed concern about the entry of Orange Bank into the market and the impact on profit margins.Orange is ""potentially a very important competitor"", Philippe Brassac, chief executive of Credit Agricole, said in May.Banks are making investments to increase the appeal of their services to smartphone users, while also cutting branches to keep costs down.France's BNP Paribas upgraded its mobile app this year and hired a former marketing and digital executive at  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom to head its online Hello Bank! in France, while Credit Agricole is set to announce a new online banking offer in November.If Orange meets its target of 2 million customers in the next 6 to 10 years, it would likely be at the expense of these rival online businesses. But for Orange, banking would remain a small business relative to its overall size, says Bengt Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), CEO of telecoms consulting firm Northstream.""This would only bring a very small stream of additional revenue relative to the scale of Orange,"" he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

76,"Sep 27, 2017 11:45AM ET",France sees 2025 as new goal for ultra-fast broadband roll-out,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - France, which is at the bottom of EU rankings for ultra-fast fiber optic broadband coverage, sees 2025 as a new goal for rolling out the technology across the country, the head of France's digital agency told Reuters.President Emmanuel Macron, who wants to turn France into a ""start up nation"", has made universal access to fast broadband a key priority to stimulate the economy.In 2013, the former government announced a 20 billion-euro ($24 billion) plan to bring the high-speed broadband service to every household and business by 2022, using several different technologies (fiber optic, copper network, coaxial cable, wireless technology).Antoine Darodes, who heads France's digital agency said: ""After 2022, we'd have to finalize the roll out of FTTH (""fiber to the home"") throughout the whole country by 2025.""All decisions have not yet been made on this goal in terms of financing, he said in an interview.France currently ranks 24th among EU members in subscriptions to fast broadband, according to the European Commission.Telecoms operators and government bodies have raised questions in the past few months over the time frame and cost projections of the government's plans. France's public accounting office said in January the total sum needed to install the fast broadband network and connect all households and businesses would amount to 34.9 billion euros ($41 billion), which is 14.9 billion more than a first estimate in 2013. Altice's SFR Group, France's second biggest telecom operator after Orange, said in July it intended to roll out a fiber optic network across France on its own, breaking away from the government's initial plan that included 13-14 billion euros of investments by the state and local authorities to cover rural areas. ""Altice-SFR’s proposal solves two issues currently faced by the central and local governments: the delays caused by the complexity and lack of efficiency of the current schemes, and the sharp increase in public spending...,"" SFR in a statement in July.Darodes said the government welcomed SFR's position, provided that the company, founded by Franco-Israeli tycoon Patrick Drahi, did not call into question existing public investments and does not do ""cherry-picking"" if it invests in less populated areas. ""SFR can have its independent strategy,"" Darodes said. ""In my view, it's not achievable on the long term for the whole country,"" he said, adding that the government would be vigilant regarding the operator's commitments. ""We want to own our network because it better suits our cost model base as we use our own in-house technology,"" an SFR spokesman said, adding that announcements will be made on the company's roll-out plan and financing in future weeks. Separately, Darodes said talks were under way on mobile internet coverage between French telecoms regulator Arcep and the country's four telecom operators Orange, SFR, Iliad and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom.Arcep, which aims to improve mobile broadband coverage in less densely populated areas, said in July it intended to bring forward a review of obligations on frequency license holders to add new regulatory constraints on operators.The four operators, which rely on the permits to transport voice and data services, could see the related license auctions dropped and taxes lowered in exchange for higher coverage of the fourth generation of mobile internet, or 4G, in more sparsely inhabited rural areas, Darodes said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

85,"Jul 26, 2017 06:05AM ET",Another note of caution on European stocks as Credit Suisse says euro strength could bite,nan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's global strategists slightly rolled back their ""overweight"" stance on euro zone stocks on Wednesday as a surging euro and the potential for the brisk pace of inflows to ease forces a rethink on one of the year's most popular trades. Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is the latest big broker to sound a note of caution on European stocks. Europe remains an ""overweight"" at the firm and is their most preferred region globally after emerging markets.However, the euro's 10.5 percent rally this year has raised worries about the impact on profits for exporters, such as Europe's auto makers, who have long benefited from a weaker currency and account for a large portion of the region's profit pool.Those concerns come just as a brighter macroeconomic backdrop, easing political concerns and robust earnings have seen foreign investors, particularly from the U.S., return in numbers to European stocks and take valuations back above long-term averages.Credit Suisse estimated that a 10 percent rise in the euro would take around 6 percentage points off earnings growth. Economists at the firm see the euro rising to $1.22 against the dollar over the next year.Roughly half of continental European corporate profits are generated outside the euro zone, according to Credit Suisse, and the impact of the currency is an area of focus in the ongoing second-quarter earnings season. Credit Suisse pointed out that while Europe may be a consensus trade on a three or 12-month view, long-term investors are still skeptical as only 9 percent have chosen Europe as their ""top long"" on a five-year time horizon.The pan-European STOXX 600 index has gained around 6 percent so for this year, as has the blue chip euro zone-focused index, for which Credit Suisse cut its year-end target to 3,650 from 3,800.They also reduced their rating on French equities back to benchmark on concerns around euro strength, valuations and the economy, and also trimmed their ""overweight"" in Spanish equities.The broker remains ""underweight"" Italian stocks.Credit Suisse said it favored European stocks most geared to the domestic recovery and named ""outperform"" rated Deutsche Wohnen, Telenet, Aena, Cellnex,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Enel  (MI:ENEI),  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) among their picks.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The memorandum of understanding awarding Bouygues the contract was agreed in January 2016.The project was hindered by the company's struggle to get financial backing from international banks, which are still wary of U.S. sanctions over their activities in Iran, online newspaper La Lettre de l'Expansion earlier reported. ""The MoU is now void but there are still ongoing discussions with Iranian authorities,"" the Bouygues spokesman said. Aeroports de Paris (PA:ADP), initially Bouygues' partner for the Tehran airport terminal development, said in February it would no longer take part in the project.France's  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) also signed preliminary deals last January to build the extension of Iran's Mashhad and Isfahan airports, the country's second and fifth biggest hubs, and negotiations with Iranian authorities on those are still ongoing.Iran remains a major potential market for construction firms.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

103,"Jan 04, 2017 08:40AM ET",French road builder Colas banking on 2017 sales growth,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - French road builder  Colas  (PA:COLP) is eyeing higher sales this year as it could benefit from plans for more infrastructure spending in the United States, and in France ahead of local elections, its chief executive said on Wednesday.Herve Le Bouc told Reuters that Colas, a unit of French construction giant  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY), was keeping its 2016 forecast of lower sales and improved profitability.He was more bullish regarding 2017, saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"" in spite of uncertainties over issues such as Brexit and the new U.S. government that will be led by current President-elect Donald Trump.""There is good news: the U.S. and Canadian infrastructure spending plans and prospects of local elections in France in three years that are usually supportive for investments,"" he said.Colas, which makes 37 percent of Bouygues' revenue, had 2015 turnover of 12 billion euros ($12.5 billion), of which half came from France.In the United States, President-elect Trump is planning $1 trillion of infrastructure spending to boost the economy.It is too early to say if Trump will meet those promises but Colas can count on current plans, by the administration of outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama, to spend $550 billion over five years on infrastructure, said Le Bouc.""Colas' revenue in the United States could increase by some 4-5 percent each year over the next five years if the Obama plan materializes,"" he said.Colas, which makes 22 percent of its revenue in North America, saw sales in that region decline 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016.Sales also fell in France during those first nine months, but Le Bouc expected conditions to improve this year, with French municipalities likely to step up infrastructure spending ahead of local elections in 2020.Further support could come from the Canadian government, which is also seeking billions of infrastructure investments, and from increased British infrastructure spending to boost the UK economy after the Brexit vote to quit the European Union.Le Bouc also expressed optimism over Colas' plans for solar panels, with the company's Wattway unit currently testing solar panels that are embedded into roads and are capable of withstanding the weight of an 18-tonnes truck.These panels can then generate energy to power up streets, supermarkets or households without encroaching on farmland, and Colas is hoping to have some 50 testing sites by mid-2018 worldwide.Colas' share price gained little ground in 2016, rising 0.04 percent, while Bouygues' shares fell 7 percent in 2016."

120,"Aug 04, 2016 07:30AM ET",BlackRock's voting record clashes with CEO's tough talk on buybacks,nan,"By Ross KerberBOSTON (Reuters) - When Adam Kanzer wanted to stop the board of 3M Co (N:MMM) from including the lucrative impact of share buybacks in their chief executive's pay, he quoted Laurence Fink.Sitting atop the world's largest investment fund manager, BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), Fink is a vocal critic of companies’ excessive use of share buybacks. The practice is happening at a rapid clip among S&P 500 companies and according to critics is helping boost shareholder returns – and bosses’ pay – to the detriment of long-term growth.Kanzer, who is managing director of Domini Social Investments, channeled Fink at the top of his firm's resolution to the 3M (N:MMM) board, quoting his warning that large buybacks send ""a discouraging message about a company’s ability to use its resources wisely.""It didn't help. The resolution failed with 94 percent of shares cast voting against it. Shares held by BlackRock, 3M's third-largest investor with a 5.7 percent stake in the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape, according to its proxy, apparently were not supportive. Despite their CEO's strong views, funds run by BlackRock side with company management on questions tied to stock buybacks most of the time, according to filings analyzed by research firm Proxy Insight for Reuters.BlackRock is not alone. Large asset managers like Fidelity Investments and  State Street  Corp (N:STT) have a similar voting record on the matter, according to the analysis.But Fink's exhortations and BlackRock's size make its voting record stand out.In the last three years, Fink has made his concerns about buybacks a top theme of an annual letter to other CEOs stressing the importance of companies investing for the long term. His views have been carried widely in the financial press and echoed by U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.BlackRock's nearly $5 trillion in managed assets mean that it is often a top investor in many of the companies buying back their shares, giving it an outsize voice on whether that strategy is the right one.""Larry Fink’s letters demonstrate that leadership. We hope it's not all posturing,"" said Brandon Rees deputy director of the office of investment for the AFL-CIO, of Fink's efforts.The AFL-CIO is the largest federation of U.S. labor unions and sponsored a resolution at Illinois Tool Works (N:ITW) that, like Domini’s 3M resolution, called on the company to exclude the impact of share repurchases from executive pay calculations.The resolution failed, with 95 percent of votes cast against it. It is unclear if BlackRock, a top five investor in the equipment maker, voted for it. The company does not comment on how it votes or its engagement with individual companies, and public filings showing its votes are not yet available. Rees said while he admires Fink's sentiments, BlackRock does not release enough detail to fully evaluate whether BlackRock's engagement with particular companies has much impact.Fink, who was not made available to comment on this story, does not think all buybacks are bad. Some may be a prudent use of excess capital, and BlackRock itself has been buying roughly $275 million of its own shares every quarter, he has said.Spokesman Ed Sweeney said when BlackRock has concerns about a company's direction or corporate governance, it meets with directors and executives privately to ""catalyze positive changes,"" and votes against management when talks fail. He added that capital allocation matters like buybacks are just one of many areas it considers in its proxy voting process.In one case, BlackRock withheld support from two directors at ""a large oil and gas corporation"" this spring after the company -- which it declined to name -- did not make board members available to explain their strategy and capital allocation decisions, according to its website. It also did not support a member of Discovery Communications Inc's (O:DISCA) compensation committee last year after the company awarded its CEO the largest pay package in the S&P 500, according to securities filings.To guide those decisions, BlackRock turns to a team of 22 people who determine how to vote on thousands of ballot items each year at U.S. companies' annual meetings. Sweeney said that this division, headed by Michelle Edkins, is independent and votes in accordance with, ""our fiduciary duty to our clients."" BlackRock did not make Edkins available to comment.Matthew Weatherley-White, managing director of investment adviser Caprock Group, said BlackRock cannot vote too aggressively because many clients would not share Fink's views. For instance, choosing to buy back shares can boost shareholder returns in the short-term because it raises earnings per share.""Fink is sincere, but structurally they have a hard time following through,"" Weatherley-White said.THE POWER OF THE VOTES&P 500 firms are purchasing $445 billion in stock over the last 12 months of earnings reports, matching the previous year's peak. Add in dividends, and the total of $838 billion spent surpasses total capital expenditures of $707 billion in that time, according to a Reuters analysisMuch of BlackRock's nearly $5 trillion in managed assets is in passive investment products that buy and hold stocks only because they are in a particular index. That means that proxy votes are one of the few ways of expressing displeasure with a company. Actively managed funds can sell a company's stock anytime they become dissatisfied.""As an index fund owner, you have to own some really crummy companies"" that happen to be in an index, Fink said at an investor conference two years ago. The ""only power you have is your vote,"" he said.But BlackRock rarely exercised that power. In last year's proxy season, BlackRock funds opposed five percent of resolutions to approve share buybacks or repurchases, according to Proxy Insight's analysis for Reuters. To be sure, that was a stronger record than some rivals like Vanguard Group or T. Rowe Price (O:TROW), which opposed the resolutions one percent of the time and 2.7 percent of the time, respectively.Both T. Rowe Price and Vanguard declined to comment.BlackRock's Global Opportunities Fund , for instance, opposed management on just two of 85 resolutions in that period, including at construction firm  Bouygues  SA (PA:BOUY) and distiller  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP). BlackRock's Sweeney declined to discuss the votes, but proxy adviser Glass, Lewis had recommended against both measures on concerns they could be used to thwart takeover attempts.Filings analyzed by Proxy Insight for Reuters also show that of the 30 S&P 500 companies that bought back the highest proportion of their stock in 2014, funds run by BlackRock supported those companies' directors about 97 percent of the time the following year, the most recent period available. That is roughly as often as they supported S&P 500 directors overall.Public filings showing BlackRock's votes on specific directors and shareholder proposals this year are not yet available, including Kanzer's 3M resolution on buybacks.Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services did not support the change at 3M or at Illinois Tool, which is a blow since backing from ISS can add an extra 30 percentage points or so to the support level for a typical shareholder proposal, according to pay consulting firm Semler Brossy. But Kanzer was counting on Fink's BlackRock to back him up.""Considering the helpful things Larry Fink has been saying about excessive share buybacks, we had hoped to see BlackRock underscore that message through its proxy voting,"" said Kanzer of Domini Social Investments, an investment adviser that specializes in socially responsible investing and sponsored the 3M resolution.Kanzer noted that his resolution at least prompted 3M to offer more disclosure around its rationale for the buybacks, and said he had a ""productive conversation"" with 3M management. Will Domini re-submit similar resolutions at 3M and elsewhere next year?""Still thinking about it,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

122,"Jul 21, 2016 10:04AM ET",Indians help build Cuba hotels as foreign labor ban weakens,nan,"By Marc Frank(Reuters) - French construction group  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) is employing more than 100 Indian laborers to work on a hotel it is building in Cuba, breaking a taboo in the Communist-run country on hiring foreign labor in order to meet increased tourism demand.The Cuban government removed a key barrier to hiring foreign workers with the passage of a 2014 foreign investment law that authorized ""special regulations"" concerning foreign workers under ""exceptional circumstances.""Cuban government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the influx of foreign workers, several dozen of whom spoke to Reuters in Havana. But the Bouygues move, which was also confirmed by a company spokesman, is the first time a firm has bypassed Cuba's state-run labor halls to hire foreign workers en masse.For a country struggling to prop up export revenue in the face of low commodity prices, foreign workers on the Caribbean island signal how critical tourism is now in Cuba and how market forces are transforming its once tightly controlled economy.Already popular as a low-cost beach resort for Europeans and Canadians, Cuba is seeing a surge in American visitors since the United States and Cuba announced in December of 2014 that they would work to normalize relations.Tourism increased 17 percent in 2015 and was up over 11 percent through June this year, official data shows. It generated $2.8 billion in revenue last year.Meanwhile, the trade deficit in goods widened by $1.5 billion last year.At least three new hotels are under construction in Havana, the first new five-star hotels to be built there in a number of years. Another dozen under negotiation with potential investors, according to the Cuban tourism industry. One reason Bouygues is turning outside of Cuba for labor is because Cuban skilled tradesmen are opting to work in the private sector where they can earn much more than from the state.'LITTLE MOTIVATION' FOR CUBANSThe Indian tradesmen, who are being housed together east of the capital, are part of a much broader trend of such workers who emigrate to various work sites - especially in the Middle East - in search of higher wages than they can get in India. The practice, however, has not been widespread in Latin America or the Caribbean.Bouygues has already brought 200 Indian workers into Cuba and plans to bring more in the coming months, according to diplomats familiar with the situation and a Havana-based company employee who asked for anonymity due to restrictions on talking with the media.""It is true that the group is bringing in Indian workers trained in various parts of Bouygues ... throughout the world,"" a Paris-based spokesman for the company said.The Indians would be training local tradesmen in Cuba in addition to working directly on the projects themselves, he said.The laborers are working on two hotels in Havana and another at the Varadero tourism resort, the sources said. While Bouygues is co-managing the projects, foreign firms are required to partner with state-run construction companies that have strict limits on how much they can pay Cubans. They can pay foreign workers more, however.""The Cuban workers are not paid well so there is little motivation,"" a western diplomat familiar with the pay differential said, requesting anonymity due to diplomatic protocol. ""The Indian workers are being paid around 1,500 Euros a month, more than 10 times what their Cuban counterparts receive.""'WE LIKE SPICY FOOD'A few dozen of the skilled tradesmen, wearing orange jump suits, said they were happy to be in Cuba for at least a year.    The Indian workers were emerging for lunch from the Manzana de Gomez, an ornate building being converted into a luxury hotel in downtown Havana.    Inderjeet Singh Chopra, a bearded, slim electrician wearing a turban that is seldom seen in Havana, said there were more than one hundred of his countrymen working on the project as electricians, carpenters, plumbers and masons.    He did not mention training locals.    The Indian workers said they were paid according to their skills, but would not reveal how much.    ""To date their biggest complaint has been that they want some Indian food and a cook is on the way,"" the Bouygues source said.    Singh, who arrived two months ago, smiled when told the news.    “Yes, that has been a problem. We like spicy food,” he said."

124,"Jun 30, 2016 07:40AM ET",French telecoms watchdog to shine a light on poor Internet access,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS (Reuters) - French Internet users will get the information they need to choose the best telecoms provider under plans to make data on the quality of their services publicly available.The country's telecoms regulator hopes that the move, combined with new high-speed Internet capacity targets announced on Thursday, will improve connectivity for around 65 million people living in France, which lags its European peers.""For a long time our focus was to make sure French people benefit from attractive prices. Now that's done, the prices are good. Our priority now is to make sure our country is well-connected,"" Sebastien Soriano, head of regulator Arcep, told Reuters in an interview at his office in Paris.France ranked 16th among the 28 European Union (EU) member countries for growth in Internet connectivity over the past year and below the average growth rate, according to February figures from the European Commission.Soriano acknowledged the country still has a long way to go to improve. He calculates that France's high-speed mobile network needs up to 10,000 new antennas within three years, bringing the total to 75,000. By then, about 25,000 of these antennas should have shifted to high-speed ""4G"" technology.In fixed-line, about six million French households currently benefit from fixed high-speed services. The telecoms industry should add between 7 and 8 million households to that number within three years and about 80 percent of the total should be able to choose their operator. Official data put the number of French households at 28 million in 2012.The targets are not binding, but Soriano said he planned to open up access to operators' data showing which had the best-performing systems so that customers get visibility on which has the best network and where.Neither Soriano nor France's competition authority sets prices in France, but price competition has been fierce because anti-trust rules have made consolidation difficult.A recent attempt to ease the price war triggered by the arrival in 2012 of Iliad's Free Mobile low-cost services failed with the collapse three months ago of merger talks between France's number one telecoms operator Orange and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom."

136,"Apr 07, 2016 01:30AM ET",Mega deals morph into mega problems for Wall Street ,nan,"By Carl O'Donnell and Pamela BarbagliaNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - If 2015 was a dream year for Wall Street's top dealmakers, 2016 is starting to take a nightmarish turn.Some of the mega transactions that had champagne corks popping in boardrooms are running into antitrust problems and, in the case of pharmaceutical firm  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) $160 billion takeover of rival Allergan PLC (N:AGN), political opposition to a deal that envisaged the biggest drug company in the United States moving to Ireland to lower its taxes.The U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules this week that, while they did not name Pfizer and Allergan, had provisions that targeted a specific feature of their agreement and prompted both parties to walk away from what would have been the second-largest deal of all time.The move by the Obama administration to suddenly change the rules has sent a chilling message to dealmakers and comes on top of a number of legal challenges to big transactions such as Halliburton Co's (N:HAL) takeover of rival oil services company  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) on antitrust grounds.The political uncertainty and antitrust concerns mean that firms will think twice about future tie-ups that consolidate industries and move tax dollars offshore.""As uncertainty increases on multiple fronts, companies are markedly more cautious and the number of transformational deals worth $10 billion or more has significantly dropped this quarter compared to last year,"" said Luigi Rizzo, head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).The new U.S. rules do not directly affect most inversion deals, in which an American company buys a foreign counterpart and then moves abroad to lower its tax bill, but they have sent a message to company bosses about the risks of attempting to move their tax addresses overseas.Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), the U.S. exchange considering a bid for the  London Stock Exchange  Group PLC (L:LSE), has ruled out structuring any possible deal for the LSE as an inversion, despite it being possible to do so, according to people familiar with the internal deliberations, who declined to be identified.Intercontinental Exchange declined to comment.Tax inversions have been a political hot button issue in Washington for years.The rules unveiled this week were the Obama administration's third effort to stop U.S. companies renouncing their American citizenship but they are only a temporary stopgap.Formal legislation to overhaul U.S. tax rules would be needed to bring a permanent end to the practice.""We have succeeded in making it significantly harder for companies to strike inversion deals and redomicile overseas,"" said U.S. congressman Peter Welch. ""But we still need action in Congress.""With a U.S. presidential campaign looming later this year there is much uncertainty about what shape such legislation would take, making deals all the more difficult to strike. UNIQUE CHALLENGESLast year was a record for M&A and a bumper year for mega matches. Out of the $4.6 trillion in deals inked, the number of individual transactions that exceeded $30 billion in value was 18 compared with seven deals worth more than $30 billion in 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed.But the consequence of greater consolidation is increased scrutiny by antitrust officials. That was exemplified on Wednesday by the U.S. government filing a lawsuit to stop Halliburton from buying Baker Hughes, arguing the combination of the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies would lead to higher prices in the sector.The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop an unusually high number of deals in the past 18 months. FTC officials are in court this week to block a merger between  Staples Inc  (O:SPLS) and  Office Depot  Inc (O:ODP).""It isn't just the number of proposed deals that makes this a unique moment in antitrust enforcement; it's their size and their complexity,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a speech on Wednesday.""This represents a remarkable shift toward consolidation and it presents unique challenges to federal enforcers in our work to maintain markets that serve not just top executives and majority shareholders, but every American.""In Europe, meanwhile, talks between Orange SA (PA:ORAN) and  Bouygues  SA (PA:BOUY) to create a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed last week, amid competition concerns and a stand-off between Martin Bouygues and French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron about the clout the billionaire would have gained in the former state monopoly, according to people familiar with the matter.For bankers, scuttled deals cost money.Investment banks on the Pfizer and Allergan deal, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan, Centerview and Moelis, lost more than $200 million in fees when the companies walked, showed data from consultancy Freeman & Co.Faced with greater hurdles to get deals through, some investment bankers are rethinking how they want to structure their payoffs, including trying to get more cash upfront rather than a big check after a deal closes, said a person familiar with the matter.(Carl O'Donnell in NEW YORK and Pamela Barbaglia in LONDON; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis, John McCrank and Diane Bartz; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Christopher Cushing)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

140,"Apr 03, 2016 07:20PM ET",Suspicion and soured relationships sank Bouygues Telecom's deal,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Sophie SassardPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - When French Prime Minister Manuel Valls phoned billionaire Martin  Bouygues  on Thursday evening in an attempt to save a merger between Bouygues Telecom (PA:BOUY) and state-controlled Orange, it was already too late. The deal would have created the dominant player in an industry damaged by fierce competition, but collapsed on Friday morning with Bouygues deciding not to sell his telecoms business to the former state monopoly even though he had floated the idea himself four months earlier. The fact Bouygues had confirmed that the unprofitable telecom service provider he founded in 1994 was for sale made his rivals and Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron think the businessman had decided he had no choice but to sell, said four people involved in the talks who spoke to Reuters on Saturday and Sunday.""It's probably because of this first call that they all tried to rip him apart,"" one of the sources who is close to Orange (PA:ORAN) said, referring to the French government, which owns 23 percent of Orange, and rivals  Iliad  (PA:ILD) and SFR (PA:NUME).For the deal to go through, Iliad and SFR would have had to agree to buy some Bouygues Telecom assets to ease competition concerns. Spokespeople for the French Economy Ministry, Orange, Bouygues, SFR and Iliad declined to comment for this story. The weeks of deliberations were the best chance in years to take a contender out of the game and ease competitive pressures that had hammered profits in the industry and drained the capital needed for network investments to better serve an increasingly data-driven economy. The deal's collapse is a blow not just for the companies but for the French government.The perception among Martin Bouygues' rivals that they had the upper hand proved decisive on March 24 when a stand-off between the 63-year-old businessman and 38-year-old Macron came to a head and Bouygues stormed out of a meeting at the economy ministry, according to two of the sources.Bouygues felt humiliated by Macron's demands, said one of the sources, who is a banker. The scene highlighted the rocky relationship between France's Socialist government and Bouygues, who is godfather to a son of former right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy.CONTROL OF ORANGEThe complex telecoms merger, whose price tag Bouygues fixed at 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) in cash and Orange shares, would have made the conglomerate the second-biggest shareholder in Orange after the French state, which would have seen its stake diluted. For Macron, a former Rothschild & Cie banker, that raised questions about the role Bouygues would play in Orange which owns and manages submarine cables that are central to France's surveillance apparatus, making it a strategic asset for the government. Macron did not want to be perceived as having let Bouygues gain control. He wanted the government to keep three seats on the Orange board and a blocking minority at shareholder meetings, an idea that Bouygues understood and accepted from the start. But Bouygues was not happy with Macron's request to cap his potential stake in Orange for seven years and give up for 10 years the double-voting rights he was entitled to as a long-term investor in Orange, three of the sources said ""It's criminal to impose such conditions on Bouygues,"" the banker said. ""It's treating him like a second-class citizen. Any foreign raider who starts buying Orange shares would get better terms."" Macron and his advisers feared that Bouygues would use the same tactic as another French billionaire, Vincent Bollore, whose media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) quietly expanded its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) to eventually gain control. FRICTIONBouygues himself was not present at the discussions between Orange, Bouygues, Iliad and SFR at the Paris offices of his lawyer Jean-Michel Darrois where about 40 people gathered in the ten days preceding the collapse of the deal.All four companies wanted an agreement to end their price war. But the talks soured in the final week, according to several people present, with Bouygues increasingly mistrustful of the two other players Xavier Niel, the founder of Iliad, and the owner of SFR, Patrick Drahi. Bouygues became increasingly wary of the risks to his interests from the break-up of his telecom assets and the manner of their distribution among his rivals. Disagreements over break-up fees and the conditions under which each party involved would have been able to withdraw from the deal proved intractable, said several of the sources. ""Niel made concessions but only on the last day,"" said one of the sources who is close to Bouygues. ""He tried to obtain as much as he could.""($1 = 0.8782 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

141,"Apr 01, 2016 04:58PM ET",Orange and Bouygues $11.4 billion French telecoms deal collapses,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Sophie SassardPARIS (Reuters) - Talks between Orange (PA:ORAN) and  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) on a deal to create a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed on Friday, ending an attempt to ease a price war that has ravaged operators' margins.The failure of the proposed 10 billion euro ($11.4 billion) cash-and-share deal involving Bouygues Telecom is a blow to the two companies and the French government, which was heavily involved as it has a stake of around 23 percent in Orange.The proposed tie-up was widely seen as a make-or-break chance to reduce the number of telecoms groups to three from four and prop up profits, which have been depressed since the arrival of low-cost operator  Iliad .But a stand-off between Martin Bouygues and French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron about the clout the billionaire would have gained in the former state monopoly had weighed on the talks, sources had told Reuters earlier.""The two main reasons explaining the failure of these talks are execution risks and the general attitude of the French state,"" a source close to the matter told Reuters.The risks included the break-up fees involved and the conditions under which each party involved would have been able to withdraw from the deal, the source added. Orange's position as the No. 1 French telecoms operator meant that an acquisition of Bouygues Telecom would have required selling some of its assets to rivals Iliad (PA:ILD) and SFR (PA:NUME), with which Orange held parallel negotiations.This added to the complexity of getting a deal done, sources said, as apart from Bouygues himself, the talks involved two other influential billionaires, Iliad's founder Xavier Niel and SFR's owner Patrick Drahi.""It would have been a miracle if they had come to terms,"" a source close to the matter said. GOING IT ALONEThe failure to reach a deal, which was confirmed by both parties, leaves Bouygues Telecom to go it alone.""In a market where the possibility of consolidation is now ruled out for the long term, Bouygues Telecom will continue its standalone strategy,"" Bouygues, the construction-to-media conglomerate said in a statement.That could prove difficult for them, Francois Mallet, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said.""They will all be kicking themselves,"" Mallet said on BFM Business, adding: ""The state has a big responsibility in this. The big loser is Bouygues, let's not kid ourselves.""A source at the French Economy Ministry said that the main hurdle had been the risks involved in getting a deal across the line, with competition concerns a factor.""It was an extremely complex deal and there was the question of the competition authority hanging,"" the source told Reuters.The tie-up would have made Bouygues the second-biggest shareholder of Orange after the French state, whose stake would have been diluted.The French Economy Ministry had asked Bouygues to accept capping its potential stake in Orange for seven years, under a so-called standstill clause.It had also asked it to accept giving up for 10 years the double-voting rights Bouygues would get as a long-term investor in Orange, another source said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

147,"Feb 24, 2016 12:50PM ET",The great European telecoms M&A scramble is losing momentum,nan,"By Mathieu RosemainBARCELONA (Reuters) - The merger and acquisition activity that has characterized the European telecoms market in recent years could soon grind to a halt, even as Orange (PA:ORAN) looks to seal a potential 10 billion euro ($11 billion) deal for French rival  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY).While Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard believes that the so-called convergence of fixed networks and mobile services remains key to growth, sector analysts have noted regulators' growing concern about reduced competition while the differences between individual markets mean that cross-border integration could prove unworkable.""The players that are mobile only or fixed only will have difficulties if they want to remain competitive in Europe,"" Orange CEO Richard said at the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. ""We're having this kind of discussion about consolidation in Europe because we're having a convergence issue.""That desire to broaden the appeal to customers wanting a single operator for multiple services was highlighted by the announcement last week of a tie-up between mobile telecoms network operator  Vodafone  (L:VOD) and cable company Liberty Global (O:LBTYA). The two companies are looking to combine their Dutch operations to create a stronger package of TV, broadband Internet and mobile.Similarly, Britain's BT Group (L:BT) bought EE from Orange and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) for 12.5 billion pounds ($17.4 billion) to create a single integrated network offering a combination of telecoms and TV services.TWITCHY WATCHDOGSHowever, competition authorities are becoming increasingly twitchy about the shrinking number of operators in some countries.The proposed takeover of Telefonica's (MC:TEF) O2 by CK Hutchison Holdings (HK:0001) in Britain received a less than glowing response from the head of British telecoms regulator Ofcom, Sharon White, who spoke of potential risks to investment and prices in a Financial Times article this month.Hutchison also received a list of objections this month from EU's antitrust authorities over a deal that would create Britain's biggest mobile operator, a person familiar with the matter said.EU authorities are anxious to avoid a repeat of the situation that followed the 1.3 billion euro acquisition of Orange Austria by Hutchison in 2013. That deal led to price increases of more than 30 percent for mobile users, Austria's telecoms regulator said.The hardened attitude of competition watchdogs was emphasized in September, when a proposed merger of  Telenor  (OL:TEL) and TeliaSonera (ST:TLSN) in Denmark was withdrawn after EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager expressed concerns it would lead to higher prices for consumers, marking the first time such a deal had been blocked since telecoms companies began their M&A spree three years ago.One might think that these obstacles to domestic deals would raise the prospect of pan-European consolidation among the region's 30-plus operators, but the risks and complexity make such mega-mergers unlikely.VALUATION PEAK?""We're not the United States of Europe. There are very few synergies between countries as of today,"" says  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Agathe Martin.""Content (services) are specific to each country and social stakes create difficulties, not to mention the different regulatory frameworks.""One of the upshots for European telecoms companies is a potential drop in share price valuations.""It's not the right time to buy telecoms shares,"" Natixis analyst Jacques de Greling said.""We're reaching a valuation peak that is essentially due to the M&A activity in the domestic markets. It will soon be over as there won't be anything else to consolidate after the number of operators is cut to three in each market and given that there's no cable operator to buy.""De Greling estimates that the relative price-to-earnings ratio for the European telecoms sector is at about 1.3, compared with the historic average of 0.9 for the overall market.Yet M&A is far from an exact science and a big acquisition is not totally beyond the realms of possibility.“Would I rule out that somebody does something completely stupid? No,"" said Wolfgang Bock, leader of the telecommunications practice at Boston Consulting Group. ""You can always find big egos who ignore the economic realities to build an empire. Empire-builders might come back at some point.”($1 = 0.9112 euros)($1 = 0.7200 pounds)(Corrects typographical error in first paragraph, clarifies eighth paragraph to show deal would create biggest mobile operator)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Construction group  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) and airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) are set to build an extension for Tehran airport, while  Vinci  (PA:SGEF), another building firm, is lined up to design, build and operate new terminals for the Mashhad and Ispahan airports.French oil company Total said it would buy some 200,000 barrels of Iranian crude from the OPEC producer. There were also deals in shipping, health, agriculture and water provision, all signed despite continued diplomatic tensions.DEALS UNFINISHED, BANKS WARYThe Airbus deal alone is worth $27 billion at list prices and French government sources put a 15 billion euro ($16 billion) overall tag on the agreements.But most have yet to be finalised or are subject to conditions. Senior French bankers have expressed wariness.Iran's industry minister Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said an agreement between French export-credit group  Coface  (PA:COFA) and the Iranian central bank signed this week was an important step in the right direction.But he said French banks must support a corporate push into post-sanctions Iran. ""If they don't get active, there will be no increase in business,"" he warned. For Peugeot, the Iranian factory tie up is critical. When it suspended sales in Iran in 2012 it lost nearly 10 percent of global deliveries and interrupted a relationship dating back more than 50 years.Under Thursday's deal, set to be finalised in the middle of this year, Peugeot and Iran Khodro plan to modernize a factory near Tehran and be producing cars by mid 2017.They target an initial 200,000 vehicles a year making Peugeot 208, 2008 and 301 models with a Peugeot investment of 400 million euros ($436 million) over five years.Away from the signing ceremonies and speeches, an estimated 3,000 people marched through Paris seeking to raise awareness about human rights. A protestor from the Femen womens' activist group dangled in a mock hanging from a bridge with an Iranian flag painted across her naked chest.Human Rights Watch criticized Iran on the death penalty and abuse of rights of women and minorities.

Officials have said certain ""commitments"" could now be agreed, although how definitive they are is unclear.""We don't see any obstacles for companies who would want to come and invest in Iran,"" Rouhani told a French business delegation. ""My coming here is to show that Iran is ready for investments,"" he added, speaking through a translator.Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier, who was part of the French delegation, said that he held talks this month in Tehran with government and Iran Air officials that could lead to the rapid sale of aircraft.""We are at the disposal of our Iranian counterparts to help renew the fleet,"" Bregier said. Iran urgently needs modern, safer and less-polluting airliners after decades of being unable to obtain spare parts or new models due to sanctions.After starting his trip to Paris by meeting some 20 company executives, Rouhani is due to deliver a speech to business leaders on Thursday at a Franco-Iranian forum, where Iranian ministers will outline their plans.Several agreements are due to be announced after a meeting with President Francois Hollande.Iranian officials have said they are poised to agree on a deal for Airbus aircraft. Carmakers Peugeot and  Renault  (PA:RENA) may also agree contracts.Airport design and construction talks may be on the agenda too, potentially involving builders  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) and Vinci and airports operator ADP.Although many sanctions relating to Iran's nuclear program have been lifted, most U.S. measures remain in place. Companies are worried about the sanctions snapping back if Iran violated the terms of the nuclear agreement and are including this scenario in their risk analysis.""Investing in Iran is not exactly like investing in Holland or Denmark,"" a French diplomatic source said.

152,"Jan 12, 2016 06:10AM ET",Orange CEO says Bouygues merger would have to create value,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Bate FelixPARIS (Reuters) - Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard said on Tuesday that a merger with rival French telecoms operator  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) would have to create value for the company and safeguard jobs in the sector.Orange is in talks to buy Bouygues Telecom for about 10 billion euros ($10.9 bln) in cash and shares, in a deal which could see Bouygues receive a 15 percent stake in Orange valued at 8 billion euros, and the rest in cash.The tie-up would reduce the number of mobile operators in France from four to three, creating a new giant with a market share of close to 50 percent in mobile and fixed-line communications.""The merger must create value for Orange and boost investments in the French telecoms sector,"" Richard told journalists at a news conference in Paris, adding the negotiations were started by Bouygues's billionaire CEO Martin Bouygues.""I will not engage Orange in a risky deal,"" Richard said, adding that he did not expect a protracted negotiation lasting months but saw it concluding within weeks.Richard said the potential deal would not have any negative impact on consumers.He said the tie-up and consolidation in the French telecoms market was needed to stimulate investments in infrastructure and also enable French telecoms firms to compete with European peers.He added that the negotiations did not involve any talks over Bouygues' TF1 television channel.Richard said that whatever the outcome of the merger talks, the French state will remain the leading shareholder in Orange.The most contentious issues in the negotiations are over jobs, investments in infrastructure and especially fiber optic networks, and antitrust-related disposals, a source familiar with the matter had told Reuters.Richard said he expected the deal to be screened by France's competition authorities rather than the European Commission.A deal would mean a return to three mobile operators in France four years after the arrival of Iliad's Free Mobile low-cost services led to a protracted price war.Competition concerns over a tie-up between Orange and Bouygues could, however, allow Numericable-SFR and France's fourth-biggest mobile network operator, Iliad, to scoop up assets if disposals are required.Mobile telecom operator Coriolis said on Monday it was interested in taking over the business telecommunications arm of Bouygues Telecom, Les Echos newspaper reported.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

157,"Oct 06, 2015 04:09AM ET","Bouygues Telecom eyes higher profitability, sales",nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) -  Bouygues  (PARIS:BOUY) Telecom, France's third-largest mobile operator, said on Tuesday it aimed to improve its profit margins and sales in the coming years as it seeks to defend its standalone strategy.In June, Martin Bouygues, the head of parent company Bouygues, rebuffed a 10 billion euro ($11 billion) bid for Bouygues Telecom by Altice, the holding company of tycoon Patrick Drahi, saying the unit had the means to prosper on its own.Bouygues Telecom notably believes that the quality and strength of its mobile network will help it benefit from a new period of growth in the telecoms market, as subscribers increasingly watch videos and play games on their mobile devices.When it rebuffed Drahi's offer, Bouygues had said the telecoms unit aimed to return to an 2011 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin of at least 25 percent of sales by 2017 against 17.98 percent in 2014.This would be achieved notably by cutting costs and increasing its fixed and mobile subscriber base by 1 million each by 2017.Bouygues Telecom reiterated these targets in a statement released ahead of its Capital Markets Day on Tuesday, and set a new EBITDA margin target of 35 percent longer-term.Bouygues Telecom, which has been hit by a price war in the French telecoms market since the arrival of Iliad in 2012, has responded with a turnaround plan including staff cuts and a focus on the rollout of its very-high speed 4G network and on the fixed broadband market.Bouygues Telecom said on Tuesday it would exceed by 100 million euros its target for 300 million euros of cost savings in 2016 versus the end of 2013.It also said it aimed to grow network sales by more than 10 percent by 2017 from 3.869 billion euros in 2014 and that it targeted average annual capital expenditures of around 750 million euros in the coming years.($1 = 0.8942 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

158,"Sep 29, 2015 12:18PM ET",All four French telecoms groups submit applications for mobile auction,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's telecoms regulator ARCEP said on Tuesday that it has received applications from all four domestic carriers to indicate that they will take part in an upcoming auction of 4G mobile spectrum.Orange, Numericable-SFR,  Bouygues  (PARIS:BOUY) Telecom and Iliad will bid for the 700 megahertz airwaves, which are being freed up from television broadcasters. Mobile carriers need such low-frequency spectrum to transport voice and data traffic at time when volumes are surging as people increasingly surf the web and watch video on the go.The auction process will occur during the month of November, said ARCEP, with the aim of delivering the approvals by end of the year. France hopes to raise at least 2.5 billion euros from the sale of mobile airwaves, which has already been earmarked for the defense budget.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""We will continue our investments. However, I do not believe that winning back customers requires lowering prices,"" Combes was quoted as saying. Low-cost telecoms group Iliad has shaken up France's mobile market in 2012 with cheap, no-contract plans, putting pressure on established players Orange, Numericable-SFR and  Bouygues  (PARIS:BOUY) Telecom. In the first half of the year, Iliad's Free Mobile increased its market share by one percentage point to 16 percent. Combes said SFR had long been known as the most innovative company in the industry and that it would regain that position. Asked whether Altice would continue its acquisition drive, Combes said his priority was to consolidate the firm's current assets. ""We need to continue to structure and industrialise the operation of the group,"" he said. Altice, controlled by billionaire Patrick Drahi, has been on a buying spree, including the purchase of Vivendi's SFR, the second-biggest French mobile firm, to create Numericable-SFR. Drahi also made a bid for Bouygues Telecom, which was rejected.Combes, 53, is leaving his role as head of telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (PARIS:ALUA) ahead of its takeover by Finland's Nokia (HEL:NOKIA) Corp.Combes, who joined  Alcatel  from  Vodafone  (LONDON:VOD) in 2013, has more than 25 years of experience in the telecoms industry and has a record as a cost-cutter.But he has come under fire over the payout he is set to receive after leaving Alcatel-Lucent.

The current deal has the backing of the French state, which will buy up to 20 percent of  Alstom  from construction group  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) once the GE bid is cleared.The U.S. conglomerate, which offered concessions to head off the Commission's worries about the deal a month ago, improved its package last week.""GE is likely to get approval,"" one of the sources said.The second source said GE had originally offered to divest some manufacturing and services activities and research and development units around the world, including a facility in Switzerland and Alstom's Power Systems Manufacturing operation.It was not clear what changes GE had made to improve its offer.GE shares doubled their gains after the Reuters story and were trading 1 percent up at $26 at 1757 GMT.The people said Italian company Ansaldo Energia, which is 40 percent owned by Italian state-backed investment fund Fondo Strategico Italiano and another 40 percent by China's Shanghai Electric (SS:601727), was seen as the preferred buyer for the assets.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Alstom declined to comment. The Commission has set a Sept. 11 deadline for its decision.GE spokesman Jim Healy said: ""We submitted a remedy package that addresses the Commission's concerns and preserves the economic rationale of the deal.""The EU antitrust authority in June warned of the reduced competition in Europe resulting from the deal as GE's only rival would be Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), with Ansaldo seen as a niche player. A third global rival would be Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

180,"Jun 23, 2015 05:08PM ET",Bouygues shuns Altice's bid for telecom arm,nan,"By Leila Abboud and Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French conglomerate  Bouygues  (PARIS:BOUY) on Tuesday snubbed an offer for its telecom unit from larger rival Altice that sources put at 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion), citing execution risks and confidence it could prosper on its own.The board believes Bouygues Telecom is well placed to benefit from a new period of growth in the telecoms market, underpinned by digital usage, Bouygues said in a statement.It added that the offer presents a ""significant execution risk, which should not be borne by Bouygues, particularly in terms of competition law in both the fixed and mobile markets"".The move comes as a blow to Patrick Drahi, the billionaire backer of Altice, owner of mobile operator Numericable-SFR, who has bought four companies in the past 18 months.Altice could not be immediately reached for comment.If successful the deal would have combined the current No. 2 and No. 3 mobile operators to create France's biggest telecoms group and taken the French mobile market from four to three players at a time when the merits of such consolidation are being hotly debated in Europe.The board's decision also follows opposition from President Francois Hollande's Socialist government who had expressed concern over the deal, saying it could be bad for jobs, consumers and investment.Bouygues's board said it paid ""great attention"" to the social consequences of the deal. Martin Bouygues, scion of one of France's top industrialist families, decided against parting with the telecoms business that is his main contribution to the conglomerate built by his father.The 63-year-old Bouygues has already rebuffed at least two offers in the past year for the unit he founded in 1994, insisting as recently as last month that Bouygues Telecom could prosper on its own. He once replied to a question about selling the business: ""And you, would you sell your wife?""But the offer by Drahi outstripped past approaches. Drahi's own empire-building took off in 2014 when he beat out Bouygues to acquire Vivendi's SFR, the second-biggest mobile operator.The 10 billion-euro price tag would have valued the unit as much as the entire Bouygues group before the offer was made public. It also eclipsed earlier offers from Orange and low-cost operator Iliad - each around 5.5 billion euros - as well as a previous 8 billion-euro approach by Drahi.The business, which has been posting losses since Iliad broke into the French mobile market three years ago, had a 2014 total asset value of 5.8 billion euros.The board said Bouygues Telecom had the means to return to a 2011 EBITDA margin of at least 25 percent by 2017.POLITICAL CONCERNDrahi, known for aggressive cost-cutting, could have extracted as much as 1 billion euros a year in synergies to raise profit margins, analysts estimated, but only at the expense of painful job cuts - which Bouygues had indicated he wanted to avoid.The French government was also worried over an upcoming auction of radio spectrum for 4G mobile broadband networks from which the state wants to raise 2.5 billion euros.""The offer does not factor in the imminent launch of the 700 MHz frequencies auction process and its consequences on the deal,"" Bouygues said.Set against obstacles to the deal was the increasingly cut-throat nature of the French telecoms sector and how Bouygues Telecom, after a strong start, has struggled to keep up since Iliad's 2012 arrival as a fourth national player.Bouygues shares closed down 0.13 percent, having jumped 13 percent on Monday on hopes of a deal. They were likely to fall sharply on Wednesday in reaction to the decision, analysts said.Similar pain could hit the other French telecom operators, which had added more than 10 billion euros in market value in recent days, as observers bet that mobile consolidation would end a three-year-old price war.For its part, market leader Orange said that it accepted Bouygues' decision with ""serenity"" since it had the skills and size to succeed despite tough competition. ""Nevertheless we are convinced that in the long-term the French telecoms market cannot support four network operators,"" a company spokesman said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

186,"Jun 22, 2015 11:05AM ET",Altice offer for Bouygues Telecom lifts French sector shares,nan,"By Leila AbboudPARIS (Reuters) - European cable and telecoms group Altice (AS:ATCE) has made an offer to buy France's  Bouygues  Telecom through its subsidiary Numericable-SFR (PA:NUME), the companies said on Monday, sending share prices up across the French telecoms sector.Bouygues Telecom's parent Bouygues SA (PA:BOUY) said its board would meet on Tuesday to discuss what it called Altice's ""unsolicited offer"", adding that no negotiations between the two sides were underway. ""Altice will update the market in due course,"" it said.Neither party disclosed the value of the offer, but sources told Reuters at the weekend that Patrick Drahi, the controlling shareholder in Altice, had submitted a bid in recent weeks worth around 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) in cash.Investors cheered the prospect of a merger that would generate big cost savings and potentially calm a brutal price war that has raged in France since 2012 when low-cost operator  Iliad  (PA:ILD) entered the mobile market.Drahi is set to discuss the matter on Tuesday with French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron, according to a person familiar with the matter. The government is concerned that the focus on such deals could slow investment in mobile and high-speed broadband and that developments could upset the smooth running of an upcoming auction of air waves for mobile networks, the person said.Shares in Altice and Numericable-SFR were up 14 percent and 14.5 percent respectively by 1424 GMT, while Bouygues was up 13.6 percent. Shares in French market leader Orange (PA:ORAN) rose 7.5 percent, while Iliad (PA:ILD) gained nearly 12 percent.Analysts value Bouygues Telecom at between 5 and 6.5 billion euros, making a 10 billion-euro bid appear generous for a company that has been posting losses since Iliad's assault on the mobile market.The offer is also higher than previous bids made for Bouygues Telecom, including a joint one last year from Orange and Iliad which was valued at around 5 billion euros and one from Numericable earlier this year worth 8 billion euros.The entire market value of the Bouygues (PA:BOUY) conglomerate, which includes businesses in roads, construction and television, as well as telecoms, stood at 11.3 billion euros before the latest offer was made public. If completed, the deal would put Numericable-SFR ahead of state-backed Orange in terms of subscribers, and cut from four to three the number of competing network operators in Europe's third-largest telecoms market.Buying Bouygues would allow Numericable-SFR to reap massive cost savings by cutting staff and rationalizing stores, among other measures. Berenberg analysts put the savings at 850 million euros per year.Two sources familiar with the matter said Drahi has already secured financing with banks  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) and JP Morgan.POLITICAL ISSUESBut it remains to be seen if a deal will get done, especially since the billionaire founder of Bouygues Telecom, Martin Bouygues, has said repeatedly in recent months that he does not want to sell.There are also political issues for Drahi and Altice to overcome as the French government has already signaled its opposition due to concerns for jobs and spending on infrastructure.The state is preparing to auction off more radio frequencies for use by 4G mobile broadband networks this summer and the government is counting on raising at least 2.5 billion euros that has already been earmarked for the military budget.If Numericable-SFR buys Bouygues, there would be one fewer bidder competing for the low-frequency 700 megahertz band of frequencies on offer, potentially lowering the proceeds for the state.In a separate statement, Numericable-SFR and Iliad confirmed they were in exclusive talks over selling a portfolio of Bouygues assets to Iliad if the first deal goes through. In an effort to allay competition concerns, Iliad would take over many of Bouygues Telecom's mobile masts and radio spectrum, two sources said on Sunday. The companies did not say anything about how Bouygues' network assets would be valued.Such an arrangement would be a massive boost for Iliad, which has been rushing to expand its own mobile network and owns far less mobile spectrum than its three larger competitors. France's antitrust authority declined to comment on the proposed takeover.Stephane Beyazian, analyst at Raymond James, put the chances of success for the Altice deal to buy Bouygues Telecom at 50 or 60 percent due to ""antitrust risk"".""Bouygues' board will likely accept the offer, in our view, assuming there is a material cash proportion,"" said Beyazian.""We also believe that the board will need to consider that they may not achieve a better value for this asset, even assuming that the ongoing restructuring plan is successful.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

188,"Jun 08, 2015 09:15AM ET","Cuba Inc. open to foreign capitalists, but within limits",nan,"By Daniel Trotta and Marc FrankHAVANA (Reuters) - Communist Cuba's newfound interest in foreign capital has its limits, as Philippe Pouletty found out.A French doctor, venture capitalist and founder of biotech company Abivax, Pouletty is working with Cuba's Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology to develop a therapeutic vaccine to treat chronic Hepatitis B that could be on the Asian market in two years and in Europe after that.But when he pitched the idea of floating a company on the pan-European stock market Euronext with the Cuban state as a shareholder, that was clearly too much, too soon.""I told him in a half serious, half joking mode, that I had a capitalist proposal,"" Pouletty said of his conversation with Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro's eldest son, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, a science advisor to the government.""His response after more than 30 seconds was 'That's indeed very intriguing, but if you want us to reach an agreement quickly, that's not the fastest route. It's a few years too soon.'""Instead, Abivax agreed to buy vaccines at a predetermined price and pay royalties to Cuba when the product is on the market.Pouletty's story offers a peek into the mindset of Cuba Inc.Convinced their country needs capital, Cuba's leaders are welcoming businesses under a foreign investment law passed a year ago, but they want tight control over the pace of change. U.S. business interest in Cuba has exploded since December, when President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced they would restore diplomatic relations after decades of hostility.""In the morning on Dec. 17, Cuba was still a word spoken in U.S. business circles with hushed tones. By the afternoon, half of corporate America was rambling around forming a Cuba team,"" said Mark Entwistle, a former Canadian ambassador to Cuba and now a partner at Toronto-based merchant bank Acasta Capital who advises companies interested in Cuba.Among those joining a recent New York state delegation to Cuba were executives from JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU),  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and MasterCard Inc (N:MA).Most U.S. companies are still blocked by the 53-year-old trade embargo, although Obama has relaxed it for some imports, travel and telecommunications. That has allowed for minor deals such as Netflix (O:NFLX) streaming movies in Cuba and Airbnb listing Cuban rental properties online.If Obama can convince Congress to end the embargo, U.S. firms would be free to do business here, though they would still face major obstacles, including a multi-layered bureaucracy, an unpredictable legal system and highly regimented labor market. Many foreign companies have thrived over the years. They run hotels, build ships, refine oil and pack meat. Some have a share in bottled water, beer, soda, rum and cigar businesses.Canada's Sherritt International (TO:S) is perhaps the most vested. It has been here since 1992 and generated 73 percent of its C$1.136 billion revenues in 2014 from Cuba-related businesses. Sherritt mines nickel in Cuba and refines it in Canada in a 50-50 joint venture with Cuba's government. It also produces 20,000 barrels per day of oil that it sells to Cuba and has a one-third interest in an electricity joint venture.Even in a business subject to price swings, Sherritt says it has always made a profit or at least broken even with Cuban nickel.""We would tell others that Cuba's a great place to do business,"" said Sean McCaughan, vice-president for investor relations, even though the embargo means top Sherritt executives are banned from setting foot in the United States and the company is cut off from U.S. capital markets or shipping through U.S. territory.Other companies have failed miserably in Cuba and were forced to leave or had their executives imprisoned and their assets confiscated. Petty bribery can land people in jail.And at least one billionaire real estate mogul came away from a recent trip to Cuba unimpressed.""I didn't find there were lot of great opportunities. It was like going back in time,"" Stephen Ross, chairman and founder of The Related Companies, told CNBC television. ""You need a government that really wants change, that really wants business, and really wants to see growth, and you don't really have any of that feeling at all.""LISTEN AND ADAPTThose who have been successful have simple advice: be flexible and listen to Cuban officials, because they will tell you exactly what they want. ""There are foreigners who come here with an attitude of superiority. In other words, 'We're going to show the Cubans.' In general, those are the ones who fail spectacularly,"" said Alexandre Carpenter, co-president of cigarette-maker Brascuba, a joint venture between Cuba and the Brazilian subsidiary of  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS).There is no escaping the state's central planning. Foreign firms in joint ventures must order raw materials a year ahead of time. Property is leased from the state, it is not up for sale.Cuba regularly draws up a portfolio of projects it wants foreigners to help with. The latest one, issued in November, outlines 246, most of them joint ventures, that need investments totaling $8.7 billion. In one of the most attractive sectors, tourism, the portfolio lists five hotel construction projects; two golf resort developments; and contracts to manage 33 existing hotels.But the government rarely tries to force its Marxist ideology on foreign partners as long as Cubans do not get rich.""To the contrary. They demand that the business grow and generate more profits every year,"" Carpenter said.One of the largest foreign firms in Cuba is Brazil's Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], which built a $900 million port at Mariel, the centerpiece of an economic development zone designed to attract capitalist ventures with a more liberal import-export regime.Odebrecht wants to build a plastics factory there and it also has deals to expand Havana's international airport, operate a sugar refinery, and build two hotels.Mauro Hueb, head of Odebrecht's operations here, says the advantages of operating in Cuba include an educated, low-cost workforce and low logistical costs, and that to take advantage a company needs to learn and respect local customs.""You have to have the capacity to adapt,"" said Hueb. ""Here in Cuba, we consider ourselves a Cuban company.""Other successful ventures, some with U.S. stockholders, include Sherritt and French builder  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY). Swiss conglomerate Nestle (VX:NESN) has a bottled water and soft drinks business. Spanish hoteliers Melia Hotels International (MC:MEL), Iberostar and NH (MC:NHH) have established footholds in tourism and global beer giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) brews Cuban suds.SOVIET COLLAPSECuba's communist government first opened to international firms in the 1990s amid economic crisis caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main ally and benefactor.Results have been mixed. Cuba says around 60 percent of foreign investment projects begun since the 1990s have had to close. Sometimes it kicks foreign partners out, saying they failed to live up to their side of the deal. Sometimes the companies leave on their own. The corporate landscape is still sparse, with only around 100 direct investment projects and a similar number of deals in which foreigners manage a Cuban company without an equity stake.While U.S. firms hope the normalization of relations and economic reforms under way in Cuba will improve the investment climate, experts say change will be gradual. For years, foreigners' biggest complaints have been the lack of control over labor, the uncertain legal environment, and the multiple layers of bureaucracy to get a project approved.""Forget owning a piece of the rock. The most you can hope for is a 50-50 venture with a state-run partner,"" a European economic attaché said. ""And that will be the exception. The rule remains a minority interest.""British-Dutch consumer goods giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) became the first major corporation to enter Cuba after the fall of Soviet communism.Desperate for hard currency and consumer products, Cuba agreed to a 50-50 venture on a factory complex but when the 15-year deal came up for renewal it insisted on majority ownership. Unilever left the country although it is now in discussions on returning, several sources familiar with the talks said.When business goes wrong, it can be dire.An extreme example is that of Canadian businessman Cy Tokmakjian, who served three years in jail for bribery and other charges before being freed in February.Tokmakjian had done business in Cuba for 20 years, then suddenly was arrested in 2011 and his company shuttered as prosecutors accused him of wooing officials and their families with gifts. His company called it a ""travesty of justice"".Stephen Purvis, the former development director of British investment fund Coral Capital who built hotels and planned a golf course in Cuba, was arrested in 2011 in a crackdown on corruption.Purvis said he was falsely accused by a rival, interrogated for five days, and denied a lawyer for a month. He was eventually deported after being convicted on a minor charge. ""There is a virtual 100 percent conviction rate,"" Purvis said. ""Once detained you will be charged and found guilty. It's just a question of what for.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

193,"May 19, 2015 08:54PM ET","Exclusive: Altice eyes U.S. with TWC, Suddenlink buys - sources",nan,"By Liana B. Baker, Leila Abboud and Greg Roumeliotis(Reuters) - French telecommunications group Altice SA has held talks to buy Time Warner Cable Inc (NYSE:TWC), and is close to buying smaller peer Suddenlink, moving into the U.S cable market, according to people familiar with the matter.The negotiations with Suddenlink are more advanced and a transaction could be announced later this week, the people said. That deal could be worth $10 billion, including debt, the people added. Time Warner Cable has a market capitalization of $44.5 billion.Since Time Warner Cable's merger with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) fell apart last month, Time Warner Cable is also being circled by small rival  Charter Communications  (NASDAQ:CHTR).If either deal is completed, it would take Altice, which is controlled by French billionaire Patrick Drahi, into the massive cable market of the United States for the first time. Suddenlink would be the first step but Altice could consolidate the U.S. market further, according to one of the sources.Time Warner Cable, which is in large U.S. markets such as New York and Los Angeles, is a much bigger bite for Altice, and it would also face competition from Charter for the asset. Suddenlink is a regional cable company, backed by private-equity firm BC Partners and a Canadian pension fund, which operates in the South and Midwest and has 1.43 million customers.Drahi has turned Altice into a serial acquirer since taking it public in January 2014. Last year alone, the group used its French cable company Numericable to take over the country's second largest mobile carrier SFR, as well as snapping up Portugal Telecom and another operator in the Dominican Republic. These potential U.S. deals could push off a long mooted consolidation in France where Altice has openly said that it would be the natural buyer of number three mobile player  Bouygues  (PARIS:BOUY) Telecom.In recent months Bouygues' owner tycoon Martin Bouygues has said his company is dedicated to remaining independent. Altice, which has been on a buying spree concentrated in Europe in the past year, is making fresh inroads into the United States - a market much more competitive and larger than Europe - thereby signifying a shift in strategy and geographical footprint, one of the sources said. Last week, Altice Chief Executive Dexter Goei said the company will ""continue to be active in M&A"" but has no specific deals to look forward to.BC Partners declined to comment. Suddenlink could not be immediately reached for comment while Time Warner Cable and Altice declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks between Altice and Suddenlink.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

198,"Apr 21, 2015 09:42AM ET",Safran faces AGM heat as revolt over French Florange law widens,nan,"By Tim HepherPARIS (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firms are threatening to block key financial resolutions at French aerospace group  Safran  (PA:SAF), opening a second front in a battle between the French government and institutional investors over a new corporate law.The so-called Florange law is already at the center of a fierce debate over moves to introduce double voting rights for long-term shareholders in French companies to encourage stability.Safran has been able to sidestep the row over ""one share, one vote"" at companies such as  Renault  (PA:RENA) because it already has a system of double-voting for long-term investors that operates smoothly.But it is facing an investor revolt over a second, less publicized, provision of the law that grants more discretion to boards of French companies to repel takeover bids.Proxies representing big investors say they will vote against resolutions granting share issuance authority at Safran's shareholder meeting on Thursday, because they fail to suspend board powers to issue shares whenever a bid is imminent.Such share issues dilute a predator's stake and are seen by their critics as a form of ""poison pill"" that can hurt valuations. The government says clipping the wings of predators is part of its drive to focus on the ""real economy"".""Poison pills limit the powers of decision of shareholders and it is not up to the board to decide for them,"" said Hugo Dubourg, corporate governance analyst at France's Proxinvest.To many, the debate over Safran may seem academic: the maker of engines for France's nuclear missiles is already shielded by decrees protecting the defense sector from hostile bids.It's not the only company where proxy firms are gearing up for a fight over board authority to issue shares, with construction firm  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) also in the firing line.But Thursday's Safran meeting is seen as a potential test case for companies where the French state has a direct stake, setting the scene for a new clash over the Florange Law which groups a number of measures to make the economy less volatile.Safran and Bouygues declined comment.POWER SHIFTThe debate follows a fundamental change of French policy on the power balance between boards and shareholders during bids.Previously in France, the routine shareholder approvals allowing boards to issue shares were suspended in the face of a bid, under a principle known as ""board neutrality"".The term can seem misleading since boards have always been free to make their opinions heard, but until now they could not deploy share defenses without new backing from stockholders.Under the new law, a board can issue shares using existing approvals, even when a bid is imminent or under way. ""Before Florange, a board's hands were tied in the event of a bid and all powers were centralized in the hands of shareholders,"" said Hubert Segain, a Paris partner of international law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.""This was the opposite of the Delaware principle, which gives primacy to the boards of quoted companies in the United States.""In an effort to soften the impact, resolutions to be put before Safran's AGM would allow the board to issue shares during a bid, but would limit this to 9.6 percent of the capital.But firms like Proxinvest and French corporate governance association AFG want shareholders to be consulted on all takeover defenses as a matter of principle.Institutional Shareholder Services, the world's largest proxy advisory firm, has urged investors in French companies to vote against financial resolutions ""if they can be used for anti-takeover purposes without shareholders' approval"".Several French companies have added the limitation sought by proxy firms. Safran, in which the French government owns 18 percent, is the first state-backed firm to ask shareholders to approve the extra board freedoms set out in the new law.Despite opposition, some say Safran's proposed 9.6 percent ceiling could reassure investors that the law can be enforced without driving a wedge between shareholders and the board. ""It's not so much a poison pill as a dose of cough medicine,"" said one French financial source.(The story was refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 10)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Number three mobile operator Bouygues Telecom, which was hardest hit by Iliad's entry to the mobile market, has been aggressively expanding into broadband with cheaper bundles aimed at Iliad's budget-conscious customers. It recruited 415,000 new fixed customers last year, more than rivals, and compared with 228,000 for Iliad. Reynaud said it was too early to know whether Iliad could take back the crown from Bouygues this year. But on Tuesday Free launched a new set-top box featuring Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android TV software and super high definition images known as 4K pitched at the entry-level subscriber. For 2014, the group posted sales up 11.2 percent to 4.17 billion euros ($4.39 billion), and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) up 6.6 percent to 1.28 billion euro. Both were in line with forecasts. Net income rose 4.9 percent to 278.4 million euro, lower than analysts' expectations for 308.65 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Iliad shares have risen 10 percent this year to close at 218.35 euros on Wednesday, giving the group a market value of 12.76 billion euros.($1 = 0.9492 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

202,"Feb 18, 2015 10:51AM ET",Telecoms tycoon seeks to buy out Vivendi from Numericable-SFR,nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Leila AbboudPARIS (Reuters) - Billionaire Patrick Drahi is aiming to buy Vivendi's 20 percent stake in Numericable-SFR to strengthen his grip on France's No.2 telecoms group and prepare for a possible next round of industry consolidation. Drahi's holding company Altice and its subsidiary Numericable-SFR said on Wednesday they had offered Viven (PARIS:VIV)di 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion), or 40 euros a share, for the media firm's stake.While that is well below Numericable-SFR's current share price of over 50 euros, it is above the level at which Vivendi sold SFR to Numericable in November, which analysts say equated to around 33.30 euros.A deal could allow Vivendi to boost a return of cash to shareholders or add to its warchest for acquisitions, while for Drahi it could clear the way for a long-mooted bid for smaller French rival Bouygu (PARIS:BOUY)es Telecom. ""From a Numericable-Altice perspective, this offer could be interpreted as organizing its finances in readiness for a Bouygues Telecom offer,"" said Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis.Telecoms firms across Europe have been striking deals, taking advantage of low interest rates to build up scale and seek cost savings in a saturated market.Under Drahi's proposal, Numericable-SFR would pay half the offered sum to Vivendi in cash by buying back its shares, pending approval from shareholders in an April 30 vote. Altice would pay the rest by April 7, 2016, plus interest. Vivendi said its management board would examine the offer and its supervisory board, which next meets on Feb. 27, would decide on any action.Vivendi sold telecoms group SFR to cable company Numericable for 13.37 billion euros in November, and was supposed to remain a minority shareholder for at least a year. It holds two board seats, and Altice had options to buy Vivendi's shares between the 19th and 43rd month after closing.If it does accept, it would add to the cash pile Vivendi has accumulated from sales in the past two years as it exited telecoms and kept only its music and pay-TV businesses. Led by chairman and largest shareholder Vincent Bollore, Vivendi wants to expand its existing media activities, possibly also via acquisitions.Jefferies' Dellis estimates Vivendi had 8 billion euros net cash at the end of 2014, and said the Altice move would renew speculation of a larger return of cash to shareholders in 2015 than the 3.5 billion euros already planned. ""We remain skeptical that Vivendi shareholders will receive as much as some hope given management's presumed incentive to retain maximum capacity to re-engineer the rump media business and put it on a firmer growth footing,"" wrote Dellis. In November, Altice CEO Dexter Goei said his company viewed itself as the ""natural buyer"" of Bouygues Telecom and was open to talks. In recent days media reports have said Altice was preparing an offer for Bouygues, though Bouygues said no talks were underway.Separately, Numericable-SFR published pro-forma results for 2014 with revenue coming in at 11.4 billion euros. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stood at 3.1 billion euros, while pro-forma capital expenditure was 1.8 billion euros.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

208,"Jul 31, 2014 07:02PM ET",France's Iliad challenges Sprint for control of T-Mobile,nan,"By Soyoung Kim and Leila Abboud PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - French telecommunications company Iliad SA (PA:ILD) has made a surprise offer for T-Mobile US Inc (N:TMUS), setting up a potential bidding war with Sprint Corp (N:S), the U.S. mobile carrier now controlled by Japan's Softbank Corp (T:9984).Iliad, which has shaken up the French mobile and broadband market in the past decade with its cheap, pared-down subscriber plans, bid $15 billion in cash for 56.6 percent of T-Mobile US at $33 per share, it said in a statement on Thursday.The Paris-based company said its offer for the fourth-largest U.S. carrier values all of T-Mobile at $36.20 per share, a premium of 42 percent over the pre-announcement share price.That is less than the roughly $40 per share Sprint agreed to pay under the broad terms of an agreement worked out with Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), T-Mobile's majority owner. The terms of that proposal, which followed months of talks and which was reported by Reuters in early June, would value T-Mobile at nearly $32 billion.Deutsche Telekom and Sprint declined to comment, and a representative for Softbank could not be reached.Despite Iliad's lower offer, a person close to the French company said founder Xavier Niel believes he has a strong card to play because his bid would not face the antitrust scrutiny that confronts Sprint in trying to merge the third and fourth-biggest U.S. mobile operators.""SoftBank has been told in many very clear coded words that the Department of Justice and the FCC would probably not approve the acquisition,"" said Reed Hundt, a former chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. ""There's no question to me that the FCC would say 'bienvenue'"" to the proposed Iliad deal.The FCC and Department of Justice expressed a desire earlier this year to have at least two more network operators competing against AT&T and Verizon.The T-Mobile offer is Niel's most audacious attempt at extending his reach beyond France, Monaco and Israel, where he owns part of operator Golan Telecom. Still, his bid to enter the United States mobile market is a long shot, some investors and analysts say.The French company specializes in broadband and lacks experience in mobile, T-Mobile's main business, having launched its mobile service only in 2012. It is also unfamiliar with the demands of competing in the United States, with its massive coverage needs and deep-pocketed competition from AT&T Inc (N:T) and Verizon Communications Inc (N:VZ), the market leaders.Iliad expects $10 billion in savings from the deal, although it is unclear where they would come from because the company has no U.S. operations.The Iliad offer could falter on price alone, said Joseph Mastrogiovanni and Michael Baresich, analysts at CreditSuisse.""We are sceptical that T-Mobile and its shareholders, including Deutsche Telekom, will find this bid attractive,"" they wrote in a research note. ""However, it could put pressure on Sprint to move sooner rather later.EMPIRE BUILDINGFew doubt the scale of Neil's ambitions. The entrepreneur, an unknown outsider in France when he started out, has joined the elite, lunching with ministers, starting a tech school, and holding part ownership of the influential Le Monde newspaper.He earned his first fortune from an adult chat and dating service on the Minitel, a rudimentary computer network that pre-dated the Internet in France. He then surfed on a wave of market liberalisation in telecoms to create Iliad.In many ways Niel is similar to Masayoshi Son, the head of Softbank and his rival for T-Mobile US. Both have operated their companies as challengers who cut prices and take on larger rivals with bigger resources.Niel sees the U.S. market as ripe for the kind of challenge Iliad mounted in France, where its entry into the mobile market in 2012 sent prices down 30 percent and hurt the profits of bigger rivals Orange SA (PA:ORAN) and SFR, as well as Bouygues SA (PA:BOUY). He ranks 133rd on Forbes' list of billionaires, with a net worth of $9.5 billion.Son, who is also Sprint's chairman, has pledged to start a price war in the United States, and he has said industry consolidation would allow Sprint to compete more effectively against Verizon and AT&T. He owns 19.3 percent of Softbank and is 46th on the Forbes list, with a net worth of $18.4 billion.T-MOBILE TURNAROUNDT-Mobile would appear well-suited for the role of challenger championed by Niel and Son. Last year, it turned around years of subscriber losses using a strategy that eliminated contracts, restructured plans and set off a race to slash prices across the industry.Earlier on Thursday, T-Mobile posted a net profit after a year of losses, and reported the industry's largest post-paid phone subscriber additions of the quarter.T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere, known for his outspoken and sometimes abrasive style, has come to define T-Mobile's new audacity, epitomized by his frontal attacks on competitors, offering to pay early termination fees for customers who defect from rivals, for example.""We know this is a scale industry. Scale brings advantage,"" T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter told Reuters earlier on Thursday.""What we've seen so far is a glimpse of what real competition in this industry looks like. If we could turbo-charge it, it could be an incredible opportunity to bring more competition to the market.""BIG BITE FOR ILIADIliad said it would finance its offer, which was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal, through a mix of equity and debt, and that it already had the backing of unnamed international banks.Nevertheless, the deal would be a big bite for Iliad. Its market capitalization of just above $16 billion compared with about $25 billion for T-Mobile US.T-Mobile owner Deustsche Telekom will now have the benefit of two bidders.A person at Deutsche Telekom familiar with the talks also said a deal with Iliad had a certain appeal because of the lower risk of being blocked by U.S. regulators.Three years ago, regulators rejected AT&T's $39 billion bid for T-Mobile US, which resulted in AT&T paying Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's full owner, a reverse break-up fee of $6 billion in cash and U.S. mobile assets.T-Mobile shares closed up 6.5 percent at $32.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. Sprint shares were down 5.3 percent at $7.35.(Reporting by Edwin Chan in San Francisco, Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore, Marina Lopes, Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh in Washington, Harro Ten Wolde and Peter Maushagen in Frankfurt; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Greg Mahlich, Tom Brown and Andre Grenon)"

212,"Jul 01, 2014 09:00AM ET",Alstom minority investors criticise GE deal,nan,"By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet PARIS (Reuters) - Minority shareholders in Alstom (PA:ALSO) criticised its planned tie-up with General Electric (N:GE), saying they had not been given enough information, and some voiced concern about the French government's influence as a result of the deal. The French train and turbine maker last month agreed a $16.9 billion deal with GE that will see the U.S. conglomerate acquiring most of Alstom's energy business. The deal, which sparked a two-month tug-of-war with the government, is expected to close in the first half of 2015. The deal will have to win the two-thirds majority approval from Alstom shareholders during an extraordinary meeting in the fourth quarter, Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron told the firm's annual shareholder meeting in Paris on Tuesday. It is not clear at this stage whether the firm's biggest shareholder Bouygues (PA:BOUY), with a 29 percent stake, will take part in the vote or accede to calls from some minority investors to step aside because of its role in the deal. The government gave its blessing to the tie-up only after it won the option to buy 20 percent of Alstom from the construction group. With the second-biggest Alstom shareholder having a stake of about just 5 percent, minority investors could play an important role if Bouygues decides not to participate in the vote. A Bouygues spokesman declined to comment. Throughout Tuesday's shareholder meeting, several minority shareholders voiced concern over the future shape and governance of the firm, which will be refocused on transport and is set to have the French state as its top shareholder. Colette Neuville of shareholder lobby ADAM complained that minority investors had not been given enough information on the value of Alstom's various assets. She noted that Alstom shares had slumped over 10 percent since the deal was announced. ""I think this slump in shares is due to the fact we don't really know what role the state will play in the future Alstom,"" she said. CASH The government had threatened for weeks to veto the sale of most of Alstom's power arm to GE, saying it would not let a strategic power and rail group be ""devoured"" by a foreign firm. It pressured GE to dramatically reshape its offer to include commitments to create local jobs and set up joint ventures giving Alstom a future in the power sector. Alstom will also buy GE's rail signalling unit as part of the deal. The government agreed to the deal after it won the option to buy Alstom shares from Bouygues, saying the move would help ensure that GE fully meets its demands. Alstom will be reaping 12.35 billion euros from the GE deal, but will re-invest about 2.5 billion euros into three 50:50 joint ventures created in its electricity grid, renewable energy and nuclear power businesses. Alstom has said it plans to use the proceeds to pay off debt, strengthen its transport arm via acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, but has not provided a breakdown. On Tuesday, Kron said only that Alstom would have 7.5 billion euros cash in excess of what is needed to pay off its 3 billion euros of debt. Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Tissot said on the sidelines of the meeting that after investing in the joint ventures and buying GE's rail signalling unit, Alstom would be left with around 4.3 billion euros in cash. Alstom shares closed 1.1 percent lower. Analysts at JPMorgan have cut their price target to 27 euros a share from 33 euros, below analysts' consensus for 31 euros, stressing that GE's amended deal came with less cash and more complexity. ""What a shame, it could have been so good,"" they wrote. They said GE's initial offer would have provided Alstom with a ""clean start"" as a company refocused exclusively on transport. They now expect from Alstom a cash distribution of 6 euros per share, compared with up to 18 euros with GE's original offer.  (Editing by James Regan and Pravin Char) "

223,"Aug 31, 2011 01:32PM ET",European shares close higher after torrid month,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index closes up 2.9 pct * Bouygues jumps after share buyback * Worst monthly performance since Oct 2008
 By Joanne Frearson	 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - European shares ended higher on
Wednesday on hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve would support the
fragile recovery with fresh stimulus measures, but that did not
prevent shares recording their worst monthly drop since October
2008.	Stocks were given a boost by the U.S. Federal Reserve
stimulus hopes after minutes from the Fed's Aug. 9 meeting
revealed some officials had pressed for a more aggressive plan.
 	""Any further stimulus is going to produce a positive response
in the market,"" said Bill Dinning, head of investment strategy
at Aegon Asset Management in Edinburgh, which has 48.8 billion
pounds ($79.4 billion) under management.	 Mining stocks, whose performance is highly correlated to
economic growth, featured among the best performers, with the
STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index rising 4.1
percent.	 The mining index has dropped 19.5 percent since July as
concerns have escalated about a slowdown in economic growth and
fears have grown the United States could fall into recession
after a slew of weak economic data and a credit downgrade.        Bouygues jumped 15.8 percent to become the top
riser in Europe in volume seven fold its 90-day daily average
after the French conglomerate announced a share buyback
following a recent slump in its share price. 	 Merger and acquisition talk lifted shares in Smith & Nephew
 , up 4.9 percent in volume three times its 90-day daily
average to make it one of the top movers on the FTSE 100 index
 .	 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares closed up 2.9 percent at 967.09 points, but fell 10.6
percent for the month - its worst monthly performance since
October 2008, just after the Lehman Brothers collapse.	 The index extended gains in afternoon trade after U.S.
factory activity data and U.S. Chicago PMI figures showed there
was still growth in the sectors, suggesting the United States
would avoid slipping into recession.    	 ""The market is dominated by the macro data and highly
sensitive to any good news on the economy and the U.S. PMI data
and U.S. factory orders were better than expected,"" Bob Parker,
senior adviser at Credit Suisse, said.    	 U.S. private sector jobs data, which is seen as precursor to
the all important Friday's non-farm payroll data also helped
ease worries that growth is stalling after it came in largely
in-line with expectations.	 The index pushed above a key resistance level, the 23.6
percent Fibonacci retracement or 941.36 points from its recent
July-August sell-off, with the next resistance level seen at the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement or 974.3.  	  WORRIES AHEAD	 The sharp falls have wiped more than $750 billion off share
values and volumes have been high.	 August which is traditionally a quiet month, with many fund
managers and traders on holiday, has seen the highest trading
turnover in almost three years. 	 A Reuters poll of 17 Europe-based asset management firms
showed fund managers cut positions in equities and raised cash,
with a typical balanced portfolio only holding 41.2 percent in
August compared to 47.0 percent in July. 	There were signs the tough economic environment were taking
its toll on company earnings.	L'Oreal was down 1.6 percent to feature in the
bottom performers list after it said trading in Western Europe
was becoming difficult to predict as worries about a slowdown in
consumer demand have grown.    	""It is a trading rally in what remains a challenging
environment, the growth rate is still slow and this could lead
to earnings downgrades,"" Dinning said.

224,"Aug 31, 2011 05:36AM ET",European shares rallying at end of weak month,nan," * FTSEurofirst up 1.4 percent * Index on track for biggest monthly fall since 2008 * Carrefour down after profit warning * ADP jobs report, other key data awaited
 By Brian Gorman	 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - European shares were sharply
higher on Wednesday morning, extending a rally into a third
session ahead of a raft of U.S. data this week that may
determine whether the Federal Reserve acts to boost the
struggling U.S. economy. 	 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
was up 1.4 percent at 952.76 points at 0906 GMT, after rising 1
percent in the previous session. It was on track to fall 12
percent in August, the biggest monthly fall since October 2008. 	  Investors have cut exposure to risky assets such as stocks
following an escalation of the euro zone debt crisis, the United
States losing its AAA credit rating and weak data from major
economies that sparked concern they may go back into recession. 
  	 Stocks rose across the board on Wednesday, with miners among
the biggest gainers. The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index
 was up 1.7 percent, though still down 28 percent in
2011.	 Copper prices edged up, supported by a strike threat at the
Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia and news of lower output from
Chile.	  Investors awaited the ADP employment report, weekly
mortgage market index, Challenger job cuts, factory orders, the
Institute for Supply Management-New York's index of regional
business activity and the ISM Chicago's index of manufacturing
activity.  	 ""The ADP report will be important to the mood of the market
before the non-farm payrolls data on Friday. Given the
uncertainty over the U.S. economy, the payroll numbers are as
important as ever,"" said Richard Jeffrey, chief investment
officer at Cazenove Capital Management.	 ""The market has been shaken, and you would not call it
resilient. But in the absence of bad news, it will probably
drift higher.  Over the summer period reality has been dawning,
with investors realising  that the recovery is not going to be
straightforward.""	 The insurance sector rose 2.1 percent, led by
Allianz , up 4 percent, after Goldman Sachs upgraded it
to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" .	 ""In our view, Allianz has been sold off on what we see as
excessive concerns over the sustainability of life earnings
owing to the fall in German 10-year yields,"" Goldman said.	 Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1 percent,
Germany's DAX and France's CAC40 were both up
1.5 percent. 	 U.S. stocks rose for a third straight day on Tuesday in a
volatile session, after minutes from the latest Fed meeting
boosted expectations the U.S. central bank will act again to
stimulate the economy. 	  VALUATIONS	 The August sell-off has created buying opportunities,
strategists say. Equity valuations on Thomson Reuters Datastream
showed the STOXX Europe 600 carrying a one-year forward
price-to-earnings of 8.7, against a 10-year average of more than
13.  	 ""Stock markets look a bit undervalued at the moment. There
is potential for better times ahead,"" said Lothar Mentel, chief
investment officer at Octopus Investments, which manages $4
billion. 	 He said more quantitative easing was ""not on the cards"" at
the moment, adding:  ""The Fed is particularly concerned about
the U.S. and the western world stumbling into a liquidity trap,
interest rates low and inflation low. You get the Japanese
disease of people postponing consumption, investment. If they
need to stoke inflation they will.""	 Economic news in the euro zone's biggest economy surprised
on the upside. German retail sales held steady in July in real
terms, avoiding a drop expected by economists and showing
resilience in the face of falling consumer confidence.
 	 Among individual shares, French telecom, media and
construction group Bouygues soared 11 percent after
moving to address the recent sharp fall in its share price with
a planned 1.25 billion-euro ($1.8 billion) share buyback and an
upgrade of its 2011 sales target. 	 Finnish paper maker UPM-Kymmene Oyj rose 9
percvent after announcing plans to shut several
mills. 	 Carrefour , Europe's largest retailer, fell 3.3
percent after saying full-year profits would slump 15 percent as
it cuts prices in a bid to reverse market share losses in its
home market and elsewhere in Europe.

 By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The European Commission
unveiled guidelines on Thursday specifying how public funds can
be used to help companies roll out high-speed broadband
networks, and help EU countries benefit from new technologies. Under the rules, state aid would be easier to obtain for
projects in so-called grey areas where broadband infrastructure
does not exist such as rural regions, and more difficult for
""black areas"" or cities with more than one network operator. The EU executive has pledged to make high-speed Internet an
important element of its economic recovery plan to drive growth
in the 27-nation bloc and hopes to achieve 100 percent broadband
coverage in the European Union by 2010. ""While this investment should be made mostly by private
companies, there is an important role for public investment in
achieving the widest possible access to broadband in underserved
and non-profitable areas,"" Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes
told reporters. ""Public investments in line with the present guidelines will
significantly contribute to shrinking the digital divide -- both
within and between European Union member states,"" she said.
Industry operators were generally positive on the state aid
guidelines. ""We see a potentially crucial role for the state wherever
private investors are not rolling out fibre networks which can
be continually upgraded and are open to competition,"" said
director Ilsa Godlovitch from the European Competitive
Telecommunication Association (ECTA). She said it was equally important not to crowd out private
investments where open networks are being built.
ECTA members include BT, Bouygues Telecom, SFR which is
jointly owned by Vivendi and Vodafone, and AT&T. The bigger operators could stand to gain from the new rules
as they expand their networks, said Michael Bartholomew,
director at European Telecommunications Network Operators'
Association (ETNO), which represents 41 telecoms operators in 34
European countries. ""Realistically, I would imagine the larger operators could
be the largest beneficiaries simply because they have the
resources available to make these kind of investments in rural,
outlying areas where there is no competition,"" he said. The Commission said 200-300 billion euros ($295 billion to
$443 billion) would be needed in coming years for building NGA
networks. It said recipients of state aid would have to allow
competitors access to its networks and not favour any particular
technology.

10-month high on Friday on optimism for a global economic
recovery and with Nokia  and results from U.S.
bellwethers boosting the technology sector. The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares
rose 1 percent to 978.34 points. Over the week, the index
climbed 1.2 percent, its sixth weekly gain in the last seven
weeks. The European benchmark index is up more than 51 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more
confident on the prospects of economic recovery. ""Things look good for the time being, but the higher we go
the more we could be setting ourselves up for a disappointment,""
said Andy Lynch, a fund manager at Schroders. ""The world economy is doing well, French and German GDP are
positive, but that's not surprising given the amount of stimulus
being pumped into the market. I have a concern about what
happens when the sugar rush is withdrawn, though that may be a
problem for 2010, rather than now."" Nokia  rose 3.1 percent, taking its gain in the
last three sessions to 9.9 percent, with traders citing positive
momentum following the announcement of its first Linux phone to
compete with Apple's  iPhone. STMicroelectronics  rose 12.4 percent after a
bullish note on the chipmaker from Banc of America-Merrill
Lynch, which raised its price target for the stock by 17 percent
to 7 euros, and retained its ""buy"" rating. The sector was further boosted by upbeat statements from
U.S. bellwethers. Intel  raised its third-quarter
outlook and results at Dell  were ahead of forecasts.

spending rose as expected in July, lifted by the government's
""cash-for-clunkers"" programme that fuelled demand for autos. The
Commerce Department said spending rose 0.2 percent after rising
by a revised 0.6 percent in June, previously reported as a 0.4
percent gain.  [ID:nN28359458] The European benchmark had risen to a 10-month high of

unemployment and dismal personal finances. [ID:nN28361747]  L'OREAL RISES  Among other individual movers, L'Oreal  advanced

 (Adds CEO comments from call, details)  PARIS, July 24 (Reuters) - TF1, France's leading commercial
television broadcaster, on Friday kept its cautious outlook in a
still-tough advertising climate as it reported a plunge in
first-half profits.  TF1's first half net profit fell 61 percent from a year
earlier to 49 million euros ($69.57 million), while operating
profit slumped 78 percent to 38 million euros. Sales fell 16
percent to 1.13 billion euros. The global financial crisis has resulted in deep cuts to
advertising budgets which have hit TV companies, advertisers and
other media groups. Chief Executive Nonce Paolini said during a conference call
with analysts that July followed June trends on advertising
sales but was ""less difficult"" than previous months. There was still strong pressure on advertising prices in
July and August, finance head Philippe Denery said. TF1, which attracts around one-half of France's TV
advertising spending, has also seen its audience share come
under pressure from competing free digital terrestrial
television (DTT) channels and the Internet. Although French advertising group Publicis said earlier this
week that it hoped the worst of the sector's downturn was behind
it, French media group Lagardere said it still lacked visibility
on the advertising market. TF1 maintained its business plan of working on the basis
that full-year consolidated revenues would fall 13 percent,
saying it could not set more precise guidance. ""In the current economic environment, with visibility still
poor, it is not possible to set full-year guidance for
revenues,"" TF1 said in a statement. The company said it had cut 31 million euros of costs in the
first half, out of a planned 70 million euros of cost cuts for
the full year. TF1 shares closed down 2.2 percent at 8.65 euros on Friday,
giving the company a market capitalisation of around 1.85
billion euros. Its shares have fallen around 17 percent since
the start of 2009 and fell 43 percent last year. French conglomerate Bouygues owns around 43 percent of TF1's
share capital. (additional reporting by Cyril Altmeyer) ($1=.7043 Euro)

operator, and Bouygues Telecom have not been hurt so far by the
economic crisis, top company executives told Reuters on Friday. ""No, there is no impact,"" Maxime Lombardini said on the

any effect on Iliad's business. He would not comment on second-quarter trends, but added
that the group planned to stick to its investment plans for a
fiber optics network. Bouygues Telecom was also resisting well to the crisis,
Deputy Chief Executive Emmanuel Forest told Reuters at the
conference. ""It isn't really having any impact for now,"" Forest said. However, a decline in travel abroad as customers tighten
their budgets and pressure from European Union regulations on
charges could impact the company's revenue from roaming fees. ""We'll see in July/August what happens to travel,"" he said.
 Paris-based Iliad, parent of French Internet service
provider Free, which recently bought provider Alice from Telecom
Italia, has said it would invest 1 billion euros to build a
fiber optics network. Last month, Iliad said it would pay the 240 million euros
for a fourth 3G mobile phone licence in France recommended by
the country's CPT shareholding agency, which helps the
government value its assets. Iliad, the sole candidate for a first auction in 2007 that
did not succeed, is once more seen as the frontrunner for the
upcoming auction.

 (Adds more details) By Dominique Vidalon and Cyril Altmeyer PARIS, July 2 (Reuters) - French telecoms group SFR had a
strong second quarter in terms of new subscribers for mobile and
fixed-phones and is ahead of its sales targets on the iPhone
smart phone, its chief executive said on Thursday. Frank Esser told a group of reporters on the sideline of a
telecoms conference that: ""We had a good momentum, a very strong
second quarter in mobile and in fixed phones."" Esser was answering a query over subscription levels. SFR, which started selling the iPhone in April, has
currently sold over 200,000 units and was ""ahead"" of its targets
despite a global economic downturn. Esser declined to disclose what these targets were. ""If one looks at the iPhone, one sees that people are ready
to spend more,"" he said. SFR, which last year bought fixed-phone operator Neuf
Cegetel, has no immediate plans to launch a ""quadruple play""
offer (internet, television, fixed-phone and mobile phone) for
the consumer market, he said. Some analysts expect SFR to react to Ideo, the first
quadruple-play offer in France launched by Bouygues Telecom on
May 25 for 44.90 euros per month.  ""We are not against it but it is not our priority,"" he
said. ""If there is a real demand from clients, we will react but
for now it is not the case,"" Esser added. Esser said it was too early to say if and when SFR would
accelerate investment in fibre optics. ""We will spend over 200 million euros in fibre this year. We
are keeping our pace,"" he said French telecoms regulator Arcep last week recommended using
the multifibre solution in large cities. That solution uses one
fibre per operator to connect a household and had been backed by
Iliad and SFR. France Telecom had been asking for a monofibre solution,
where one fibre is used for all operators to connect individuals
in one building. France's Vivendi has a 56 percent stake in SFR and Britain's
Vodafone Group Plc has 44 percent. SFR is France's No. 2 mobile operator behind France

on Thursday after data showing a record decline in euro zone
industrial orders dimmed hopes that the economic downturn may
soon come to an end. At 1120 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was 1.3 percent lower at
842.22 points, giving back some of the 2.4 percent gain posted
in the previous session. The index has rebounded more than 30 percent since hitting a
record low on March 9, and is on track to post the best
quarterly gain since late 1999, but is still down 48 percent
from the multi-year peak reached in mid-2007. ""The equities market had been a one-way bet but now there
are doubts about the recovery, given recent forecasts from the
World Bank and the OECD,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist
at Charles Stanley. ""This is the time of year when analysts revise their
earnings for next year. They had earnings growth of 20 percent
for 2010, but given the backdrop, that looks unlikely.""
Investors nerves were also rattled by comments on Wednesday
from the Federal Reserve, which warned that U.S economic
weakness would remain for a time while keeping interest rates
close to zero. Banks were a major drag on the index. Standard Chartered
fell 3.1 percent after the Asia-focused lender reported record
levels of income and profit in the first five months of this
year but warned wholesale credit quality had deteriorated in the
second quarter.. HSBC, which also has a strong Asia focus, fell 1.4 percent.
UBS and Credit Suisse shed between 4.3 and 3.5 percent.
 French bank Credit Agricole dropped 4.9 percent on market
talk that the lender's results could come in lower than
analysts' consensus, traders said. A spokesman for the bank
declined to comment. Drugmakers were also under pressure, led by falls in
Sanofi-Aventis, which shed 2.9 percent, as analysts cited
concerns that its key blockbuster diabetes treatment Lantus
might be linked to cancer risk. Officials at Sanofi said the
drug was safe. GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis fell 1.2 and 2.5 percent
respectively. Telecoms stocks fell after Goldman Sachs downgraded the
European telecom services sector to ""neutral"" from ""attractive"". Vodafone, Telenor and TeliaSonera shed between 1.1 and 1.7
percent.  Bucking the trend, shares in Telecom Italia gained 3
percent, supported by an upgrade to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" by
Milan broker Equita, and as Goldman Sachs added the stock to its
""Conviction Buy list"". Energy shares were mostly lower. Royal Dutch Shell fell 1.3
percent after Nigeria's main militant group raided its pipeline
and disrupted a major export terminal. BASF, the world's largest chemicals maker, fell 3.3 percent
after saying it will dismantle a plant producing plastics for
packaging, stepping up efforts to cut capacity as demand shows
little signs of recovery.  BOUYGUES GAINS Among the gainers, France's Bouygues rose 3.7 percent after
Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on the stock to ""buy"" from
""neutral"". Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz gained 1.4
percent after posting second-quarter profits above market
expectations. Porsche surged 4.6 percent, propelled by renewed speculation
that the carmaker was close to a deal with Qatar to give the
Gulf state a shareholding in Volkswagen, a move that would clear
the way for the two German manufacturers to merge. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.8 percent,

234,"Jan 05, 2009 06:25AM ET",French unions decry TV advertising change,nan," By Anna Willard PARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - French public television will stop
evening commercials on Monday in a move unions say will benefit
private stations and increase President Nicolas Sarkozy's grip
on the media. The publicly owned France Televisions will no longer show
advertising between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. as part of a broadcasting
shakeup proposing a total ban from 2011. Unions and opposition Socialists say the reform, announced
by Sarkozy a year ago, will weaken the financial foundations of
the four main state TV channels, lead to job losses and
strengthen private broadcasters favourable to Sarkozy. The government says the reforms will improve the quality of
programming on public television by freeing it from ""the tyranny
of ratings"" and it has pledged to make up for any shortfall in
advertising revenues. The measures will allow the government to appoint the head
of France Televisions directly and critics say France risks
returning to the days of the ORTF, the tame state broadcaster of
the postwar years. ""It will lead to a serious and long lasting weakening of the
public media,"" Socialist Senator Catherine Tasca said in Le
Parisien newspaper on Monday. Culture Minister Christine Albanel, who has been in charge
of shepherding the new law through parliament, dismissed the
criticism of changes she said were one of the biggest
broadcasting reforms in decades. ""There is always a sort of hesitation in the face of big
reforms. People have the impression of liking what they know,
even if they criticised it previously,"" she told LCE television
on Sunday night.  OPPOSITION Sarkozy's friendship with media bosses like Martin Bouygues,
head of France's biggest private television broadcaster TF1 or
Vincent Bollore, the tycoon whose yacht he used for a holiday
after his 2007 election victory have increased suspicions. After determined campaigning by opposition Socialists, the
measures have still not passed into law and the end to
advertising has only come into effect because of a voluntary
agreement by the management of France Televisions. The bill was only passed in the lower house of parliament in
December after four weeks of debate and some 700 proposed
amendments and debate in the Senate begins this week. Public sector broadcast staff staged several strikes in 2008
and unions of the France 3 channel have called for action on
Monday. A strike is also expected on France 2 on Wednesday.  The reform creates a funding gap for public TV which will
largely be filled by a levy on private broadcasters and Internet
providers and by government support. The 2009 budget includes 450 million euros to compensate for
the loss of revenue but critics fear a slowing economy and
falling state revenues will make future funding vulnerable. Industry experts say the reform will not be a jackpot for
private television, but just allow them to survive a difficult
advertising market.

235,"Dec 04, 2008 04:00AM ET",UPDATE 1-French unemployment edges up to 7.7 pct in Q3,nan," (Adds details, reaction throughout) By Anna Willard PARIS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - France's unemployment rate rose
slightly in the third quarter, according to official data on
Thursday, as companies cut jobs in response to the financial
crisis and a slowing economy. The unemployment rate climbed to 7.7 percent from an
unrevised 7.6 percent in the second quarter, national statistics
office INSEE said. Economists have been expecting the number of jobless in
France to climb after the economy contracted in the second
quarter and narrowly escaped recession with growth of just 0.1
percent in the third. ""The economy is undergoing a strong slowdown even if we're
not officially in recession,"" said Dominique Barbet, economist
at BNP Paribas. ""The situation is quite clear and the deterioration of the
job market is tangible. The result is that the unemployment rate
is rising."" The unemployment rate excluding France's overseas
territories also climbed to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in the
second quarter.  INSEE no longer publishes a monthly unemployment figure
after a controversy over the method of calculation in 2006. However, the European Union statistics office Eurostat does
and it said on Nov. 28 that the jobless rate rose to 8.2 percent
in October from 8.0 percent in September, putting France above
the euro zone rate of 7.7 percent. ""Even if INSEE underestimates slightly that increase, the
rate is going to continue to rise,"" Barbet said.  STIMULUS President Nicolas Sarkozy's government has also forecast a
worsening job market but Economy Minister Christine Lagarde
played down the rise. ""The unemployment rate in metropolitan France rose slightly
in the third quarter despite a difficult economic context,"" her
office said in a statement. Sarkozy will unveil measures later on Thursday to help
France withstand the crisis and is expected to announce steps to
help the car and construction sectors where several companies
are making steep job cuts. Sarkozy will speak at a Renault  factory in Douai
in northern France at 1100 GMT. Renault is planning 6,000 job cuts across Europe while PSA
Peugeot-Citroen  is planning to cut 2,700 jobs in
France. French property group Nexity  has said it would cut
500 jobs and Bouygues  said on Monday it saw the
slowdown hitting its real estate operations in 2010. France is also hoping for help from the European Central
Bank which is meeting on Thursday and is expected cut interest
rates for the third time in less than two months. It is expected
to cut by at least 50 basis points. ""Given that there are no real growth prospects, inflation is
not a concern today, and with people even worrying about
deflation, the ECB has a role to play to re-launch the economy,""
said Bruno Cavalier, economist at Oddo.
