35,"Jul 30, 2018 12:10PM ET",Earnings misses and tech fragility drag European stocks down,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares retreated from a six-week high on Monday as industrials and tech stocks slipped and disappointing earnings, including from brewer Heineken, dented investors' confidence.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.3 percent, starting a packed earnings week on the back foot after sealing on Friday its strongest weekly gain in nearly five weeks. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.5 percent.A negative open on Wall Street also comforted traders to stick to a risk-off mode until the close.Shares in Heineken (AS:HEIO) tumbled 6.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after the world's second largest beer maker reported weaker than expected first-half earnings and cut its full-year margin guidance.""Heineken’s first-half EPS missed expectations due to the consolidation of Kirin Brasil, adverse currency effects and higher input costs,"" Liberum analysts said in a note.France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) fell 2.5 percent to the bottom of the CAC 40 (FCHI) after its first-half operating income proved disappointing.Another faller after earnings was  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG), which declined 2 percent after the world's largest maker of medical-imaging gear reported a 10 percent slump in net profit, driven down by a strong dollar.Its parent company Siemens (DE:SIEGn) also fell 0.4 percent, one of the biggest weights among industrials stocks.Several companies however delivered positive results, including German industrial machinery group GEA (DE:G1AG), which rose 4.5 percent to a three-month high after it reported.""GEA Group’s second-quarter figures are characterized by better than (expected) order intake, partially wiping out the 1Q18 slump, solid sales growth and operating earnings surpassing the 2Q17 level and expectations,"" Baader Helvea analysts said.British bookmaker GVC (L:GVC), which owns the  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral brands, climbed 5.4 percent to a record high after announcing it had sealed a joint venture with MGM Resorts (N:MGM) to set up an online betting platform in the United States.Shore Capital analyst Greg Johnson said U.S. sports betting could grow to be a $20 billion market, and saw a 10 percent market share as potentially generating value of 270p per share for GVC.""A tie-up with MGM significantly increases the chances of achieving such a market position with a lower risk profile.""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares also rose 2.9 percent after the German lender said it had moved a large part of its euro clearing activity to Frankfurt from London.TECH PAIN, FINANCIALS GAINEarnings aside, the tech sector (SX8P) declined 1.6 percent, reflecting moves in Asia and Wall Street after shocking drops in big tech names Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) last week shook investors' belief in tech's resilience.  Cap Gemini  (PA:CAPP) and SAP (DE:SAPG), heavyweights in tech, fell 2.2 and 2.9 percent.Financials, on the other hand, provided the biggest boost to overall index gains. They remain, however, the worst-performing sector year-to-date.After visiting clients, Citi analysts said U.S. investors remain underweight on EU banks but had more interest in buying them than on any of their recent marketing trips. Overall, MSCI Europe earnings are expected to grow 8.4 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. Earnings growth for the index is also being revised up for 2018 and 2019.But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts say the rate of positive earnings surprises is trailing the historical average thus far in Q2.

48,"Feb 01, 2018 10:50AM ET",European tech gets second wind after record-breaking 2017,nan,"By Helen Reid and Tom Pfeiffer LONDON (Reuters) - When German semiconductor maker Infineon slashed its revenue guidance on Wednesday because of a weakening dollar, its shares tumbled to the bottom of the benchmark DAX index. But as the impact of the announcement wore off, investors bid the stock higher and it closed the day down just 1 percent, leaving it up 37 percent in the past year. The comeback underscores how European technology stocks are on a roll again after a rapid run-up in 2017 left investors wary of eye-watering valuations and switched to more cyclical industries in December as the global economy picked up steam. Tech was by far the strongest sector in global stocks last year. Flows data from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill-Lynch last week showed $2.1 billion poured into tech sector funds, a record figure. Europe's stock markets are not breaking records like Wall Street is, but in tech, European valuations are higher than their U.S. counterparts on a share price to forward earnings basis. http://tmsnrt.rs/2Eu48lBWhile U.S. tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are growing fast, their focus on consumer end-markets puts them squarely in the sights of regulators and consumer watchdogs monitoring their market dominance and policing of online content. Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com all announce earnings later on Thursday.European tech is more focused on business-to-business areas such as industrial automation, connected home appliances, business management software and self-driving car components. Tech is leading Europe's earnings recovery. While European earnings overall are struggling to reach and surpass their pre-financial-crisis peak, tech stocks' earnings have hit their highest level since the tech bubble of 2001. http://tmsnrt.rs/2DPEqadThe head of Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) said on Thursday its mobile networks business, which has struggled with declining demand since 2015, was showing signs of a rebound, sending its shares up 14 percent. Austria's AMS soared 26 percent on Monday after it boosted revenue guidance on rising demand for its optical sensors from Apple and others. Wesley Lebeau, portfolio manager of CPR's global disruption fund, said he was avoiding some well-known European digital economy stocks such as Delivery Hero, Zalando or Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-a-Porter, saying they are more expensive than U.S. peers. ""In Europe what is interesting is on the component side,"" he said. ""AMS has done a fantastic job to get ahead of U.S. and Asian rivals in terms of 3D sensors... They are starting to be a key differentiator."" MULTIPLES HIGHER, STILL BULLISHChipmaking machine supplier ASML squarely beat profit expectations in the fourth quarter and said many customers were asking for early delivery of its equipment. Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors is a buyer of ASML, even as China tries to become a global force in semiconductor making. ""This is where barriers to entry are so important,"" said Marcus Morris-Eyton, European equities portfolio manager at Allianz GI. ""ASML are supplying the machines... with their EUV lithography technology you literally have a 30-year runway of growth because the order book is so visible.""Morris-Eyton has 26 percent of his fund invested in tech. That includes Infineon, despite the stock's massive gains in 2017. He points to Infineon's big market share in electric vehicle components. He also holds Zalando, which he believes can be classified as a tech company even though it started out as an online fashion portal, and banking software maker Temenos, which stands to gain as banks recovering from the financial crisis start to invest again to replace outdated legacy systems.""We are still very bullish on the (tech) sector but we should assume that the returns we saw last year are probably unlikely to be matched this year because it’s got harder on that multiple side,"" said Morris-Eyton.A trader at a European bank said he remained positive on STMicro and Infineon despite recent caution around those names. ""The peak of the semiconductors cycle is close but it's not imminent,"" he said. He also backed IT services firms. ""Even though we are in a final phase of the cycle, there is an acceleration of activity,"" he said, citing  Cap Gemini  (PA:CAPP), Sopra Steria and Altran among house recommendations.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

55,"Dec 11, 2017 06:20PM ET",Atos offers to buy Gemalto for 4.3 billion euros to boost cyber security services,nan,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) - French technology consulting firm Atos (O:ATO) offered to buy  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) for 4.3 billion euros ($5.06 billion) on Monday to boost its cyber security services as states and big corporations seek to cope with a growing number of attacks on the Internet worldwide.The bid comes as Gemalto, the world's largest maker of chips found in mobile phones and credit cards, is under pressure after posting four profit warnings in a year and having missed a chance to strengthen its security business through a large acquisition.The combination would strengthen Atos in the burgeoning so-called Internet of Things (IoT) sector of internet-connected machinery and household devices able to collect and exchange data using embedded sensors and European payment services on top of digital security, it said.Atos said it delivered an offer to Gemalto's board on Nov. 28. Shortly after issuing the formal offer, Atos Chief Executive Thierry Breton said he had already received the backing of Gemalto's biggest shareholder, France's state-owned investment bank Bpifrance. ""I've met the main shareholders and Bpi in particular,"" Breton said in a call with reporters following the announcement of the unsolicited bid for Gemalto.""Bpi is not only favorable to this operation of European consolidation, but it also authorized me to tell you about it,"" he added. Bpifrance holds 8.51 percent of Gemalto's shares, according to the group's last annual report. Gemalto and Bpifrance were not immediately reachable for comment.STOCK PRESSUREDGemalto had to postpone to March 2018 the presentation the presentation of its next multiyear strategic plan, after several profit warnings notably caused by slowing demand for credit card chips.The group's shares have shed 38 percent so far this year compared with an increase of 24 percent for Atos. Since Breton took the helm of Atos in November 2008, the firm has multiplied its stock price by close to six times, outperforming French rival Capgemini (PA:CAPP) and U.S. companies Accenture (N:ACN) and  IBM  (N:IBM).Atos' revenue has more than doubled over the period to reach 11.7 billion euros in 2016, after having bought assets from Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), U.S. group Xerox (N:XRX) and France-based computer company Bull. Gemalto had sales of 3.2 billion euros in 2016.The all-cash bid reflects a price of 46 euros per Gemalto share, representing a 42 percent premium on the group's last closing price, Atos said in a statement. The bid would be financed by Atos' existing cash resources and debt, the company said without elaborating.Breton said that two banks had already given their approval for a potential loan.

108,"Jun 23, 2016 03:10AM ET",Rich Swiss bank clients seek refuge from negative rates: study,nan,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Wealthy bank clients in Switzerland are diverting more of their cash to investments such as hedge funds and private equity to counter negative interest rates, a report by French consultant Capgemini (PA:CAPP) said on Thursday.Capgemini's annual world wealth report found that high-net-worth individuals in Switzerland kept 21.4 percent of their assets in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of 2016, down from 28.2 percent a year earlier. These high-net-worth clients are defined by Capgemini as individuals with $1 million-plus to invest, ""Because clients are not receiving any interest, they're looking for alternative investment opportunities,"" said Tobias Wolf, senior manager at Capgemini Consulting.The Swiss National Bank has pushed interest rates to record lows since January 2015 in an effort to weaken the Swiss franc. It now charges banks 0.75 percent on some deposits.With the exception of Alternative Bank Switzerland, Swiss lenders have not yet passed on negative rates to retail customers, but some have introduced deposit charges for cash-heavy corporate, private and institutional clients.Switzerland's biggest bank, UBS (S:UBSG), could pass on negative rates to wealthy private customers or add new service fees to safeguard profitability and capital returns, its chief executive said last month.The Capgemini study also found that, for the first time, the Asia Pacific region had more high-net-worth individuals than North America.Asia Pacific, which many private banks are counting on to drive growth, had 5.1 million such individuals in 2015, compared with 4.8 million in North America. Capgemini also found that the growth in the number of high-net-worth individuals and their wealth slowed to 4.9 percent and 4 percent respectively, well off the pace of previous years.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

118,"Apr 13, 2016 01:50AM ET",JPMorgan cuts 5 percent of Asia wealth management jobs: source,nan,"By Saeed Azhar and Sumeet ChatterjeeSINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has cut 30 jobs, or 5 percent of its headcount, at its Asia wealth management business, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, as the U.S. bank sharpens its focus on tapping wealthier clients.The job cuts would affect the bank's Singapore and Hong Kong offices, the source said, declining to be identified because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the subject. JPMorgan said in a statement that Edwin Lim, market manager for North Asia high-networth clients, had left the firm. A spokeswoman declined to comment further on job cuts. The cuts highlight a decision by the bank to refocus on upper-end Asian clients with $10 million in investable surplus, known as ultra-high networth individuals, up from a $5-million threshold earlier, the source said.In March last year, JPMorgan said it had decided to position its Asia wealth management unit as one private bank serving both the rich and the super rich, aligning its business model with other regions.With 4.7 million individuals with $1 million in liquid financial assets, Asia-Pacific is the largest and fastest growing wealth region, according to  Cap Gemini  (PA:CAPP) and RBC.But some Western banks have recently retreated from the wealth management business in Asia due to rising costs, regulatory risks and competition.British lender  Barclays  (L:BARC) earlier this month agreed to sell its wealth and investment management business in Hong Kong and Singapore to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) (SI:OCBC).""At J.P. Morgan, we constantly review our coverage to ensure that clients are aligned with the advisors who are best suited to meet their needs,"" the JPMorgan spokeswoman said in the statement.""Our integrated team approach to service our clients will remain unchanged and fully covered,"" the statement said, adding the bank remained open to hiring more in the region to grow its wealth management business.JPMorgan's shift in strategy for its wealth management unit began a few months ago and saw the departure of several private bankers who were targeting the high-networth segment, typically with about $5 million liquidity, private banking sources said.Peter Flavel, the former JPMorgan chief executive of private wealth management at Asia Pacific, joined Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC's (L:RBS) Coutts & Co and Adam & Co. in February.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

120,"Apr 10, 2016 07:20PM ET",Tech start-ups snap at the heels of Asian private bankers,nan,"By Jeremy Wagstaff and Saeed AzharSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Scanning a bank statement into a computer may not sound particularly high-tech, but it's unsettling some of Asia's private bankers.By aggregating all the monthly statements mailed to high net worth individuals on the multiple accounts they hold at different institutions, Singapore start-up Mesitis offers clients a single window on their holdings.""There's a need for this,"" says Pooja Gurbani, a Singaporean in her 30s who handles tens of millions of dollars of family money. ""It makes us see more, it makes us more intelligent investors."" With 4.7 million high net worth individuals - typically those with $1 million in liquid financial assets - Asia-Pacific is the largest and fastest growing wealth region, according to  Cap Gemini  (PA:CAPP) and RBC.But its private banking industry is only slowly waking up to the demands of a new, tech-savvy generation of wealthy clients and family offices, creating opportunities for financial technology, or fintech, start-ups.Gurbani said she was so impressed with the Mesitis service that she ditched her private banker and even invested in the firm, one of a handful of start-ups across Asia looking to disrupt the traditional wealth management business.For sure, sending statements to a third party and viewing holdings online won't appeal to everyone, especially ultra high net worth individuals - those with at least $30 million of investable assets - and Mesitis says it is not regulated.DIGITAL INTEGRATIONFeeding paper statements into a scanner may seem low-tech, but it gets around the lack of application programming interfaces (APIs) that many banks and financial institutions in the United States offer to allow third-party access to data.That level of digital integration hasn't taken off in Asia, prompting regulators such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to prod banks to do more.""You don't really have a choice because we're already here,"" Mesitis' co-founder and CEO Tanmai Sharma told a recent banking event hosted by the MAS. ""This is do-able and absurdly easy.""Sharma's company is now running trials at three private banks to integrate its software into their systems, but he says most of his firm's business is directly with banks' clients.Private banks are cautiously taking note. Clients in Asia are digitally tuned-in and the region's billionaire wealth will overtake that of the U.S. within a decade, a UBS study predicts.UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, is evaluating Mesitis' Canopy service, Ketan Samani, chief digital officer at UBS Wealth Management APAC, told Reuters.Indeed, UBS and others such as  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) are building their own fintech teams. Inside a colonial-era building that once served as the British military headquarters in Singapore, UBS is lab-testing new technologies to serve its wealthy clients in Asia.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has a mobile app tailored for its Asia-Pacific private banking clients.Samani sees the main threat from so-called fintech disrupters in payments, lending and credit cards. ""All those are under attack now. Non-traditional players have come in and the barriers have lowered to some degree,"" he said.But UBS and other private banks hope their core advisory business - built around face-to-face meetings - will escape the onslaught. ""We are moving towards being paid for advice, with new products coming in regardless of the number of transactions the clients are making and so on,"" said Geoffroy De Ridder, operating head for UBS Wealth Management in Asia Pacific.CHIPPING AWAYOffering advice may not, however, be as safe as it looks.So-called 'robo-advisers' automate wealth advisory roles, calling into question the value of traditional banker/client meetings, and potentially threatening an important source of bank income.Some Asian bankers are dismissive. ""They're kind of just algorithms in the sky, they’re pretty dumb,"" said Neal Cross, chief innovation officer for DBS, a Singapore bank which spends close to $700 million a year on technology. He was speaking in December.Mesitis' Sharma, a former managing director at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), believes the opposite. He says start-ups will chip away at both businesses by aggregating customers' data and offering smarter insights on their investments.""Robo is a logical offshoot of the aggregation business we do,"" said Sharma. ""We have the data anyway, so using that data to make efficient investment portfolios is a logical next step.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

CACI and Leidos did not respond to requests for comment.CSC's North American public sector division offers IT and operations-related services to the U.S. Department of Defense and civil agencies of the federal government, as well as foreign, state and local government agencies. CSC estimated it would have revenues $4.1 billion for its 2015 fiscal year. CSC's U.S. public sector business is seen as attractive to potential buyers because of the high barriers to entry for competitors. The separation from the remaining division, global commercial, is anticipated by October. The second business, which provides information technology services and solutions partner for Fortune 1,000 companies and non-U.S. government clients, was expected to have $8.1 billion in revenue for 2015. The breakup of CSC, which has a market capitalization of close to $9.6 billion, follows multiple attempts by the Falls Church, Virginia-based company to sell it self over several years.Prior to its announcement of the break-up, CSC drew buyout interest from French consulting company  Cap Gemini  (PARIS:CAPP) SA, computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co and Canadian consulting firm CGI Group Inc, as well as private equity firms, Reuters previously reported.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

138,"Apr 27, 2015 12:31PM ET",French IT firm Cap Gemini to buy U.S. rival IGATE for $4 billion,nan,"By Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS (Reuters) -  Cap Gemini  SA (PA:CAPP), a French information technology services company, said it will buy U.S.-based rival IGATE Corp (O:IGTE) for $4 billion in a deal that would make North America into its biggest market and hand IGATE's founders a $1 billion windfall.Cap Gemini also raised its 2015 sales forecast on Monday in a statement that was pushed up to coincide with the announcement of the deal. Its shares climbed nearly 8 percent. IGATE, which has strength in the financial services sector, has grown quickly since its 1996 stock market listing. Cap Gemini said IGATE has been recording double-digit growth and a 19 percent operating margin. Its 2014 revenue was $1.3 billion.The acquisition would significantly bolster the French company's presence in North America. IGATE does about 80 percent of its business in North America, and would represent 30 percent of the combined group's estimated 2015 revenue of 12.5 billion euros ($13.58 billion).The deal would enhance earnings by 12 percent in 2016 and 16 percent in 2017, according to Cap Gemini. The combined group's operating margin would be above 10 percent.Cap Gemini, whose market capitalization was about 13 billion euros ($14 billion) at the close of business on Friday, said it would pay $48 a share for IGATE. The U.S. company's shares added 3.5 percent to $47.45 on Monday.54 PCT IGATE SHAREHOLDER BACKINGCap Gemini will financed the deal partly through about $1 billion of its own cash, along with an equity portion that will not exceed a 6 percent dilution of the French company's share capital. More than $2 billion would be financed through debt.Cap Gemini said it had the backing of shareholders representing 54 percent of IGATE's share capital. Ashok Trivedi and Sunil Wadhwani, the Indian-American co-founders and co-chairmen of IGATE, own 12.81 percent and 12.99 percent, respectively, of the shares and could collect more than $1 billion between them.With the acquisition, Cap Gemini would add new clients such as  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY).IGATE employs 33,000 people globally, with 75 percent of them in India. The combined company would have more than 100,000 employees there, or 48 percent of its workforce. In a separate statement, Cap Gemini said sales grew by 10.5 percent in the first quarter and raised its 2015 growth target to at least 5 percent from its previous forecast of between 3 percent and 5 percent. The deal will require various regulatory approvals, and was expected to close in the second half of this year.Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) advised IGATE while  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) advised Cap Gemini on the transaction.

140,"Apr 23, 2015 12:47PM ET",German engineers need software to head off technology firms,nan,"By Ludwig BurgerFRANKFURT (Reuters) - If customers of Germany's Harting Group, a maker of industrial plugs and sockets, want bespoke products, they can buy them -- if they're prepared to assemble them from a kit themselves. Volker Franke, the head of Harting's assembly systems and machine tools business, is working hard to change that. His team is developing an automated production line that takes orders online and makes plugs to a customer's individual specification.Harting is one of a growing number of German firms investing in software, fearing their excellence in mechanical precision and reliability -- the trademarks of ""Made in Germany"" valued by factory owners around the world -- will not be enough to guarantee them success for much longer.As computerized technology becomes an ever greater part of industrial processes, Internet companies are starting to eclipse low-cost Chinese manufacturers as German engineers' main worry.With the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) investing heavily in robotics and automated driving, the fear is engineers will be relegated to selling generic hardware, while software firms make it rich with the technology that makes the machinery smart.""Right now there are makers of factory equipment and those who buy, operate and look after it. Who guarantees that it stays that way?"" asked Franke during a Reuters visit to Harting's headquarters in Espelkamp, northwest Germany. ""It could be that somebody will squeeze their way between the two, telling the equipment user he won't have to bother about what type of machines to use any more. This service provider will be from the digital world,"" he said.Companies that can master vast amounts of data such as Google, SAP, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), EMC Corp (NYSE:EMC)'s cloud-computing division Pivotal and  Teradata  Corp (NYSE:TDC) could all open up the breach, industry analysts believe. Advisory firms such as  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and  Cap Gemini  (PARIS:CAPP) and software makers such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could also be winners from an industrial Internet revolution, potentially to the detriment of engineers.""Companies that provide database and analytical tools -- such as IT companies or system integrators -- could gather technical parameters in mechanical engineering regardless of the brand of the machine,"" said Michael Ruessmann, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group with a focus on information technology. INDUSTRIE 4.0The stakes are particularly high for Germany. Europe's biggest economy depends on manufacturing for a larger share of gross domestic product than any of its western European neighbors or the United States, with tens of thousands of family-owned businesses -- the so-called Mittelstand -- the bedrock of its export-driven success.The German government is alive to the danger. In 2013, it launched its ""Industrie 4.0"" initiative, backed by the top lobby groups in engineering, electronics and high-tech, to address issues such as worker skills, data transfer standards and data security.But so far it is larger firms leading the move to adapt, with 70 percent of German industry executives in a study commissioned by consultancy CSC saying they were not sufficiently informed about potential new business models.These involve, for example, developing algorithms for how best to run a production process and packaging them into universal factory services that feed on sensor-generated data such as vibration, temperature or power consumption.""I'm deeply concerned that there is still not enough awareness (in Germany) for the growing interconnectedness and the changes that result from it,"" said Volkmar Denner, chief executive at Robert Bosch GmbH, one of the world's largest automotive parts makers and a major player in factory equipment.German industrial gases firm Linde, which plans to hook up oxygen tanks to the Internet so they will trigger a replacement before they run empty, said big companies could show the way. ""The auto industry and large manufacturing firms are acting as pioneers while small and medium-sized companies are rather in a discovery phase, thinking about what is feasible and what isn't,"" Chief Executive Wolfgang Buechele said.Consultancies and technology firms are pitching to fill the gap in information and skills at factory equipment makers. The advisory arm of auditor PwC reckons about half of German industrial groups' investments in plant and equipment will be driven by ""Industrie 4.0"" over the next five years, equal to about 40 billion euros ($43 billion) per year.With a strong starting position and a tradition of collaboration and communication, the Mittelstand is well placed to adapt, according to Michael Ziesemer, president of German electronic hardware makers lobby group ZVEI.""The German industry is the equipment supplier to the factories of this world,"" he said. ""If we manage to stay ahead, there could be more jobs in Germany in the end.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

144,"Mar 27, 2015 01:01PM ET",New apps to help business get in step with mobile customers,nan,"By Eric AuchardFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nine months after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) began working together on building mobile apps for businesses, some of the first fruits are about to appear at UK pharmacy chain Boots, which has begun equipping store employees with iPads to serve shoppers in the aisles.These customer service apps are part of a bid by Boots to encourage consumers to pre-order cosmetics and toiletries online, similar to calling ahead for medical prescriptions, while turning its 2,500 retail outlets into convenient pick-up points.""These apps put all of Boots' inventory at (employees') fingertips,"" said Robin Phillps, who is in charge of digital and e-commerce business at the company, now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance. ""This makes it easier for them ... to interact with customers on their own terms.""Companies across dozens of different industries are now eyeing how these mobile business apps from Apple and IBM can hook up front-line staff to back-office systems and make them smarter in face-to-face dealings with customers in the field.Businesses which first invested heavily in apps for mobile shoppers have just begun to put customer-service employees on an equally mobile footing, Forrester Research said in a report this month on the phenomenon.With many companies' in-house technical staff struggling to keep pace with the ways their employees use mobile phones, Apple and IBM are part of a growing market for supplying business and government organizations with a new class of apps for employees on the move.Technology consultants Accenture,  Cap Gemini  (PARIS:CAPP) and Deloitte [DLTE.UL] are also top suppliers to this changing way of doing business, along with dozens of other service providers and hundreds of custom designer app firms.MAKING STAFF ""SMARTER""IBM says it now has more than 200 global companies gearing up to use mobile phone apps through its partnership with Apple. These include U.S. banking group Citi and Banorte of Mexico, Air Canada, and retailers  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) and Boots UK.The partnership has announced 14 app templates so far, which IBM then works with clients to customize with specific company data and analytics. Each app lets employees look up customer profiles and answer questions on the go rather than anchoring them to counter terminals as most businesses typically do.""We are trying to bring that same 'wow' factor, the same changes we have had in our personal lives, to our working lives,"" said Katharyn White, IBM's global sales and marketing lead for the IBM-Apple partnership.The goal is to create 100 business apps running on iPhones or iPads by the end of this year, White said. Companies pay a monthly subscription fee per device running the app, plus the costs of the secure iPhones or iPads running the software, as well as for services to hook them up to back-office systems.For the airline industry, these apps will let flight attendants help passengers rebook flights in mid-air. Financial service apps allow bankers, wealth advisors or insurance agents to make on-the-spot account decisions with clients in the field. Other Apple-IBM apps give police secure, instant access on iPhones to crime-scene maps, video feeds and suspect profiles.Besides design expertise for the apps themselves, Apple provides remote technical support for a company's own technology departments managing the apps. And as part of the deal IBM sells iPhones and iPads along with the business apps, a potentially important new revenue stream for Apple as big businesses begin to mobilize more of their workforces.For IBM, which has software and design teams developing the MobileFirst apps, the apps themselves also take corporate and government customers to a range of IBM services -- technical support, mobile device management, back-office software integration and cloud computing.BRINGING ONLINE WORLD TO STORESAt Boots UK the retailer plans to introduce the business apps in hundreds of pharmacies to employees equipped with 4,000 iPads it has purchased so far. Boots also plans to make Wi-Fi ubiquitous in its pharmacies, both for employees using the business apps and for shoppers on their phones.Currently 7.5 million shoppers visit Boots stores each week while 2.7 computer and phone users research and purchase goods via its online sites. About one-third of online shoppers, or around 1 million consumers, do so using mobile phones, so far. The aim is to get customers to order the bulk of their goods online and then pick them up the next morning at local pharmacies, Phillips said. Employee apps complement this mission with a means of interacting with in-store customers. Its Sales Assist app, which provides an internal version of the company's public e-ecommerce site, enables Boots employees to serve shoppers in the aisles and eventually they will also be able to take payments with a quick swipe of the customer's phone.""The direction we are moving is purchasing in the aisles,"" Phillips says, adding that the goal is to remove the check-out till as a barrier to buying.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

146,"Feb 24, 2015 10:01PM ET","Exclusive: Cap Gemini, Carlyle held talks to buy Computer Sciences - sources",nan,"By Mike Stone and Liana B. Baker(Reuters) - Technology consultant Computer Sciences Corp (NYSE:CSC) drew buyout interest from French consulting company Cap Gemini (PARIS:CAPP) SA and private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, according to people familiar with the matter.Talks between CSC and the consortium of Cap Gemini and Carlyle started late last year but have since fizzled, the sources said on Tuesday. It is unclear whether these talks will resume, they added.CSC, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, is now working with Royal Bank of Canada to review its options, the people said.The sources requested anonymity because the talks are confidential. Cap Gemini said it was not engaged in ongoing discussions regarding a transaction. CSC, Carlyle and Royal Bank of Canada declined to comment. Computer Sciences shares ended trading on Tuesday down 1.3 percent at $70.84Hedge fund Jana Partners LLC disclosed a 5.9 percent stake in CSC on Monday and said it would continue talks with the IT services and government contracting company about strategic alternatives and its board composition.CSC's customers include governments as well as commercial enterprises around the world. France's Cap Gemini would need an American partner such as Carlyle to purchase any part of CSC's business that cannot be owned by a non-U.S. entity for national security reasons. One of CSC's customers is the U.S. Department of Defense.CSC has been the subject of buyout interest over the years. One person close to a previous round of discussions, nearly 10 years ago, said talks fell apart because another party and a private equity firm that had ""partnered"" to buy CSC could not agree on how to divide the Falls Church, Virginia-based company.CSC's revenue has been on the decline this year, dropping 4.2 percent in the first nine months of its current fiscal year to $9.26 billion. CEO Mike Lawrie blamed the sales decline partly on ""execution missteps"" in a Feb 9 conference call. The company is in the midst of a cost-cutting campaign while also facing sequestration and budget pressures from the U.S. government.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

low on Friday, extending the previous day's sharp losses, with
investors anxious before key U.S. jobs figures after data this
week raised doubt about the strength of economic recovery. By 1033 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1.2 percent at
970.14 points, after losing 1.6 percent on Thursday to a
three-week closing low. The index, which has just posted its best quarterly gain in
nearly 10 years, was set for a third day of losses. ""There is a lot of negative in the background, which
suggests you don't want to be complacent about this being a
short-term correction,"" said Geoff Wilkinson, head of investment
research at Mint, in London. ""Clearly people are buying bonds, we have got through the
key 3.3 percent yield level in U.S. 10-year (Treasury), and
people are buying yen."" Banks, which have rallied 160 percent since March, were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture. KBC, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank
, Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 0.6-4.5 percent. ""The key thing ...  is whether we are going to get a turn in
financials. If they have another lurch lower, 2 or 3 percent, it
will move beyond a gradual pullback to a more significant
correction of 10 percent plus,"" Wilkinson said. British insurer Legal & General shed 5.5 percent, partly
reversing a four-day rally on the back of bid speculation. Commodity shares, which have also performed strongly in the
rally, were out of favour. Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group and Total
 dropped 0.4-0.8 percent. Among miners, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Lonmin, Xstrata,
Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0.9 percent to 4
percent. All eyes will be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls data for
September, due at 1230 GMT, for indications of the pace of the
recovery in the world's largest economy. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180,000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216,000 jobs in
August, while the unemployment rate was seen at 9.8 percent,
compared to a 9.7 percent rate the prior month. The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies as
investors squared positions ahead of the jobs data and a meeting
of Group of Seven finance chiefs over the weekend. International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said it was not yet time to withdraw government
economic stimulus because of rising unemployment and a
still-damagaed financial sector. The pan-European index, which slumped 45 percent last year,
has rallied 50 percent since hitting a floor in early March, and
is up 16.6 percent so far this year.  LOW RISK APPETITE The VDAX-NEW volatility index was up 5.1 percent after
hitting a four-week closing high on Thursday. The higher the
index, the lower is investors' appetite for risky assets. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.8 percent,
Germany's DAX fell 0.7 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 1.3
percent. U.S. stock index futures pointed to a softer start for Wall
Street. ""We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while,""
said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research, in Frankfrut. ""The third quarter performed pretty strongly. With the
beginning of the fourth quarter, we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest."" Technology shares also came under pressure, tracking
weakness from U.S. semiconductors after poor results by
technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture. TomTom, Alcatel-Lucent, ASML Holding, Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2.8-7.6 percent. Carlsberg sagged 5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded
the brewer to 'sell', but SABMiller added 1.5 percent, helped by
Cazenove's positive comments. Munich Re gained 1.2 percent after receiving a boost from
two broker price target upgrades.

Bank, Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 1.1 to 6.8 percent. But HSBC put on 0.6 percent, as traders said the bank was
the most defensive in the sector. Heavyweight commodity shares, which have also performed

 suffered their worst one-day fall in three months, while
Japan's Nikkei average fell 2.5 percent. ""Consumer expectations are now extremely stretched relative
to the dismal reality. This also occurred during the early 1990s
credit crunch,"" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a
note. ""Back then expectations also ran up far ahead of reality.
Interestingly, after the recession had ended in March 1991,
excessively optimistic expectations slumped three more times
until muddling reality caught up with excessive hope. Markets
still have too much hope."" European automakers were also weak after September U.S. auto
sales tumbled by 23 percent as showrooms emptied after the
government-funded boom from the ""cash for clunkers"" programme. Daimler, Renault, Peugeot, BMA and Volvo were off 0.4 to 2.8
percent, but Volkswagen advanced 0.8 percent. Alcatel-Lucent, ASML Holding, Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2.4 to 5.2 percent, leading the tech
sector lower. Carlsberg eased 4.5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded
the brewer to ""sell"" from ""hold"".

165,"Sep 10, 2009 12:48PM ET",Tech stocks nudge European stocks higher at close,nan," * FTSEurofirst 300 index closes up 0.1 percent * Technology stocks gain * Banks fall  By Joanne Frearson LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - European shares closed slightly
higher on Thursday in a choppy session, rising for the fifth
consecutive day, with gains in technology stocks overshadowing
losses in the banking sector. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares edged
up 0.48 points or 0.1 percent to 988.33 points, having traded
within a 14 point range reaching 993.85 at best. The index, which fell 45 percent in 2008, is up nearly 19
percent this year -- 53 percent above a record low in March. But, it is still down almost 15 percent from its level just
before the collapse of Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers a year
ago that accelerated the global credit crisis. ""I don't think there is an awful lot out there driving it.
It's just volatile trading in a general positive uptrend,"" said
Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank. Technology shares were among the major gainers. ASML, the
world's top maker of semiconductor lithography was up 2.2
percent after it increased its sales outlook, thanks to
improving operations in some chip markets. Nokia, Alcatel-Lucent, Infineon and ARM Holdings gained 0.5
to 3 percent. Software stocks were higher, with SAP up 2.7 percent after
Bill McDermott, president of SAP's global field operations, said
the company would stay vigilant on costs and added that SAP can
achieve a higher market share and higher profitability at the
same time. Autonomy and Cap Gemini were up 1.6 to 2.6 percent.  BANKS FALL Bank stocks took most points off the index. Banco Santander
, BNP Paribas, HSBC and Societe Generale were down 1 to 2.3
percent. General retailers were lower. Home Retail fell 6.7 percent
as investors took profits after Britain's biggest household
goods retailer reported better-than-expected second-quarter
sales at both its Argos and Homebase businesses. ""Home Retail and retailers in general have had a very good
run over the last few weeks and I think investors are finding
any excuse possible to take profits at the moment. That's what
appears to be happening with Home Retail,"" a trader at KBC Peel
Hunt says. Energy stocks fell as crude lost 0.5 percent. BP, Repsol and
Tullow Oil was down 0.5 to 1.2 percent. Mining stocks retreated as metal prices slipped. Copper was
down 1.8 percent, aluminium fell 1.8 percent and nickel lost 3.5
percent. Anglo American, Antofagasta, Eurasian Natural Resources
Corporation and Xstrata were down 0.3 to 3.2 percent. The Bank of England left interest rates at a record low of
0.5 percent for the sixth month running on Thursday and said it
would keep its 175 billion pound asset buying programme in
place.    Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 0.3
percent, Germany's DAX was up 0.4 percent and France's CAC 40
was down 0.01 percent.
