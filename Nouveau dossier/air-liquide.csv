Also on Monday, the EU signed off on Taiyo Nippon Sanso as a suitable buyer.Linde lined up a consortium of gases firm Messer and investor CVC (CVC.UL) in July as a buyer of its North and South American assets to allay U.S. antitrust concerns, but talks with the FTC later hit a snag, requiring more asset sales.The companies have until Jan. 29 next year to complete certain divestitures in the United States, and need to remain separate and independent companies until the majority of these deals are wrapped up, Linde added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

15,"Aug 22, 2018 07:05AM ET",Linde-Praxair try to save $83 billion merger after antitrust blow,nan,"By Alexander Hübner and Jörn PoltzMUNICH (Reuters) - Industrial gases giants Linde (DE:LIN1) and Praxair (N:PX) are in talks to try to salvage their $83 billion merger after U.S. competition regulators demanded they sell assets that generate more than $4.3 billion in sales.Linde said on Wednesday the divestments were expected to reach a level that would allow either party to abandon the deal, although the German company added that talks continued with both Praxair and regulators.Analysts said they still expected the deal to go ahead, though they cautioned the asset sales could make the deal less attractive and/or make synergy targets harder to achieve. Linde and U.S.-based Praxair agreed an all-share merger in principle in December 2016, aiming to create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP), which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas (NYSE:ARG).The companies agreed that if antitrust regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in sales, or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty.Linde said on Wednesday it expected the revenue threshold for divestment commitments to be exceeded, but didn't say by how much and did not mention the EBITDA hurdle. It had previously warned this was very likely to happen.""Linde and Praxair remain in constructive dialogue with each other and the regulators on how to satisfy their requirements,"" Linde said.Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asked for more assets to be sold than previously anticipated and also said it wanted prospective buyers of these assets to meet certain other requirements.Bids for major U.S. firms have had mixed fortunes recently.U.S. President Donald Trump in March blocked Singapore-based microchip maker Broadcom's (O:AVGO) $117 billion takeover proposal for Qualcomm (O:QCOM) on national security grounds. The $63 billion takeover of seeds maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) by Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn), meanwhile, went through after 7.6 billion euros worth of disposals. 'HUGE BLOW'A source familiar with Linde's thinking said both companies were doing everything they could to see the deal through, but they could not lose track of the targeted $1.2 billion in annual synergies without perhaps putting shareholders' support at risk.Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Michael Schaefer said he expected Linde and Praxair to seek to address the FTC's demands.""The fact that they remain in constructive talks signals to us that there is still readiness on both sides to stay the course"", he said.Linde shares were down 1.3 percent at 0915 GMT, paring initial losses of 2.3 percent.The German group last month lined up a consortium of gases firm Messer and investor CVC as a buyer of North and South American assets to allay antitrust concerns, while Praxair's European gases business will be sold to Japanese rival  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091).The source said U.S. regulators had some qualms about the proposed buyer of the former block of assets, which Linde has been trying to address.While the European Commission gave its go-ahead this week, regulators in the United States, China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and Chile have yet to decide.Arne Rautenberg, a fund manager at Frankfurt-based Union Investment, this week said he expected the deal to be salvaged, but added Linde might have to shed its high-margin on-site business in the United States, an operator of gas production facilities near petrochemical and steel plants, which would be a ""huge blow"".The regulatory challenge is a setback for Linde Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who has been a driving force for the deal and had to reshuffle management following the departure of the company's chief executive and finance chief.The companies face an Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules.The time pressure would put Linde and Praxair in a weak position when negotiating a price with prospective buyers of the assets, analysts have said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The companies' industrial gases such as oxygen and helium are used in hospitals, MRI scanners and steel production.The European Commission said the companies' pledge to sell assets to reinforce a Japanese rival in Europe and other concessions addressed its concerns that the deal may lead to price hikes and hurt competition, confirming a Reuters story on July 12.""With this decision, we make sure that the merger of Praxair and Linde will not result in further concentration in Europe and that customers will continue to benefit from competition in these markets,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.The EU watchdog said Praxair will sell its entire gas business in the 28-country bloc, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. It will also transfer its stake in an Italian joint venture in central and eastern Europe to partner Flow Fin. The companies will also sell additional helium sourcing contracts to one or more buyers.Praxair has already done a deal to sell its industrial gases businesses in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain to  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091) for 5 billion euros.The companies however are facing more onerous demands from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which wants more asset sales, possibly exceeding the companies' agreed threshold, and wants the buyers to meet certain requirements.Last month, Linde said it was in advanced talks to sell a majority of its gases business in North America and certain Linde and Praxair assets in South America to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Laurence Alexander, an analyst at brokerage Jefferies, said the merger parties would now only be able to get a relatively low price for additional divestments, but put the probability of the deal closing at more than 85 percent.Reuters reported last month that the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth antitrust review and following the agreed sale of Praxair's European gases business to Japanese rival  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091).In addition, Linde has agreed to sell North and South American assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC in a deal that will raise around $3.3 billion.

Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.5 percent.A negative open on Wall Street also comforted traders to stick to a risk-off mode until the close.Shares in Heineken (AS:HEIO) tumbled 6.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after the world's second largest beer maker reported weaker than expected first-half earnings and cut its full-year margin guidance.""Heineken’s first-half EPS missed expectations due to the consolidation of Kirin Brasil, adverse currency effects and higher input costs,"" Liberum analysts said in a note.France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) fell 2.5 percent to the bottom of the CAC 40 (FCHI) after its first-half operating income proved disappointing.Another faller after earnings was  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG), which declined 2 percent after the world's largest maker of medical-imaging gear reported a 10 percent slump in net profit, driven down by a strong dollar.Its parent company Siemens (DE:SIEGn) also fell 0.4 percent, one of the biggest weights among industrials stocks.Several companies however delivered positive results, including German industrial machinery group GEA (DE:G1AG), which rose 4.5 percent to a three-month high after it reported.""GEA Group’s second-quarter figures are characterized by better than (expected) order intake, partially wiping out the 1Q18 slump, solid sales growth and operating earnings surpassing the 2Q17 level and expectations,"" Baader Helvea analysts said.British bookmaker GVC (L:GVC), which owns the  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral brands, climbed 5.4 percent to a record high after announcing it had sealed a joint venture with MGM Resorts (N:MGM) to set up an online betting platform in the United States.Shore Capital analyst Greg Johnson said U.S. sports betting could grow to be a $20 billion market, and saw a 10 percent market share as potentially generating value of 270p per share for GVC.""A tie-up with MGM significantly increases the chances of achieving such a market position with a lower risk profile.""

They remain, however, the worst-performing sector year-to-date.After visiting clients, Citi analysts said U.S. investors remain underweight on EU banks but had more interest in buying them than on any of their recent marketing trips. Overall, MSCI Europe earnings are expected to grow 8.4 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, Thomson Reuters data shows. Earnings growth for the index is also being revised up for 2018 and 2019.But Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts say the rate of positive earnings surprises is trailing the historical average thus far in Q2.

""We are taking a constructive approach to address regulatory concerns with the merger in the European Economic Area,"" Praxair CEO Steve Angel said in a statement on Thursday. Linde shares rose 4.2 percent after the Taiyo Nippon Sanso deal was announced, and were among top gainers on the DAX index of leading German shares. Taiyo Nippon Sanso will pay 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) for the Praxair European assets, which generated annual sales of approximately 1.3 billion euros in 2017, in a move aimed at boosting its global competitiveness.""With this acquisition, we are seizing a unique opportunity to enter the European market and establish a truly global footprint through the purchase of highly attractive assets in all the key geographies in the European Union,"" Taiyo Nippon Sanso President CEO Yujiro Ichihara said.Sources previously told Reuters that Taiyo Nippon Sanso would likely buy the European assets that the two groups were trying to unload to satisfy regulators. Private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP was in the running to buy their U.S. assets worth about $3.3 billion, they said.Linde said in a statement that more disposals were planned in a bid to complete the Praxair merger this year.""Linde and Praxair are in discussions with the competent authorities and in negotiations with potential bidders with the objective of completing the business combination in the second half of 2018,"" it said in a statement on Thursday.A combined Linde and Praxair would have the size to overtake France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) SA in the supply of gases such as oxygen and helium to industries worldwide.Praxair said the assets to be sold include its industrial gases businesses in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Britain, and include approximately 2,500 employees.Taiyo Nippon Sanso said the deal depends on the planned Praxair-Linde merger going through.It said it would pay for the acquisition with cash on hand and loans, and had no plans to conduct equity financing. Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities acted as financial advisors to Praxair and McDermott Will & Emery UK LLP as legal advisors.

Those who were outbid have been given the opportunity to improve their offers in case talks with Carlyle and Taiyo collapse, two sources said.Price is not the only discussion point.As Reuters reported earlier this month, the sellers specifically sought strategic buyers for Praxair's European operations to help win approval by antitrust regulators.The European Commission, which decides on antitrust approval, typically prefers peer-to-peer mergers that create more globally competitive businesses.A combined Linde and Praxair would have the size to overtake France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) in the supply of gases such as oxygen and helium to industries worldwide.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

29,"Mar 08, 2018 11:50AM ET","Linde, Praxair expect bids for planned divestitures this month: sources",nan,"By Arno Schuetze and Foo Yun CheeFRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Gases groups  Linde  (DE:LING) and Praxair (N:PX) are pressing ahead with divestitures to facilitate their planned $85 billion merger and have asked potential buyers to present first-round bids this month, people close to the matter said.The exact size of asset sales has not yet been finalised in negotiations with antitrust regulators, said Linde Chief Executive Aldo Belloni after the company on Thursday posted a 2.8 percent rise in 2017 operating profit.But broad lines have become clear: Linde and Praxair are planning to divest assets with about $750-800 million in combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the sources said, adding they expect them to sell at an enterprise value of 10-12 times that. Peers such as  Air Liquide  and Air Products trade at 11-12 times their expected core earnings, while Praxair trades at 13.7 times and Linde at 9.5 times. Finding buyers for the assets would smoothen the regulatory path to clearance for the merger. It would follow, in a different blockbuster deal, Bayer (DE:BAYGN) agreeing to large divestitures to peer BASF to get an antitrust nod.The Linde and Praxair assets up for sale are two-thirds based in Europe with the remainder in the United States. Industrial gases are driven to customers usually within a 100 to 250-mile radius of production facilities, and regulators therefore examine regional rather than national markets in their reviews.In a bid to appeal to regulators and to attract a broad range of suitors, the European assets have been split into two alternative bundles, only one of which would be sold, the sources said.One package comprises Praxair assets in various parts of Europe, while a second package combines Linde assets in Spain and Portugal as well as some additional European Praxair assets, they added.Several buyout groups have been working on their bids, based on information packages that Linde and Praxair sent out last month.CVC, which has tied up with gases group Messer, is expected to bid for all assets on offer, as are Carlyle (O:CG), KKR (N:KKR) and Onex (TO:ONEX), the sources said, adding that some investors were still in talks to tie up with gases groups.Regulators have in the past blocked divestitures of assets to private equity, citing a lack of industrial clout.Some large peers, however, face potential antitrust concerns on their own and Linde peers such as Air Liquide (PA:AIRP), Air Products (N:APD) and Taiyo Nippon Sanso (T:4091) are expected to make offers only for individual parts of the portfolio. Linde and Praxair have asked for first-round bids to be handed in by the end of March. But people close to the matter said the deadline may be delayed as some bidders have asked for more detailed financial information before submitting bids.Linde said last month that divestments would be larger than initially planned. However, the company stressed on Thursday that a pain threshold would not be breached. The two companies had said last year that either party could walk away or seek to renegotiate the merger agreement if divestitures reach more than 3.7 billion euros in total revenues or 1.1 billion euros in combined core earnings (EBITDA).Praxair and the potential suitors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

33,"Oct 26, 2017 02:13AM ET",Hydrogen fuel-cell car push 'dumb'? Toyota makes a case for the Mirai,nan,"By Norihiko ShirouzuTOKYO (Reuters) - Having invested heavily in hydrogen, a technology derided by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief Elon Musk as ""incredibly dumb"", Toyota Motor Corp is making a renewed push for fuel cell cars to fill a role in a future dominated by electric battery vehicles.Japan's biggest automaker believes both technologies – all-electric battery cars like the Tesla Model X on one hand and Toyota’s hydrogen Mirai on the other - will be needed to fully usurp gasoline cars. ""We don’t really see an adversary ‘zero-sum’ relationship between the EV (electric vehicle) and the hydrogen car,"" Toyota chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada told Reuters ahead of the Tokyo auto show. ""We're not about to give up on hydrogen electric fuel-cell technology at all."" Toyota began pitching its fuel-cell car as a mainstream gasoline car alternative in 2014 when it launched the Mirai with a price tag of 7.24 million yen - almost $70,000 at the time. The car has since been launched in the United States and other countries around the world. But initial excitement has faded as major markets including China and Europe have tilted heavily toward electric vehicles.Just 4,300 Mirais have been sold, compared to around 4 million units of the Prius, Toyota's blockbuster hybrid that ushered in the age of the EV.Uchiyamada, who is known as the “father of the Prius"", says Toyota isn’t anti-EV and is investing heavily in technologies such all solid-state lithium-ion batteries to make them more desirable.But it also sees some advantages for hydrogen cars, which are propelled by electricity generated by fuel cells. One major issue facing EVs is the length of time they take to charge - up to 18 hours in some cases - and a problem being amplified as automakers pack in more batteries to extend range.Rapid charging technology is helping to solve this issue. But a 30- to 40-minute wait is still too long for many ordinary drivers with busy lives, says Yoshikazu Tanaka, the chief engineer in charge of Toyota's Mirai.What’s worse, rapid charging when used too often compromises battery life significantly, he and other engineers say.While a hydrogen car can refuel in under five minutes, the high cost of the technology and a lack of refuelling stations is a problem, something Toyota has been focused on addressing. The company has joined forces in Japan with rivals Nissan Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, and with energy companies such as JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy to build a network of refuelling stations that now totals 91. Tanaka also wants to significantly extend the car's driving range to compensate for the lack of fuelling stations.While still at the concept stage, Tanaka wants to raise the “practical driving range” of the Mirai to about 500 km (310 miles) from the current 350-400 km (190-250 miles). A fuel cell car's practical range usually dips to 65-70 percent of its ""sticker"" range - 650 km for the Mirai - because drivers often use air-conditioning and accelerate with abandon.Making the fuel cell system more efficient and trying to gain more propulsion power from a given amount of hydrogen will be key, Tanaka said. He also wants to package the vehicle more efficiently to gain more storage space for larger fuel tanks. CHINA HOPESToyota says one of the most promising markets for hydrogen cars is China – a key advocate of electric cars but one which is beginning to embrace fuel-cell technology as well.Last month, Shanghai announced plans to promote development of fuel-cell vehicles by adding hydrogen refueling stations, subsidizing companies developing fuel-cell technologies and setting up R&D facilities. The city’s goal is to put 20,000 hydrogen fuel-cell passenger vehicles and 10,000 commercial vehicles on the road by 2025.""Chinese policymakers visit us and we visit them frequently” to discuss Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell technology, says Katsuhiko Hirose, a green tech engineer at Toyota. Toyota was set to test hydrogen fuel-cell cars in China this month as part of an effort to determine the feasibility of selling the Mirai there.But it's not all just about cars. In an effort to encourage other industries to use hydrogen, Toyota and  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) S.A. helped set up the Hydrogen Council, a global lobby launched in January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.With 27 members including automakers Audi, BMW, Daimler, Honda, Hyundai, and energy companies such as Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total, the Hydrogen Council has lobbying policymakers and investors on hydrogen.The council's main argument is that electricity supplies can be limited and unstable in high demand. That's because power grids have small buffers as electricity cannot be stored easily and transported. Large-scale adoption of hydrogen can solve that issue, said Toyota's Uchiyamada, who is also co-chair of the Hydrogen Council. Electricity generated during the night, which usually goes to waste when unused, and electricity generated by solar and windmills can be stored and easily transported as liquid hydrogen, much like gasoline.“Elon Musk is right - it’s better to charge the electric car directly by plugging in,” said Tanaka. But hydrogen has a place as a viable alternative to gasoline, he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Angel and Linde CEO Aldo Belloni told Reuters they would at once head off on a roadshow to sell the merits of the deal. Linde needs 75 percent of shareholders to tender their shares to the new company, while Praxair needs a simple majority vote at a shareholder meeting.Executives said they were prepared to make the divestments needed to satisfy anti-trust regulators in 25 countries, particularly in the United States, but had set a ""pain threshold"" beyond which the deal might no longer make sense.Angel said the merger agreement set these thresholds at $3.7 billion in sales or $1.1 billion in core earnings (EBITDA).

""The 75 percent is not trivial.""$100 BILLION TARGETLinde estimates that individual retail investors own about 15 percent of its shares, while 10-13 percent may be held by index-tracker funds, some of whose rules would forbid them from tendering until acceptance reaches a certain level.Tracking down retail investors will be tough, Reitzle said.

The stock was trading up 1.9 percent at $134.83 by 1906 GMT.The all-share merger of equals, which still has to be approved by a majority of Praxair's shareholders, represents a triumph for Linde's Wolfgang Reitzle, a former chief executive who returned as chairman to seal the deal.Linde's shareholders will not vote on the deal but 75 percent must tender their shares to the new company for the deal to go through.Reitzle, who effectively discarded Linde's former CEO and finance chief to push through the merger after a failed attempt last year, was spared from having to use his casting vote as chairman when labour opposition crumbled at the last minute - as reported by Reuters on Wednesday.Labour delegates, who enjoy equal representation with shareholder delegates under German law on Linde's supervisory board, had threatened to scupper the deal, but in the end were divided by German job guarantees conditional on the merger.Linde's supervisory board voted by six to five in favor of the merger, with one labour representative abstaining, four sources familiar with the matter said.The new holding company will be incorporated in Ireland - where workers do not have the co-determination rights that they do in Germany over company strategy. Most governance activities including board meetings will take place in Britain.The companies raised their cost-savings target from the merger to $1.2 billion from $1 billion within three years - including efficiency programs already initiated.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018, the two companies said.Trade union IG BCE criticized Linde's management for not having more actively sought a consensus with labour, as is the norm in Germany. ""It is regrettable that the capital side did not take us up on our offer of talks,"" a spokesman said.Matthias Machnig, secretary of state in Germany's economy ministry, said: ""An opportunity to win the acceptance of workers for the planned merger was unfortunately missed with today's decision in the supervisory board.""Veteran dealmaker Reitzle, who was the architect of Linde's 8 billion-pound ($10 billion) agreement to take over Britain's BOC in 2006 and re-engineered the $50 billion Lafarge-Holcim (S:LHN) building materials merger in 2015, had repeatedly said he was reluctant to use his casting vote to force the merger.The 68-year-old, a highly sought-after executive in Germany who twice narrowly missed becoming CEO of luxury carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG), will become chairman of the merged company, while Praxair CEO Steve Angel will be chief executive.Linde shareholders will be offered 1.54 shares in the new company for every Linde share they hold, while Praxair shareholders will be offered one for one - leading to a roughly 50:50 ownership split.Linde and Praxair's CEOs will hold a news conference at 0900 GMT on Friday in Munich.(This version of the story corrects to make clear the majority of Praxair, Linde shareholders that have to accept deal in paragraphs 4 and 5)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Such votes on mergers are customary in Germany and are an opportunity for shareholders to express confidence in their leadership. But such votes do not free individuals from liability for their actions.Many investment funds from the United States and Britain follow the recommendations of advisory firms such as Ivox Glass Lewis at shareholder meetings.Fund manager Ingo Speich from Union Investment, one of Linde's top 15 investors, said that he would not ratify the moves by the company's management.""We do not call the industrial logic of the merger into question. But we criticize deficits in corporate governance and capital markets communication,"" he told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. ""(Chairman) Wolfgang Reitzle seems to be the driving force of the merger. But he acts in an intransparent way. We miss a clear distinction of the roles of management and supervisors,"" he added.The two companies had hoped to have a plan in place before Linde's annual shareholder meeting on May 10. But the deal has fallen behind schedule over the Linde management's inability to strike a deal with the employees.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

52,"Mar 30, 2017 10:44AM ET",Unions threaten to scupper Linde-Praxair merger,nan,"By Georgina Prodhan and Jens HackFRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) -  Linde  (DE:LING) labor representatives will vote against the German industrial gases group's planned $65 billion merger with U.S. rival Praxair (N:PX), the head of the German works council told Reuters on Thursday, in a move that could scupper the deal.The merger would entail significant job losses to achieve the promised $1 billion of synergies, with Linde bearing the brunt, while workers would lose their influence on strategy with the headquarters set to move from Germany, Gernot Hahl said.Linde and Praxair are racing to finalize a deal by Linde's annual shareholder meeting on May 10, after agreeing a non-binding term sheet in December. It would then have to be approved by the boards of both companies.""Our position in the supervisory board is: No, we will not approve the merger,"" Hahl said by phone.Linde's supervisory board, half of which is made up of labor representatives, voted unanimously in favor of the intention to merge in December, in exchange for job guarantees through 2021 for Linde's 8,000 German workers.Linde had until now characterized negotiations with its workers as constructive. ""The negotiations with Praxair are proceeding as planned,"" a Linde spokesman said on Thursday. He declined to comment on labor relations.After a meeting with Linde executives last week, the company's European works council sent a letter to staff saying it had become obvious the merger would lead to significant job losses in European countries outside Germany. The company employs several thousand people elsewhere on the continent. ""The European Works Council members and the workforce will therefore vigorously oppose the planned merger with Praxair,"" said the letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday.Other labor representatives said on Thursday they had previously only agreed to an ""examination with an open outcome"".""We are against it,"" said trade union IG Metall. ""We think nothing of the merger.""Workers representatives also secured the backing of the number two official in Germany's economy ministry.""Such a planned merger needs the acceptance of the labor side. This clearly does not currently exist. The economic rationale of such a project has also not been convincingly put forward, in my opinion,"" state secretary Matthias Machnig wrote.One person close to the negotiations told Reuters it was unclear whether the companies could offer further concessions to appease workers and clinch the deal.The merger is designed to create an industry leader with a combined market value of $65 billion and revenue of $29 billion that would overtake France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) and reunite a global Linde group split by the First World War a century ago.It is the second attempt by the two companies to agree a deal. Previous talks ran aground last September over where to locate key activities and who would run the business, resulting in the departure of Linde's two top executives.CASTING VOTE""The probability that the deal will still go through is still greater than 50 percent in our view, but has clearly decreased,"" wrote Equinet analyst Knud Hinkel, who has an ""accumulate"" recommendation on Linde stock.""If the deal actually collapsed, the share would suffer in the short term. In the long term, Linde could be better off without the merger.""Linde shares were up 0.2 percent at 1308 GMT, broadly in line with the German blue-chip DAX (GDAXI). The merger plan envisions a combined holding company being headquartered in Europe, but not Germany - probably Ireland, the Netherlands or Britain. These countries do not offer workers the same rights over strategy that Germany does.Linde Chief Executive Aldo Belloni said earlier this month he would not push through a deal against the will of workers, but was confident of winning them over. Linde's supervisory board will meet next Thursday, but will not yet vote on the matter.If the eventual vote is tied, Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, the driving force behind the merger, will have a casting vote. ""The works council feels it is being pushed into something,"" said an adviser to the labor side, who asked not to be named because his advice is confidential. ""If the capital side wants it, then Reitzle will have to use his casting vote, if they're so convinced.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The merger is designed to create a market leader that will overtake France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) and reunite a global Linde group split by the First World War a century ago. Opposition from trade unions could slow or even scupper a deal. Linde's 8,000 German staff have secured job guarantees until 2021 but fear the combined company will adopt the leaner structures of the more profitable Praxair.""It would be bad, of course,"" Belloni said when asked at a news conference whether he would push through a deal regardless. ""We have had to take a very defensive position but we will become more proactive and communicative.""Around 200 people including external advisers are working on the planned merger, according to a source familiar with the matter. Six working groups are addressing various issues, with divestitures and cartel law the thorniest, Belloni said.He said a location for a holding company for the merged entity had yet to be decided between Ireland, Amsterdam and London and would depend on questions including taxation, work permits, ease of reach from the United States and Germany and working language of the new company.REUNIFICATIONBelloni was speaking after Linde reported flat 2016 revenue from continuing operations of 16.9 billion euros ($17.8 billion) and a 3 percent rise in operating profit lifted by its gases and healthcare units, within its target range.Linde said it aimed for flat to 7 percent higher operating profit this year helped by cost cuts, and sales that could rise or fall by as much as 3 percent.""Given the absence of any strategic or merger related updates, we think the results, despite the beat in gases, will prove immaterial for the share price today,"" wrote UBS analyst Geoff Haire, who rates Linde ""neutral"".Linde shares touched both the top and the bottom of the German blue-chip DAX  during the course of Thursday morning. By 1136 GMT, they traded down 0.4 percent, broadly in line with the DAX.Munich-based Linde, which was founded in 1879 to develop mechanical refrigeration systems, had to stop U.S. trading after the United States joined the First World War in 1917, and sold its U.S. unit to Union Carbide.In the wake of the deadly Bhopal disaster at one of its pesticides plants in 1984, Union Carbide sold off assets including Linde's U.S. healthcare unit, Lincare, and spun off the industrial gases business it had acquired from Linde, now named Praxair.Linde bought back Lincare in 2012.Union Carbide is now part of  Dow Chemical  (N:DOW).($1 = 0.9493 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""In this context, we are convinced that the unique contribution that hydrogen solutions offer needs to be strongly reaffirmed now,"" the participants, including the chiefs of oil firms  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), Patrick Pouyanne and Ben van Beurden, said in a statement.The declaration was also signed by the CEOs of car makers BMW, Daimler, Honda, Hyundai, Kawasaki and Toyota as well as miner  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and energy and engineering firms Engie, Linde and  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP). Hydrogen does not release any CO2 at the point of use and its technologies and products have progressed significantly, the firms said in a statement. They aim to accelerate investment in developing and commercializing the hydrogen sector, currently amounting to just 1.4 billion euros a year - compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars invested annually by the oil sector.""We need governments to back hydrogen with actions of their own - for example through large scale infrastructure investment schemes,"" the statement quoted the head of Air Liquide Benoit Potier as saying. ""We are not trying to bring hydrogen only to cars or trains. We are trying to bring a systemic approach. Hydrogen can generate power, produce heat and it is close to the chemical industry. And it is the most abundant element in the universe,"" Potier told a news conference.The head of oil major Shell Ben van Beurden said that despite starting a hydrogen business 20 years ago, his firm today had only had five hydrogen refueling stations in Germany and three in California.""You need a coordinated approach to make it work.

Linde shares dropped 7 percent to 138 euros, below the price at which they were trading just before news of the talks emerged last month.""While the strategic rationale of a merger has been principally confirmed, discussions about details, specifically about governance aspects, did not result in a mutual understanding,"" Linde said in a statement.A top 10 shareholder who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media said it was disappointing that the deal had fallen through but he could understand the reasons and Linde was a strong company that could stand alone.""It's not a situation where the company is in danger,"" he said, adding that Linde could offer other measures such as share buybacks to support the stock price. His firm had not been consulted about the mooted merger, he added.Asked about other possible combinations of Linde with a competitor, he mentioned U.S.-based Air Products (N:APD) or China's  Yingde Gases  Group (HK:2168) as possible partners, but added: ""There aren't many options any more.""France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) is still digesting its $13 billion acquisition of U.S. rival Airgas (NYSE:ARG), which it completed in May. Any quick move by Air Products would be seen by Linde as too opportunistic, one banker said.The industrial gases sector is already strongly consolidated, as slower economic growth has weakened demand in the manufacturing, metals and energy sectors, putting pressure on smaller players.A Linde-Praxair deal would have had a good chance of passing anti-trust regulation in the United States, analysts believed, with Linde's strong position in healthcare complemented by Praxair's focus on industry.Munich-based Linde supplies gases to hospitals and patients with respiratory disorders in North America, as well as industrial gases worldwide, while Danbury, Connecticut-based Praxair focuses on industrial on-site production.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"Aug 16, 2016 07:51PM ET",Praxair and Linde's merger would face major antitrust hurdles,nan,"By Diane Bartz(Reuters) - Praxair (NYSE:PX) Inc's contemplated merger with  Linde  AG (DE:LING) would cut the number of global industrial gas suppliers to three from four, posing antitrust challenges and drawing scrutiny from regulators wary of more mega deals.Antitrust experts said the companies, which announced they were in early-stage talks on Tuesday, would likely have to agree to divestitures to create the world's largest industrial gas company with a market value of more than $60 billion.""It does strike me as a deal that will prompt serious antitrust scrutiny. Antitrust enforcers will want to look at submarkets,"" said Seth Bloom, formerly of the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and now in private practice.Antitrust authorities have been flexing muscle regarding transformative mergers. Deals they have challenged include Anthem’s $45 billion purchase of Cigna (NYSE:CI), Aetna’s $33 billion acquisition of Humana (NYSE:HUM), and U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co's $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc.Consolidation in industrial gases, including  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) SA's $13 billion acquisition of Airgas (NYSE:ARG) in May, has left Air Liquide, Linde, Praxair and Air Products and Chemicals Inc (NYSE:APD) providing most of the oxygen, nitrogen, argon and other gases to industries ranging from oil companies to drugmakers.Air Liquide has 29 percent of the U.S. industrial gas market, Praxair has 21 percent, Linde has 15 percent and Air Products has 14 percent, according to the most recent annual data from industry news provider gasworld Business Intelligence. A merger of Praxair and Linde would create a sector leader with 36 percent of the U.S. market.The story is similar in Europe, where Air Liquide has 32 percent of the market, Linde has 30 percent, Air Products has 13 percent and Praxair has 7 percent, according to gasworld.Such market shares would give regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pause, antitrust experts said. Praxair and Linde will likely have to review their business with regulators market by market, in regions as small as one metropolitan area, experts said.""There will be a settlement offer, and the question will be whether the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) thinks it's enough,"" said Ethan Glass of the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan LLP, who argued for the U.S. Department of Justice as it sought to stop Electrolux AB from buying  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's appliance business.Air Liquide's acquisition of Airgas offers some insight into the scrutiny to be expected. When the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reviewed the deal, it required a divestiture of assets to preserve competition for dry ice in the San Francisco Bay area.Adding to the uncertainty are questions over the FTC's composition next year. The final decision on antitrust clearance will likely be made by the next administration, since a new U.S. president will take office in January and a major antitrust review can last a year.The FTC, which normally has five commissioners, currently has three: two Democrats and a Republican."

One person had said Praxair was considering a takeover of Linde, while two other sources said Linde wanted a merger of equals.One of the sources said a share swap was one possible structure of a deal but that talks were still very preliminary.""A merger would be good for both companies, and for the sector as a whole,"" said Christopher Schaefer, a fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder of Linde.Shares in Linde were up 9.2 percent at 152.15 euros, an eight-month high, by 1346 GMT, making them the top gainer on Germany's blue-chip index (GDAXI), which was down 0.7 percent. Praxair was 4.7 percent higher at $123.58.Linde has a market value of around 28 billion euros ($31.6 billion), compared with about $33.7 billion for Praxair.Representatives for Danbury, Connecticut-based Praxair did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Munich, Germany-based Linde declined to comment.Analysts said talks may have been spurred by French Air Liquide's (PA:AIRP) acquisition of smaller U.S. peer  Airgas Inc  (NYSE:ARG) for $10.3 billion this year, making the world's leading industrial gases group a strong second player in North America behind Praxair.Union Investment's Schaefer said the two companies could be forced to sell some assets to win regulatory approval of a merger, for instance in Brazil, Germany and Canada.""But not so much that it would hurt the merger partners,"" he added.Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said overlaps in the rest of the world could help generate synergies of up to 800 million euros in a merger.Jefferies analysts said they estimated that Praxair could pay a 26 percent premium over Linde's market value to gain control of it and still achieve an 8 percent return on invested capital in the full year and improve its free cash flow per share by $1.70.Perella Weinberg is advising Linde, while  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), among others, is working for Praxair, sources said.($1 = 0.8865 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

BakerRIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - For one split second, Michael Phelps' dream of a 21st gold medal turned into a nightmare for his swimwear maker, Aqua Sphere.Phelps' self-branded ""MP"" cap split in half as he pulled it over his head in front of a global TV audience at the Rio Games on Tuesday night, just as he prepared to swim the anchor leg of the 4x200 meter freestyle relay.After a moment of panic, Phelps turned to teammate Conor Dwyer who came to the rescue with his own cap - though Dwyer, who is sponsored by Speedo, saved the swimming super star's blushes by inverting the cap to hide the rival logo.""Certainly not a moment you dream about,"" said Todd Mitchell, business line manager of Aqua Sphere, a division of Aqua Lung that is part of French group  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) SA.""There's a reality that the caps are made out of silicone. Those things do happen,"" Mitchell said at the Rio Games.Phelps left Speedo after the 2012 London Games and has been using a swim kit designed for him by Aqua Sphere, a virtual unknown in swim racing, which made its Olympic debut this week.His agreement with Aqua Sphere for the ""MP"" line runs through 2020 and includes equity-type elements, which may include royalties or a cut of sales.For Phelps and Aqua Sphere, the stakes are high as they pursue a piece of the global market for competitive and fitness swimwear, estimated to be worth $1 billion in annual sales.They are up against established rivals such as Speedo, a privately owned brand licensed to a unit of apparel firm PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), as well as TYR, owned by swimwear designer Joseph DiLorenzo, and Arena, held by Swiss private equity firm Capvis.Aqua Sphere ""MP"" swim caps are shaped using a special model of Phelps' head and cross the ears at an angle, allowing him to hear the roar of the crowd.Phelps will be back in the pool this week with this cap.Aqua Sphere's Mitchell said the incident would spur the company's development of different swimcap materials such as textiles and different silicon mixes. Sales for other items in the MP line like ""jammers"" or swim trunks have been surging since the Olympics started, Mitchell said.But it was Speedo that clearly enjoyed the night.""Relay races create an opportunity for athletes to support each other differently than any race in the Games. It was great Conor was able to lend Michael his cap following his leg of the relay,"" Speedo USA marketing executive Pierre Martin said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

79,"Jul 06, 2016 07:12AM ET",Air Liquide sees slower growth after U.S. Airgas deal,nan,"By Matthias BlamontPARIS (Reuters) - France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) warned of slower growth in sales and profitability on Wednesday despite a recent U.S. acquisition designed to offset poor economic prospects in Europe, pushing its shares more than 3 percent lower.The industrial gases company, which presented a new strategic plan to investors and analysts in London, said it was seeking revenue growth of 6-8 percent annually between now and 2020. It pledged to deliver a return on capital employed (ROCE) in excess of 10 percent ""after five to six years"".Air Liquide's ROCE, a measure of profitability, stood at 10.3 percent in 2015, short of a target of a 12-13 percent return under its previous multi-year scheme.Shares in Air Liquide, buoyed in the past by steady growth in net profit and dividends, were down 3.6 percent at 90.14 euros at 1050 GMT.Air Liquide bought Airgas (NYSE:ARG), the leader in U.S. packaged gases, in a $13.4 billion transaction finalised in May.When the deal was announced last November, analysts said it would help Air Liquide to overtake rivals  Linde  AG (DE:LING), Air Products and Praxair (NYSE:PX) to top spot in North America and speed diversification away from slow-growth Europe. However, they questioned the hefty premium the company was paying..""The purpose of this event (in London) is to attract investors not only to buy Air Liquide shares but also to participate in the upcoming capital increase in the magnitude of 3-3.5 billion euros (...) part of the financing of the Airgas acquisition,"" Kepler Cheuvreux said in a note to clients.""We maintain our 'Buy' rating on the stock, although we admit that upside from here is moderate,"" the broker added.The group said on Wednesday the acquisition would allow savings of over $300 million while Air Liquide would also achieve other cost cuts of more than 300 million euros ($332 million) on average every year.""The group has acquired a new dimension following the acquisition of Airgas and thus enters a new phase,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Benoit Potier said, adding that he expected ""moderate global growth"" over the coming years as well as ""major changes related to scientific and technological advances"".Potier also said Britain's vote to leave the European Union on June 23 would have a limited effect as group's revenue there only account for 1.5 percent of total sales. Under a previous plan set out for 2011-2015, Air Liquide had sought annual revenue growth of 8-10 percent.Air Liquide said it would strive to maintain a Standard & Poor's ""A"" range credit rating. Following the announcement of the Airgas acquisition, the rating agency downgraded the group's rating by two notches to ""A-"" with a ""stable"" outlook.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

86,"Jan 25, 2016 01:22PM ET",Mega-deals await as Iranian president starts European trip in Rome,nan,"By Crispian Balmer and John IrishROME/PARIS (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani flew to Italy on Monday at the start of his first official visit to Europe, looking to sign multi-billion dollar contracts to help to modernize Iran's economy after years of crippling financial sanctions.Heading a 120-strong delegation of Iranian business leaders and ministers, Rouhani will spend two days in Rome before flying to France on Wednesday, hoping to burnish Tehran's international credentials at a time of turmoil across the Middle East.While diplomacy will figure high on his agenda, trade ties are likely to dominate the headlines, with Iran announcing plans to buy more than 160 European planes, mainly from Airbus (PA:AIRP), on the eve of Rouhani's departure.Officials in Rome said Italian firms were set to sign deals worth up to 17 billion euros ($18.4 billion) over the next two days, including in the energy, infrastructure and steel sectors.The deals will give a boost to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who is struggling to revive Italy's underperforming economy.A pragmatist elected in 2013, Rouhani championed a deal with world powers last year under which Iran curbed its disputed nuclear program in return for the end of U.N., EU and some U.S. sanctions this month.Other U.S. sanctions remain in place, however, and some Western companies such as banks are expected to take a cautious line toward deal-making with Iran in order to avoid falling foul of Washington.Rouhani is anxious to prove to Iranians that the nuclear accord, contested by many hardliners, was worth it and will help ease their prolonged economic hardships. He also wants to promote Iran's position as a major regional player and key to any solution to the long-running conflict in Syria.During his visit to Italy, he will meet Renzi, Pope Francis and local business leaders. He is set to meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Thursday.Rouhani had been expected in both countries last November, but canceled the trips following an attack by Islamic State militants in Paris that killed 130 people.Italian President Sergio Mattarella said at Rouhani's first official engagement in Rome that the battle against Islamic State and fundamentalist extremists was ""the number one threat facing the international community"".Greeted by an honor guard at the president's Quirinale Palace, Rouhani smiled broadly for photographers before heading into a series of meetings.BUILDING TRUSTEurope was Iran's largest trading partner before sanctions, with Italy and France seen as particularly close to Tehran. Both countries sent large trade delegations to Iran last year in the wake of the nuclear accord, laying the groundwork for tie-ups.Among the deals being readied for Italy was a pipeline contract worth between $4 billion and $5 billion for oil services group  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), a source with knowledge of the matter said. Saipem was not immediately available for comment.In addition, Italian steel firm Danieli (MI:DANI) will sign commercial agreements worth up to 5.7 billion euros with Iran, a company spokesman said. Infrastructure firm Condotte d'Acqua said it would sign deals worth up to 4 billion euros.Italian business leaders, including the heads of oil firm Eni (MI:ENI) and carmaker  Fiat  Chrysler (N:FCAU) Automobiles (MI:FCHA), are due to attend a dinner for Rouhani on Monday, hosted by Renzi. At the request of the Iranians, no wine will be served. France refused the same request so there will be no state dinner in Paris.While Italy was not involved in the nuclear talks, France was, and it took a hard line toward Tehran in the negotiations. It has also been outspoken in its condemnation of Iran's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and skeptical of the country's other Middle East interventions.""Trust needs to be built. It's like love. It is only the proof of love that counts,"" said a senior French diplomat.""On the nuclear accord the relationship is relaxed, but not on the other subjects. There is no change on the Iranian position for now on a number of regional issues ... so the idea (of the visit) is to open a new page,"" the diplomat said.The boss of oil group  Total  (PA:TOTF), Patrick Pouyanne, is among top French executives who are expected to hold one-on-one meetings with Rouhani.The trip to Europe comes as global diplomats are trying to arrange the first peace talks in two years to end the Syrian civil war. Shi'ite Muslim Iran is Assad's strongest ally, while European countries back his mainly Sunni Muslim opponents.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

87,"Nov 18, 2015 08:34PM ET",Toyota says its fuel-cell vehicle gaining traction in California,nan,"(Corrects to show that state of California, not Toyota, has pledged to fund building of filling stations in last paragraph)By Alexandria SageLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles are gaining traction in California, where 22 of the company's Mirai cars have been delivered in its first month of availability, company officials said on Tuesday.Toyota has ambitious plans to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles globally by 2020, ramping up from an expected 2,000 next year. Fuel-cell vehicles are a key component of the company's plans to curb polluting emissions to nearly zero by 2050.Toyota will accelerate the ramp-up of plans to sell the Mirai in the United States, Bill Fay, U.S. general manager of the Toyota brand, said at a National Automobile Dealers Association-J.D. Power conference linked to the Los Angeles Auto Show.Toyota sells the Mirai at eight California dealerships, and will expand to nearly 40 dealerships there and at a handful of stores in the U.S. Northeast by the end of 2016.""We are at the ground floor of something that could be huge"" Fay said.The first Mirai was delivered to a California customer on Oct. 21.Toyota has received more than 2,000 expressions of interest in the Mirai. The selling of these cars requires that hand-raisers be contacted to determine if they are eligible, including whether they are near a hydrogen filling station.The Toyota executive said there is a ""chicken-and-egg"" situation of expanding fuel-cell vehicle sales and establishing a network of hydrogen filling stations.Toyota works with two companies to expand hydrogen filling stations, FirstElement Fuel of California and  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) of France. On Tuesday, Air Liquide said it would buy U.S. peer Airgas (N:ARG) in a $13.4 billion deal.Mirai launched in Japan last December and the company is taking orders in Europe as well as in California. Sales will expand next year to five U.S. states - New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.Mirai, which means ""future"" in Japanese, is a four-person sedan that has a range of 300 miles.

89,"Nov 17, 2015 04:19PM ET",U.S. stocks mixed as optimistic inflation bolsters case for rate hike,nan,"Investing.com -- U.S. stocks were mixed on Tuesday as optimistic inflation data bolstered hawkish arguments for a December interest rate hike, offsetting gains in the retail sector following a wave of strong quarterly earnings from Wal-Mart (N:WMT),  Home Depot  (N:HD) and several other industry giants.On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday that its Consumer Price Index rose by 0.2% for the month of October, posting mild gains following two previous months of declines. The Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by 1.9% on a yearly basis, providing indications that long-term inflation could begin to firm in the coming months. The Federal Reserve would like to see inflation move toward its target goal of 2% before it raises its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nearly a decade.A rate hike is largely viewed as bearish for the major indices, as investors depart from their positions in equities to capitalize on higher yields.The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 6.49 or 0.04% to 17,489.50, while the NASDAQ Composite index rose 1.40 or 0.03% to close at 4,986.02, in spite of weakness in Energy and Media stocks.

Stocks in the Energy and Utilities industries industries lagged, each falling by more than 1% on the session.Wal-Mart and Home Depot provided a boost to the Dow, each closing Tuesday's session up by more than 3% in the wake of productive third quarters. Wal-Mart, the world's top retailer, reported earnings of $3.3 billion or 1.03 per share, topping analysts' per share forecasts of 0.98. Earlier this fall, Wal-Mart downgraded its guidance for 2016 due in part to intense competition from Amazon (O:AMZN) in the online marketplace. Home Depot, meanwhile, jumped 5.22 or 4.32% to 126.06 after beating analysts' earnings forecasts last quarter. The results boosted shares in Lowe`s Companies Inc (N:LOW), which is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The worst performer was  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), which lost 1.02 or 1.45 to 69.37.The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Russian telecom company VimpelCom (O:VIP), which gained 0.29 or 8.64% to 3.59. Shares in Vimpelcom are still down more than 40% over the last year. The worst performer was Keurig Green Mountain Inc (O:GMCR), which fell 4.35 or 9.78% to 40.14. Keurig, one of the world's largest coffee companies, has also struggled mightily this year, amid uncertainty regarding the company's new iced coffee maker. Over the last 12 months, Keurig shares are down by approximately 70%.The top performer on the S&P 500 was  Airgas Inc  (N:ARG), which surged more than 29% to 137.16 after  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) SA agreed to acquire the U.S. based gas company in a $13.4 billion deal. The acquisition is expected to strengthen the French industrial gas company's imprint in North America.

94,"Feb 10, 2015 10:09PM ET","Exclusive: France's Sigfox taps Telefonica, GDF Suez to raise $113 million - sources",nan,"By Sophie SassardLONDON (Reuters) - French start-up Sigfox has raised 100 million euros ($112.80 million) from seven heavy-weight investors to help it build new networks globally to connect everything from washing machines to smart meters to the Internet, sources said.The deal, to be announced on Wednesday, is poised to beat French ride-sharing company BlaBlaCar's $100 million fund raising last summer, the sources familiar with the matter said.It is the third time since it was founded by French entrepreneur Ludovic Le Moan five years ago that Sigfox has turned to investors to finance its growth, as the firm aims to roll out its network in 60 countries within the next five years. Investors include Spain's Telefonica and France's GDF Suez, the sources said. Telecoms operators NTT Docomo of Japan, SK Telecom of South Korea, France's Air Liquide and U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management have also invested in Sigfox, the sources said. Sigfox's network covers France, Spain, the Netherlands and 10 of the UK's larger cities. The money raised on Wednesday will finance a roll out in the United States, Latin America, Japan and South Korea with the help of its new corporate investors, which have also signed commercial agreements with Sigfox. The company currently has several millions of objects connected. In Spain, it has equipped five million flats with anti-intrusion alarms with its partner Securitas Direct. Sigfox builds low-energy, low-cost wireless networks to connect objects such as electricity meters, smart watches or washing machines, providing the infrastructure that makes the so-called Internet of Things possible (IOT). Such objects emit small amounts of data at a time and need to be constantly on, so Sigfox is betting that its technology is better suited to this than existing mobile networks owned by telecom operators. That Telefonica is backing Sigfox signals confidence in its technology, and also turns a potential rival into an ally. For industrial gases supplier Air Liquide, teaming up with Sigfox will allow it to track gas bottles all over the world. Having a financial partner like Elliott will also help the French startup build its credibility in order to win new markets, especially in the U.S., the sources said.""They're like the Vodafone of the Internet of Things. They're not running the applications themselves, they're providing the network,"" said William Webb, chief executive of non-profit firm The Weightless SIG which lobbies for open standards in machine-to-machine-communication. ""They're the furthest along at the moment,"" he said, referring to others in the field such as Nwave and Senaptic. Most investors are also looking to recoup their investment through a possible public listing of Sigfox in the coming few years, the sources said. Sigfox currently charges one euro per object connected and is aiming to have at least 100 million of them by 2020, which would translate to 100 million euros in revenue from 3 million euros in 2014, one of the sources said. In ""The Internet of Things: Sizing up the opportunity"", McKinsey consultants forecast that by 2020, the market for connected devices would be between 20 billion or 30 billion units.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

 (Updates with opening stock) By Ernest Scheyder NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Praxair Inc posted a
higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on brisk sales of its
industrial gases around the world, though its shares dropped 3
percent on Wednesday after weeks of strong gains. The company supplies oxygen, helium and other gases used in
hospitals, construction sites and toy balloons. While smaller rival Air Products and Chemicals fought
unsuccessfully to buy Airgas in 2010, Praxair quietly increased
its market share. During the first quarter, Praxair said it would spend $500
million to build facilities for three new customers, a positive
sign of long-term growth potential. ""I'm always interested in how the pipeline looks and what
projects they're bidding on,"" Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co
analyst Christopher Shaw said. ""I'm positive on the company,
and the sector overall has a great business model."" Net income rose to $398 million, or $1.29 per share,
compared with $314 million, or $1.01 per share, a year
earlier. Analysts expected earnings of $1.26 per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 11 percent to $2.7 billion. Analysts expected
$2.64 billion. Sales rose 22 percent to $558 million in South America and
increased 20 percent to $310 million in Asia. North America remained Praxair's breadwinner, though,
bringing in sales of $1.34 billion, an 8 percent increase. The Danbury, Connecticut-based company expects to earn
$1.33 to $1.38 per share in the second quarter. Analysts have
forecast $1.36. A DIFFERENT MODEL Founded in 1907, Praxair embraced the concept of on-site
gas supply after World War Two. The company signs long-term
supply contracts to build an industrial gas plant at a
customer's site, guaranteeing a steady revenue base. The concept is standard practice for the global industrial
gas sector's ""big four"": Praxair, Air Products and Chemicals,
France's Air Liquide and Germany's Linde AG. Praxair is also the only North American supplier to compete
in the three main industrial gas spheres -- on-site, merchant
and packaged gas supply. In the past 52 weeks Praxair's stock has jumped 22 percent,
compared with an 11 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's
500. That has led some on Wall Street to see Praxair's stock as
overvalued. StarMine SmartEstimates, which puts emphasis on
recent forecasts by top-rated analysts, views the company with
an intrinsic value of $102.20, below Tuesday's closing price of
$108.12. Its stock fell 3 percent to $105.07 in early New York Stock

   (Adds analyst comment, detail from statement, background) PARIS, April 26 (Reuters) - Air Liquide posted a
better-than-expected 12.4 percent rise in its first-quarter
revenues thanks to buoyant growth in developing economies and
kept its forecast for net profit growth this year. The French industrial gases maker said on Tuesday that the
number of contracts signed in the quarter continued at a strong
pace and that investments and agreed investments or contracts in
the pipeline, reached nearly 500 million euros. Sales, excluding the effects from natural gas, used to
produce hydrogen, and currency swings, grew a greater than
expected 8.8 percent to 3.543 billion euros ($4.95 billion). Gas and Services sales, which take up the bulk of the
business, rose 15.4 percent to 3.185 billion -- their highest
level ever.  The average result of a Reuters poll among 11 analysts was
for sales of 3.495 billion euros and gas and services sales of
3.080 billion. ""These are solid results and above consensus,"" said CA
Cheuvreux analyst Klaus Ringel. ""There's an ongoing strong
momentum of businesses signed which is increasing very well and
is going in the right direction in achieving their mid and long
term objectives."" Air Liquide saw a wide gap between its growth in mature
economies, still on the mend from the financial crisis, and
developing economies which are investing heavily in their
industrial infrastructures. The Asia Pacific region bolstered Air Liquide gas and
services sales by 36 percent against 10 percent growth in Europe
and the Americas. Air Liquide expects to benefit from a push to cleaner forms
of energy. It supplies ultra pure gases to makers of solar cells
and only last week announced the sealing of 15 new long-term
contracts with photovoltaic companies in Asia and Germany. The impact of the natural and nuclear disaster in Japan as
well as political unrest in Africa and the Middle East has been
very limited, Air Liquide said. Air Liquide's sales precede those of U.S. rival Praxair and
its main competitor Germany's Linde. Air Liquide makes gases like oxygen for the steel sector,
argon for welding, nitrogen for chip makers or hydrogen for
refineries, which it delivers through pipeline networks that
total 8,500 kilometres or in cylinders for small gas quantities. Air Liquide shares closed at 97.90 euros on April 21, before
the Easter break. The stock has climbed 3.44 percent this year. (Reporting by Caroline Jacobs, Editing by Christian Plumb)

 By Joanne Frearson LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - European shares closed lower on
Thursday, with banks and oil stocks the major losers and
Ericsson falling after disappointing results. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
down 1.1 percent at 1,014.72 points. The benchmark index is
still up 57 percent from its lifetime low on March 9, but down
38 percent since reaching its mid-2007 peak. ""These markets are due for a bout of consolidation, if
anyone is looking to book some profits this is as good as time
as any,"" said Mike Lenhoff, strategist at Brewin Dolphin. ""We might get some rough numbers, but if you look at the
whole sweep of newsflow which is being reported then I do not
think anyone can say that what we have seen so far has been
bad,"" he said. Banks featured among the biggest losers. Credit Suisse was
down 3.5 percent after third-quarter earnings, with analysts
pointing to a 16 percent fall in investment banking revenues
from the previous quarter and lower pretax profits and margins
at the private banking unit. HSBC, Banco Santander and BNP Paribas were down 1.1 to 2
percent. Oil stocks fell as crude slipped back 1.1 percent. BG Group
, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total were 0.8 to 1.5 percent lower. Mobile network gear maker Ericsson lost 6.2 percent after it
reported weaker-than-expected quarterly core earnings and a drop
in sales, hit by the global economic downturn.  CHEMICAL STOCKS FALL Chemical stocks were under pressure. Air Liquide was 2.7
percent lower after sales at the French industrial gases group
fell in the third quarter.    ""Those people who believe that
we're on our way to the moon delude themselves. This is a long
hard struggle. We've been waiting for weeks for some kind of a
pullback after the rally,"" said David Buik, senior partner at
BGC Partners. Defensive stocks were in favour, with food producer Nestle
up 1.4 percent. Vodafone gained 3.4 percent with traders pointing to a
positive read-across from results by U.S. telecoms peer AT&T. AT&T reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit as
the popular Apple iPhone helped it land a record number of new
wireless customers for the period. Looking at economic news, the number of U.S. workers filing
new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected
last week, data showed, indicating the labour market remains
fragile despite signs of economic revival. Meanwhile, U.S. home prices fell by a seasonally adjusted
0.3 percent in August, bringing the 12-month decline to 3.6
percent, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said.    Across
Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 1 percent, Germany's DAX
fell 1.2 percent and France's CAC 40 was 1.4 percent lower.

 (Adds analyst comments, background, shares) By Caroline Jacobs PARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Sales at French industrial gases
group Air Liquide fell in the third quarter, but it said annual
sales and net profit would still be similar to 2008 levels as
demand improved, especially in emerging markets. It said tighter cost control, prompted by the credit crisis,
led to savings of 230 million euros ($343 million) in the first
three quarters, just ahead of its 2009 goal for 300 million
euros, resulting in a wider operating margin. Air Liquide, whose gas activities range from putting fizz in
soft drinks to providing hydrogen to oil refineries and health
care gases to hospitals, detected a quarter-on-quarter recovery
in demand, mainly for oxygen and some specialty gases. ""The increase in volumes compared to the second quarter is
noticeable, even if they have not yet returned to the high 2008
levels,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Benoit Potier said in a
statement on Thursday. ""The positive signs observed at the end of the first half
have therefore been confirmed, signalling a trend reversal in
several sectors,"" he added. Air Liquide put a cost efficiency plan in place in 2007,
targeting savings of 600 million euros over three years. Group sales reached 2.98 billion euros ($4.45 billion) in
the third quarter, down 5.2 percent at constant exchange rates
and natural gas prices. Gas and Services sales fell nearly 9 percent to 2.5 billion
euros, down 5.3 percent on a comparable basis for the year, but
up more than 3 percent from the previous quarter. Air Liquide shares were down 2.6 percent at 77.67 euros at
0730 GMT, as some investors had hoped for signs of a more marked
improvement, analysts said. The shares had hit a year high of
80.36 euros two days ago. The DJ Stoxx chemicals index was down
1.5 percent. ""The recovery is there but remains weak, and some investors
had hoped for a surprise,"" said a Paris-based analyst who
declined to be named. ""It is very encouraging that they are sticking to their net
income target and encouraging that cost cuts are ahead of
schedule,"" a London-based analyst said Against the previous quarter, Air Liquide noted a speedier
recovery in emerging markets. In China, it expects to benefit
from the country's booming economy, based on industries such as
chemicals and steel, which use oxygen to make products. Healthcare gases were Air Liquide's only division to show
growth, even at an accelerating pace. Air Liquide's chief rival, Germany's Linde, last month
reiterated it expected a further recovery of its business in the
second half of the year as the economic environment improved. Air Liquide's stock is trading at 17.9 times the company's
expected 2009 earnings per share.

105,"Aug 03, 2009 04:40AM ET",UPDATE 1-Euro zone factory downturn looks almost over,nan,"  (Updates with analyst comment) * Eurozone factory PMI revised up, highest since Aug 2008 * Second-biggest monthly rise in 12-year series history * First rise in demand for consumer goods since May 2008  By Ross Finley LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The euro zone's factory sector
edged closer to recovery in July, a survey suggested on Monday,
with modest output growth in three of the bloc's biggest
economies, Germany, France and Spain. Markit said its revised July euro zone factory Purchasing
Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 46.3 from 42.6. That was the
second-biggest monthly rise in the 12-year series history as the
euro area economy claws its way out of the worst recession since
World War Two. The PMI was revised up slightly from the flash reading of
46.0 published a little over a week ago, and getting ever closer
to the 50.0 mark that divides growth and contraction. It is up
significantly from the record low of 33.5 struck in February. The figures will encourage those who have placed aggressive
bets on a euro zone recovery, sending European stock prices up
more than 40 percent since a low carved in early March. But the
figures do not suggest the sector is headed for robust growth. Financial markets and the euro were unmoved after the data. ""In the industrial sector there's a very promising rebound
and the economy will probably evolve much better than previous
estimates. We expect positive growth in the second half of the
year,"" said Simon Junker at Commerzbank. The PMI for Germany, the euro zone's largest economy and
where many of Europe's best-known manufacturing companies are
based, rose by the biggest amount in that survey's history,
showing the first month of production growth in a year. Prospects for the euro zone in coming months also remained
upbeat and suggest the worst of the recession is now well over. The euro zone manufacturing new orders index, a good
forward-looking indicator for future production, was revised up
to 49.8 from 49.3 and well above the 44.9 recorded for June. The report also noted the first rise in demand for consumer
goods since May 2008, which led to a rapid narrowing in the rate
of decline in production of these goods. Markit said that euro zone manufacturers extended a rapid
inventory decline which, with new orders barely falling, left
the orders to inventory ratio at a 2-1/2 year high. That suggested higher production ahead as companies are
forced to re-stock their warehouses. But not all European manufacturers are sounding upbeat on
the outlook. The chief executive of Siemens, the industrial conglomerate
seen as a bellwether of Germany's economy, said on Thursday that
the company was preparing for a long period of slow growth in
developed markets. French industrial gases group Air Liquide also said on
Thursday it would be prudent for the remainder of this year and
next because the economic downturn was still biting. ""The crisis is still there, the average level of production
is more or less the same,"" said its chairman and chief executive
officer Benoit Potier. Employment in euro zone manufacturing companies deteriorated
at a rapid pace in July, although slower than in June, according
to the Markit data. Official statistics on Friday showed joblessness rose to a
10-year high of 9.4 percent in June, but well below forecasts. ""We will continue to see bad figures for a while,"" said
Junker. Markit polls around 3,000 manufacturing companies each month
across the 16-member bloc that hold the euro. (Editing by Andy Bruce)

107,"Nov 04, 2008 08:40AM ET","Europe builders seen up, defence down if Obama wins",nan," LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - European building materials and
construction stocks could be big gainers from a Barack Obama win
in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, while defence companies
would get a boost if rival John McCain won, analysts said. Democrat Obama led Republican McCain in five of eight key
battleground states, according to a series of Reuters/Zogby
polls as the two candidates face the verdict of U.S. voters
following a long and bitter campaign. ""Obama would spend a lot of money on the public sector,
which would be good for road builders. A landslide Obama win
would also be good for retailers because it would come with a
feel-good factor that would boost consumer spending,"" said Mark
Bon, fund manager at Canada Life. Analysts said the concrete details of Obama's plans for the
economy would have a big bearing on which stocks would benefit. ""A lot hinges on the flavour of what the stimulus is. If
it's going to be just tax cuts, in which case people are going
to look at some of the discretionary end of the consumer spend.
Potentially leisure and retail could do well,"" said Philip
Lawlor, chief portfolio strategist at Nomura. ""My read is that it's going to be a big package of $150
billion but it's much more skewed towards infrastructure, in
which case once the legislation starts to come through people
will realise this has to be beneficial for the construction
stocks and material stocks."" Societe Generale said in a note late last month that it
expected European commercial banking, construction, healthcare
equipment and insurance to benefit from an Obama win. It picked CRH, Holcim and Lafarge as potential winners among
the construction companies, while BBVA and Santander would be
gainers among the banks as opportunities arose to buy U.S.
regional banks. ""A new president with a clear mandate would also be good for
the dollar, and that would boost European exporters,"" Bon said. Aerospace and defense, pharma, investment banking and asset
management, luxury goods, oil, chemicals and nuclear energy
could gain from a McCain win. SocGen picked defence groups BAE Systems, Cobham, drugmakers
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline and Credit Suisse and UBS in the
investment banking and asset management universe. It said luxury goods group LVMH, oil producers BP and Royal
Dutch Shell, industrial gases group Air Liquide and nuclear
energy players Areva, EDF and GDF Suez would also be likely
winners under McCain. Whatever the outcome, analysts said that the progress of a
$700 billion financial stimulus programme agreed under outgoing
President George W. Bush would be key. ""We do think it opens the way as well, more fundamentally
and more relevantly for equity markets at this juncture, for a
speed-up in the fiscal stimulus programme. That is what we will
really be looking at,"" said Ian Richards, strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland.
