7,"Apr 18, 2019 05:00AM ET",Nestle and Unilever Raise Prices Without Stunting Growth,nan,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s consumer-goods giants are showing new signs of life by selling more food and cleaning supplies, even at higher prices.Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) surprised investors with strong starts to the year, reporting first-quarter sales growth that handily topped analysts’ estimates. The Swiss maker of KitKat bars and the Anglo-Dutch owner of Dove soap each cited a combination of improved pricing and higher volumes.Unilever rose as much as 3.6 percent in Amsterdam as Nestle traded as much as 1.3 percent higher in Zurich.The companies delivered a counterpoint to the cost-cut-driven performance of U.S. rival Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co., which has slumped since a profit warning and asset write-down in February -- about two years after it made an unsuccessful approach to take over Unilever. Instead, the European multinationals joined U.S. peers like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. in selling more of their products. The companies also successfully passed higher raw-materials costs on to consumers.At Nestle, for example, the pricing gain of 1.2 percent was the biggest in 10 quarters. The businesses most hit by inflation included bottled water, with higher oil prices making plastic and transport more expensive. Unilever also noted higher costs of petrochemicals such as linear alkylbenzene, an ingredient in biodegradable detergents, along with increased prices for raw materials in the food sector.On Wednesday,  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) forecast milk-price inflation in high single digits this year, plus more expensive sugar and fruit. While sugar prices have risen over the past year, other commodities such as cocoa and coffee have fallen.“What companies like ourselves face is the impact of the input-costs increases and commodity-driven gains on the ground,” Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said by phone. PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said earlier this week that the drinks and snacks giant expects commodity inflation to increase over the rest of the year.While Europe and Japan are suffering from stubbornly low price increases or even deflation, higher rates of inflation are popping up in places like Turkey and Argentina. Moroccan consumers have held an informal boycott of Danone products via social media over the past year to protest what consumers see as unfair prices.While managing to raise prices, Nestle and Unilever also benefited by expanding into new areas as their old-line brands stagnate. Sales in Unilever’s home-care division, which grew at about twice the pace of the group figure, were driven in part by more eco-conscious products under the company’s Seventh Generation and Omo laundry brands. Acquisitions the Anglo-Dutch company has made since 2015 collectively grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter.Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has signed $14 billion of deals in 2018. The food giant has also been trying to fix or sell underperformers, with a sale for its Herta lunch-meat unit possibly coming by midyear and its dermatological business by year-end.Beating EstimatesNestle’s revenue climbed 3.4 percent on an organic basis in the first quarter, as Schneider beat the 2.8 percent analyst consensus by the biggest margin since he started leading the world’s largest food company in 2017.At Unilever, underlying sales rose 3.1 percent in the quarter. As with Nestle, analysts had expected 2.8 percent.A smaller consumer-focused company,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) SA, joined in the optimism on Thursday. While it missed sales-growth estimates for its fiscal third quarter, the French distiller raised its forecast for full-year growth in operating profit to about 8 percent from a range of 6 percent to 8 percent.(Updates with shares in third paragraph, inflation examples in fifth paragraph.)"

My ambition remains to deliver on our strategic plan, that's my motto,"" CEO Alexandre Ricard said in a telephone interview.Pernod, which is the world's second-biggest spirits group behind  Diageo  (LON:DGE), is under pressure from New York hedge fund Elliott Management to improve profit margins and corporate governance.In February, Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns under a three-year plan that Elliott described as a first small step.When asked about speculation that Pernod could sell the whole or part of its wine business, Ricard replied: ""Pernod Ricard has the firm intention to continue to actively manage its portfolio, in terms of either selling or buying.""Last month Bloomberg reported Pernod was considering the sale of its wine division, which includes Australian brand Jacob's Creek and Spain's Campo Viejo and makes roughly 5 percent of group sales.Ricard, whose company makes Havana Club rum in Cuba, added he was ""not worried"" about Pernod's business in Cuba, despite latest moves by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.The Trump administration is lifting a long-standing ban against U.S. citizens filing lawsuits against foreign companies that use properties seized by Cuba’s Communist government since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.The major policy shift, which the State Department said could draw hundreds of thousands of legal claims worth tens of billion of dollars, is intended to intensify pressure on Havana at a time Washington is demanding an end to Cuban support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

10,"Apr 15, 2019 07:25PM ET",Ageless in Japan: Suntory sells 'world whisky' blend as premium tipple,nan,"By Ritsuko Ando and Martinne GellerTOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Suntory Holdings, faced with a whisky crunch, is selling a rare mix sourced from around the world as premium whisky, aiming to elevate the status of young blends among discerning drinkers who often swear by aged single malts.Whisky makers globally, and in Japan in particular, have been forced to suspend some aged bottles in recent years as a surge in demand for mature whisky depleted stocks.Last year, Suntory suspended the popular 17-year Hibiki - a glass of which Bill Murray's character in the film 'Lost in Translation' famously promoted, saying ""For relaxing times, make it Suntory time"". Now it sells online for 40,000 yen ($357) versus 10,000 yen some years ago.In a bid to expand its options, Suntory, on Tuesday, started selling an unusual alternative, ""Ao"", a no-age statement (NAS) blend made with whisky from Scotland, the United States, Ireland, Japan and Canada.Priced at 5,000 yen per bottle, it is a five-country blend rarely ever tried by whisky makers, but possible for Suntory given the global assets at its disposal following its $13.6 billion purchase of U.S. spirits maker Beam in 2014.While Ao will be sold exclusively in Japan, with 30,000 dozen-bottle cases being shipped this year, it will be closely watched by rivals across the $6 billion global industry as they too grapple with dwindling supplies of premium stocks.Unlike other hard liquor such as vodka or gin, whisky needs to be aged in barrels over anywhere between three and 50 years, meaning producers must predict demand decades in advance. As a result, many have introduced NAS whiskies to manage supply.Global distilleries including The Macallan, owned by Edrington, The Glenlivet, owned by  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), and Diageo's Talisker have launched NAS variants in recent years. Pernod says its NAS Founder's Reserve has been a great success with a new generation of drinkers, becoming the sixth-biggest single malt Scotch globally in 2017 two years after it was launched, when there was a temporary shortage of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old.     ""Since then we have been working hard to future-proof this expression and ensure that supply is secured for the long term,"" said Miriam Eceolaza, marketing director for malts at Pernod's Chivas Brothers whisky unit, adding that Glenlivet 12 is back in some markets, such as Britain, with more to come.Most NAS whiskies are priced modestly versus longer-aged whiskies, due in part to the industry's success at persuading drinkers that older whiskies are better. ""It's no mystery you can charge a lot for something with a very old age statement on it, but how can you add value to younger, NAS whisky, thus making it more profitable?"" asked Chuck Cowdery, publisher of The Bourbon Country Reader. ""If you can make a valuable product from a larger inventory pool and be successful with it, that becomes more than just a prestige project. That's something you can take to the bank."" PRICINGHowever, whisky experts say it is hard to say whether a ""world whisky"" will catch on in the premium category.Ao's price is more than Chita, a no-age Japanese single grain, or a 10-year old Laphroaig, both owned by Suntory and available for around 3,400 yen online. It also costs double rival Nikka's From the Barrel, a malt and grain blend with no-age statement. But some observers say Ao's price does not look outrageous versus say the 63,000 yen Ichiro's Malt & Grain Maduro blend - one of the few other bottles sourced from five countries but using older whiskies matured in French oak wine barrels.Suntory, which started in 1899 by making and selling wine, denies ""Ao"" is a result of the shortage, although its executives said they wanted to expand the range of what is available. The company is private, but its food and non-alcoholic drinks arm, Suntory Beverage & Food is listed. In addition to the Hibiki 17, Suntory last year halted sales of its 12-year Hakushu too, while rival Nikka, owned by Asahi Group Holdings, has also suspended aged single malts.""It pains us that there are still limitations in supply, even though we have established increased production,"" Kengo Torii, head of the Suntory's whisky division, has said.PROVENANCEAo's launch comes amid growing questions around provenance, as loose Japanese regulations have meant imported whisky, when bottled or blended in the country, can be passed off as local.With Ao, Suntory is aiming at transparency, while showing off its global assets and blending skills.Suntory's chief blender, Shinji Fukuyo, says he was initially wary of the assignment. ""I couldn't at all imagine what it would taste like,"" he told Reuters ahead of the launch, adding it took multiple trials to make the ""Ao"" blend.Whisky from Alberta Distillers in Canada is Ao's biggest constituent, followed by liquid from Jim Beam's Clermont and Booker Noe distilleries. Scotland's Ardmore and Glen Garioch, Ireland's Cooley and Japan's Yamazaki and Hakushu distilleries contribute to a lesser extent.Some whisky aficionados will always seek an age statement for sign of quality, Bernstein's European beverages analyst Trevor Stirling said, adding that some high-quality blends, like the Johnnie Walker Blue, Green and Gold, deserve recognition.""So there are some whisky snobs who say if it isn't single malt I'm not drinking it ... I think blended whiskies are unfairly looked down upon.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

11,"Apr 11, 2019 04:02AM ET",StockBeat - Luxury Goods Shine After Another Big Quarter for LVMH,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s been a tough 12 months for most sectors in Europe’s stock market. Exporters of capital goods have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war, banks and financial services hobbled by negative interest rates, consumer stocks struggling to escape the shackles of low wage growth and demographic decline.But one sector has been a relatively constant bright light, and it’s leading the way again this Thursday. Luxury goods makers are roaring ahead after another strong quarter for LVMH (PA:LVMH), the French drinks-to-fashion group.LVMH announced after the bell on Wednesday that its revenue grew 16% on the year in the first quarter and said the positive trends that had helped it to a record year in 2018 were still in place. Most remarkably, in a world economy that is supposedly suffering a synchronized slowdown, the group said that “all geographic regions are experiencing good growth.”The news has sent the stock up 3.1% on a day when most indexes are down, due in part to frustration at the prospect of another six months of uncertainty over Brexit.  As of 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was at 385.12, down 1.56 points or 0.4%. The FTSE 100 was down 0.5%, while the German DAX was down 0.4%. The Paris CAC 40 was outperforming, down less than 0.1%, thanks mainly to its luxury names.As has often been the case, LVMH’s performance is supporting the rest of the sector. Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and scarf-maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) were close behind it at the top of the CAC 40, while Italian rivals Salvatore Ferragamo  (MI:SFER) and Moncler (MI:MONC) were also both among the best performers in Milan.The results have distracted attention away from one less pleasant piece of news that may come back to haunt the sector in due course. French police raided the premises of some of the country’s drinks makers on Wednesday on suspicion of anti-competitive practices.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a drinks maker that doesn’t have the same exposure to fashion as the other stocks in the sector, is the notable laggard this morning, rising only 0.3%."

Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) said they were not targeted while Marie Brizard declined to comment. LVMH and Remy Cointreau could not be immediately reached for comment.The raids did not imply the companies were guilty, the watchdog said."
13,"Apr 09, 2019 07:54AM ET",Exclusive: Bottle maker Verallia set for possible 4 billion euros IPO - sources,nan,"By Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group Apollo is preparing French glass bottle maker Verallia for a stock market listing later this year, in what could become one of the largest French initial public offerings of the year, people close to the matter said. The private equity firm, which is working with Lazard as its IPO advisor, has asked banks to pitch in coming days for roles in organizing the flotation, which could value Verallia at more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion), they said.Rothschild is advising Verallia, they added.Verallia, which traces its roots back to the Vauxrot glassworks founded in 1827, counts  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), champagne house Dom Perignon and chocolate spreads maker Nutella among its clients.So-called global coordinators are expected to be mandated later this month or in May for the IPO of Saint-Gobain's former glass bottle unit, in which Apollo bought a controlling stake in 2015. The listing may happen in September or later, they said. Apollo and Lazard declined to comment, while Rothschild had no immediate comment.France has seen few IPOs recently and some deals, such as that of logistics firm Gefco, have been pulled due to wobbly market conditions. Tourism group Club Med's parent chose Hong Kong for its listing.Among the few other large French companies which may seek a stock market listing this year is state-owned lottery firm Francaise des Jeux, a stake in which could be sold under a law published last year.Across Europe initial public offerings slumped in the first quarter to their lowest since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as uncertainty over Brexit and the U.S.- China trade dispute left companies not wanting to take their chances.Verallia is expected to post core earnings (EBITDA) of roughly 550 million euros this year and could be valued at between 7 and 8 times that in a potential IPO, the sources said. Peers such as Vetropack, Owens-Illinois (NYSE:OI) or Vidrala trade in a wide range of 2.7 to 9.4 times EBITDA.Apollo bought the majority of Verallia in a 2015 deal valuing the business at 2.95 billion euros. It made 16 billion glass bottles and jars last year and is the main supplier of bottles for France's champagne and cognac industries. In 2018, the company - which employs nearly 10,000 people - generated 544 million euros in adjusted EBITDA on sales of 2.4 billion.Earlier this month, Verallia announced the early repayment of some of its debt, citing solid cash flow generation, pushing its net debt down to 1.7 billion euros or 3.1 times core 2018 earnings.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

14,"Apr 05, 2019 09:25AM ET",France preparing to fight activist funds: finance minister,nan,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - The French government is preparing measures to prevent activist funds destabilizing French companies, the country's finance minister told Reuters in an interview.Activist funds are increasingly active in Europe, buying up stakes in companies they feel are underperforming and pushing for changes in strategy to extract more value for shareholders. The practice has been common in the U.S. for many years but slower to take off in Europe as big stakes held by founding families or even the state proved a deterrent.In France, New York hedge fund Elliott Management is currently piling pressure on drinks giant  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), CIAM is tussling with reinsurer Scor, Amber Capital has acquired a stake in Lagardere and Searchlight Capital Partners said earlier this week it was investing in aeronautics company Latecoere. ""I am thinking about new national instruments that would make it possible to better resist activist funds,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters in Bucharest, where he was attending an EU finance ministers meeting.The plan would make it possible for the state to invest in companies it deemed to be of national interest, he said, declining to give further details other than saying the proposals would be ready in the coming months.""It's a subject I follow very closely because an activist fund that destroys value does not conform with the new capitalism I want to build,"" he added.Le Maire has championed an overhaul of French corporate law encouraging long-term investment and employee profit-sharing schemes. Parliament is due to vote on the legislation next week.Le Maire said there was a place for investment funds which helped improve a company's performance, but activist funds that destroyed longer-term value by trying to boost short-term profitability ""should be fought"".Elliott's campaign to improve profit margins and corporate governance at Pernod has fueled concerns that no company is immune.Not only does the group's founding family hold a large stake, it is generally considered to be well managed already.Last month, France's Bpifrance pubic investment bank said it had 2 billion euros available to fend off potential activist attacks on French firms if needed.Through the bank, the French government last week increased its stake in car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), which has previously been targeted by activist investors. Valeo also currently counts among its shareholders Chicago-based activist Harris Associates, which after Bpifrance's move said it supported management.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

15,"Apr 03, 2019 01:44AM ET",Pernod Ricard betting on growth from green agenda,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Drinks group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which is being targeted by activist investor Elliott, is banking that its push into socially and environmentally sound business practices will boost its growth in the coming decade. Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits group behind  Diageo  (LON:DGE), is unveiling on Wednesday a strategic roadmap plan going up to 2030.That plan includes eight pledges to undertake socially responsible business habits, such as preserving and looking after the land used to produce its Martell cognac or Mumm champagne brands.Other pledges include aims to save water and cut down on waste and carbon emissions, as well as fighting alcohol abuse and promoting gender balance in its top management teams.Companies around the world are tweaking business models to ensure they capture the current vogue for having strong environmental, social and corporate governance habits ('ESG').This is partly to win over ""Millennial"" customers who are often keen to help the environment, and to attract investments from funds that specialize in putting trillions of dollars into companies screened for having good ethical criteria.""It's about making sure we have a very cohesive plan of action that addresses all aspects of our business from grain to glass,"" said Pernod executive Vanessa Wright, speaking to Reuters ahead of the publication of the new Pernod plan.BROADER PLANS TO BOOST PROFITSPernod - together with peers such as Diageo, Danone and Nestle - is looking to respond to new demands from consumers choosing healthier diets and lifestyles seen as helping the environment and communities.Wright, who is group vice-president for Sustainability & Responsibility at Pernod, said the new ethical pledges formed part of Pernod's broader plan to lift profits and sales, with the French company under pressure from Elliott. New York hedge fund Elliott Management wants Pernod to improve profit margins and corporate governance.Pernod, which also makes Absolut vodka and Jameson whiskey, has already vowed to raise operating margins by 50-60 basis point each year between now and 2021, provided it can deliver annual organic sales growth of 4-7 percent.Pernod is also promising to close the gender pay gap across its business by 2022.In the last eight years, some 95 percent of Pernod's vineyards have been awarded formal certificates to show they do not harm the environment, while those vineyards have also cut back on the amount of water used and their carbon emissions. ""A lot of these actions will create long-term value. Value will also come from consumers being more attracted to our brands and we will also save some costs,"" said Wright.By 2030, Pernod is committing to halve its carbon footprint levels from 2.84 million tonnes per year at present.It is also hoping to replenish 100 percent of the water consumption at production sites, and will ban promotional items made from single-use plastic by 2025, among other gestures.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In 2018, Morgan Stanley advised on 22 campaigns, working with Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), SandRidge Energy and Cigna (NYSE:CI) when those companies faced pressure from prominent agitators such as Elliott Management and Carl Icahn, the data showed.Unlike announced mergers and acquisitions, many companies that fend off activists do so quietly and do not want their advisers making the situations public. This can create discrepancies in the data gathered in the league tables. Goldman Sachs advised on 18 public campaigns in 2018. In 2017 Goldman advised on six public deals, trailing Morgan Stanley, Lazard and Raymond James, claiming the fourth spot, Refinitiv data shows. Lazard dropped to the number three spot in 2018, advising 16 companies. In 2017, a less busy year overall, Lazard advised 14 companies.Spotlight Advisors, founded by Greg Taxin, a lawyer who worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and Banc of America Securities, made its first appearance on the list, capturing the No. 4 four spot ahead of UBS, Citi, Raymond James,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Moelis & Co. Activists were busier than ever last year and launched 500 campaigns, 5 percent more than in 2017. They pushed companies to spin off divisions and asked for board seats, among other demands.Consumer cyclical companies were the most heavily targeted last year, Refinitiv said, with 90 campaigns in the sector. One prominent campaign was at Campbell Soup Co, where Daniel Loeb's Third Point tried to replace all directors and initially pushed for a sale of the company.Elliott Management, which launched campaigns at BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) Ltd, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) last year, was ranked as the busiest activist, having launched 27 campaigns in 2018.It beat out GAMCO Investors for the top spot.Starboard Value, ranked as the third-busiest activist with 11 campaigns in 2018. Innisfree and Okapi were the top proxy solicitors, firms hired to gather shareholders' votes, while Olshan Frome Wolosky beat out two competitors to rank as the busiest law firm with 101 mandates working for activists.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

21,"Feb 21, 2019 12:45PM ET","Engie to scale back overseas, cut costs to boost revenues: sources",nan,"By Geert De Clercq and Benjamin MalletPARIS (Reuters) - Utility Engie is poised to cut back its geographical spread of businesses and focus on grids and renewables in a 1 billion euro cost-cutting drive to bolster revenues, sources familiar with the matter said. Engie has been criticized for being too complex and conglomerate-like and CEO Isabelle Kocher is expected to address this in a 2019-2021 corporate strategy plan to be announced next Thursday, when the company also releases 2018 results.Two sources with knowledge of the company's plans said Kocher was likely to scale back the number of countries Engie operates in - it is present in some 70 countries - notably in central Europe.Both said Kocher would focus the gas and power group more strongly on grids and renewables after selling some 15 billion worth of fossil-fuel related assets in 2016-18.One of the two sources, a union official, said Kocher would aim to cut costs by 1 billion over three years, extending a 1.3 billion euro cost reduction plan in 2016-18.Daily business newsletter La Lettre A had first reported that Engie was targeting a billion-euro profit-boosting plan.Engie will also need to acquire at least one well-established, cash-generating business too make up for cash flow lost in its move away from fossil fuels, two sources, including a banker, said. ""The plan will have to involve major acquisitions. The planets are aligned, but the target remains to be decided,"" one of them said. Potential targets include the Transportadora Associada de Gás pipeline owned by Petrobras, Dutch renewables utility Eneco, or the U.S. renewable energy assets of Portugual's EDPS, sources said. Engie cut is net debt to core earnings ratio to 2.2 at the end of 2017 from 2.5 two years earlier. It can further boost its financial firepower by selling part of its 75 percent stake in French gas transport firm GRTgaz, which will become possible under the government's new ""Loi Pacte"" law. Engie declined to comment on strategy or potential targets ahead of next week's presentation. ACTIVIST INVESTORSMore than anything, Kocher and new chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu have to come with plan that reduces Engie's conglomerate discount and boosts its shares. This is because the government's plan to cut its 23.64 percent holding will remove Engie's best defense against activist investors.""For now, the state's presence is a deterrent for activist investors, but once it leaves, Engie becomes a possible target,"" said an investment banker familiar with the company's thinking. Activist investor Elliott Management's acquisition of a 2.5 percent stake in drinks firm  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) in December has focused minds across France's CAC40 bluechip index on the need for a clear strategy, attractive valuation and close relationships with major shareholders.At German rival Uniper, the presence of Elliott and activist investor Knight Vinke has become a source of tension in the company's relationship with Finnish shareholder Fortum.BELGIAN POISON PILLEngie's deeply discounted stock price shows the valuation potential of splitting off some of the group's assets. With a 0.95 price/book ratio, Engie is the second-most undervalued share in the Stoxx European utilities index, with only Uniper more undervalued by that measure, Refinitiv Eikon data shows. More focused utilities trade at much higher multiples, with renewable energy group Orsted and Innogy around 2.5 times book and grid pureplays like Red Electrica and Terna trading at nearly three times book. ""Engie's conglomerate discount is due to its complexity,"" one banker said.A large UK-based institutional investor said the company was ""a black box"", incomprehensible to investors. Bankers and advisers say Kocher's biggest problem - Engie's nuclear assets in Belgium - may offer its strongest defense against an activist attack. Belgium plans to phase out nuclear energy by 2025, which will leave Engie the decades-long expensive task of decommissioning its seven nuclear plants there.""When an activist takes aim at a company, it is usually because he sees something that management doesn't. But I don't see what solution an activist could bring for Belgian nuclear,"" the banker said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

22,"Feb 13, 2019 09:45AM ET",French wine and spirits exports shrug off weak China to hit record in 2018,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - French wine and spirits exports topped 13 billion euros ($14.7 billion) for the first time in 2018 even though shipments to China fell sharply as its economy slowed and trade tensions rose, exporters group FEVS said on Wednesday.Sales abroad of wines and spirits -- France's second-biggest export after aerospace -- rose 2.4 percent in value to a new record of 13.2 billion euros, the Federation of French Wines and Spirit Exporters said.A premium branding strategy in the Cognac, Champagne and Bordeaux sector compensated for a historically poor harvest in 2017, which lead to a 2.7 percent fall in exported volumes.The main driver of the rise was the United States, where sales reached 3.2 billion euros, up 4.6 percent on 2017. The U.S. market is by far the largest overseas for French wines and spirits, representing nearly a quarter of all such exports. In contrast, exports to China tumbled 14.4 percent in 2018 to 1 billion euros after growing 24.5 percent a year earlier.That fall was largely offset by an 8.3 percent rise in exports to Singapore, at 901 million euros, and to Hong Kong, up 12.3 percent at 556 million euros. Both cities are used as logistics hubs to supply the Chinese market, FEVS Chairman Antoine Leccia told Reuters.""Taking into account these hubs that are Hong Kong and Singapore, exports are almost stable,"" he said.Large French cognac groups like  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) (Martell), LVMH (Hennessy) and Remy Cointreau (Remy Martin) have reported strong sales to China last year.Wine exports dropped 4.6 percent in volume after repeated bad weather including frosts and storms cut output to a record low in 2017 but lower availability pushed up prices, so that exports gained 2.6 percent in value to 8.9 billion euros.Spirits exports continued to grow, with sales up 1.8 percent to 4.3 billion euros, still driven by cognac, exports of which rose 1.7 percent in value last year to 3.1 billion euros. That was nevertheless much slower than the 10.8 percent growth posted a year earlier.Looking ahead, wine and spirits exporters remain confident despite international trade turmoil and uncertainty about Britain's impending exit from the European Union. ""Exports are expected to rise again in China and the United States have remarkable fundamentals,"" Leccia said.Like many others French wine and spirits exporters have been preparing for an abrupt no-deal Brexit by building up stockpiles in Britain. Some have reserves to last until September, six month after the country is due to leave the EU.Every day, about 200 wine and spirits trucks are crossing the border between France and the UK, Leccia said.($1 = 0.8832 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

23,"Feb 12, 2019 03:31PM ET",Pernod CEO pursues change and engages activist shareholder,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) will embrace change and continue ""constructive"" talks with activist investor Elliott Management, CEO Alexandre Ricard said on Tuesday while dismissing speculation that the company could become a takeover target.The world's second-biggest spirits group behind  Diageo  (LON:DGE) is under pressure from New York hedge fund Elliott Management to improve profit margins and corporate governance.Last week Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns in a three-year strategic plan that Elliott described as a first small step.Chief Executive Ricard, the grandson of the French drinks group's founder, said he welcomed Elliott's perspective.""We met in January. We will continue to have an open dialogue with Elliott in the coming weeks or months, as we do with other shareholders,"" he told Reuters. A spokeswoman for the fund declined to comment on Tuesday. Ricard said talks with Elliott centered around governance and margin improvement, adding that Pernod is a consolidator rather than a takeover target.""I hope there will be no surprise if I reiterate very clearly and specifically -- Pernod Ricard is here, Pernod Ricard is here to stay and Pernod Ricard is and will remain a consolidator.""Elliott's arrival has raised speculation of potential dealmaking. A source close to the matter told Reuters in December that Elliott had suggested options such as merging with another spirits company. Ricard declined to comment on the likelihood that Elliott would seek a seat on the board of the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell cognac. Pernod shares closed down 1.3 percent.NECESSARY TRANSFORMATIONPernod's 46-year-old CEO, who once worked as an M&A consultant at U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and appeared bare-chested at his desk in an internal promotional video last year, acknowledged that change is necessary for success. ""The mandate I think I've been given is quite clear. It's to consistently and ruthlessly pursue value creation over time,"" Ricard said. ""If you want a company to succeed and stay over time, that company needs to transform itself permanently. Consumers change over time, the environment changes, the dynamic changes -- if you don't keep transforming yourself, it's not going to happen.""He declined to say whether having Elliott as a shareholder helped him to push the message on the need for change within the company, or what governance initiatives might be in the pipeline.When asked about double voting rights for longtime shareholders - which are often granted by French companies after two years - Ricard said there were no plans to change the company's practice of affording them only after 10 years. One source had told Reuters the company's current policy limited the influence of outsiders. However, Ricard said the rights were open to all qualifying shareholders, not just those close to the Ricard family.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

26,"Feb 08, 2019 07:58AM ET",Activist Elliott tells Pernod there is still work to do,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott kept up the pressure on French spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), welcoming this week's first-half results but calling for boardroom changes and better margins.Elliott, which has built a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod Ricard, has called on the family-backed group to raise profit margins to bring them more into line with British rival  Diageo  (LON:DGE).Elliott has suggested 500 million euros ($565 million) in cost cuts and options such as merging with another spirits company.The hedge fund, which has become increasingly active in Europe in recent years, issued a statement on Friday after Pernod's results this week when the group raised its profit growth outlook for 2018-2019 and unveiled new margin goals in a three-year strategy plan.""Pernod's half-year earnings announcement confirmed the strong growth potential and solid financial performance of the company. It also reflected a first small step in starting to address the company's shortcomings in operational efficiency,"" Elliott said.Last month, Pernod Ricard took a step towards improving its governance, naming Patricia Barbizet to the newly created role of lead independent director.Nevertheless, Elliott on Friday made clear it wanted more.""Necessary enhancements to the company's board and corporate governance have yet to be addressed,"" Elliott said.FAMILY TIESChief Executive Alexandre Ricard, 46-year-old grandson of the firm's founder, made sales growth his top priority when he took over in 2015 and has defended his long-term value strategy.Elliott has blamed Pernod's underperformance in part on what it views as poor governance, having highlighted that Pernod's 15-member board needs more diversity and independence, since many directors are linked to the Ricard family.One indicator of the family's influence, which was controversial, was double-voting rights at Pernod Ricard, a source familiar with the situation said. Most French companies have a two-year period before an investor can get these rights while at Pernod Ricard it is 10 years, restricting the influence of outsiders.Elliott also said Pernod's targeted savings of 100 million euros and a margin step-up of 50-60 basis points per year over the next three years were ""modest goals"" for a company of its size.Liberum analysts, which had hoped for a margin step up of some 150 basis points, also called Pernod's plan a ""a bit soft"".Pernod shares traded 0.6 percent lower by 1115 GMT.A spokesman for Pernod Ricard told Reuters that its first-half results this week showed how its strategy was working, and that Pernod ""remains focused on executing its strategy plan while continuing a regular dialogue with all its shareholders"".($1 = 0.8821 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Another drop in German industrial output, out Thursday, is consistent with that, but it’s  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), which announced a big recall of Dodge Ram trucks Wednesday (and which reports fourth-quarter earnings later today), that’s the biggest loser.At 05:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT) the Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 23 points, or 0.7%, at 3189.65.Those lower down the auto food chain are also suffering. Osram Licht AG (DE:OSRn) – the Siemens lighting spin-off that is a big supplier to the auto industry – said it swung to a loss in the three months to December thanks to the slowdown in China, and in automotive in particular. That's weighing on other suppliers such as Continental (DE:CONG) and Covestro (DE:1COV) in Germany, and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France.Travel companies are again making negative headlines: Tui AG NA (DE:TUIGn) fell over 16% after missing its 2018 profit target and saying that 2019 margins look weaker. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook (LON:TCG), which lost over 75% last year, rose after saying it’s looking at selling its airline business, and Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) confirmed a $257 million loss last year after a 71% rise in its fuel costs.The good news is coming, again, from the energy and the food and drink sectors.  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP), maker of Jameson’s whiskey and Martell cognac, followed  Diageo  (LON:DGE) in reporting strong fourth-quarter numbers and predicting a robust 2019. And French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) reported a record year for output and beat expectations for fourth-quarter profit, but its shares edged down slightly.Italy’s bombed-out banks are also having a strong morning after Unicredit (MI:CRDI) posted its highest annual profit in a decade – despite the headwinds from its operations in Turkey and its home market. Rivals  Intesa Sanpaolo  SpA (MI:ISP) also reported stronger-than-expected numbers Wednesday."

Don't do anything silly, please.""Medic chuckled as he recounted the moment.""It was 18:43. Too late.""Three hours earlier, at least four gunmen and a suicide bomber had stormed 14 Riverside Drive, a leafy office, restaurant and hotel complex in the heart of Kenya's capital, kicking off a 20-hour siege in which 21 people were killed.At 3.39 p.m. (1339 GMT), Medic, the 56-year-old Swiss founder of a private security firm, was on his way home from work in a taxi when he saw injured people being carried along the side of the road.At the same moment, a flurry of WhatsApp messages pinged on his phone from a group called ""LFH (Licensed Firearm Holders) Kenya.""""Seems to be an attack of some sort. Heavy explosions and gunfire,"" one message read.Medic turned the taxi around and headed towards the complex, a plush regional headquarters for international companies such as Colgate Palmolive,  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and SAP.As the car hit traffic, he grabbed his khaki emergency bag and ran the remaining 500 metres towards the billowing black smoke and the sound of gunfire.""At the time, there was no thought about being a hero,"" Medic told Reuters. ""It was automatic.""Entering the compound, he joined forces with two Kenyans in civilian clothes, each carrying a 9mm carbine and a shotgun.Medic drew his pistol. The motley volunteers were the first rescuers on the scene.At 3.59 p.m. they made their way past three burning cars and discovered the glass facade of I&M Bank riddled with bullet holes.""Somewhere in my mind, I hoped that it was just a bank robbery gone wrong, because bank robbers, after all, are more reasonable people than terrorists,"" he said.    KITCHEN KNIVESRounding the corner, they heard gunshots from the direction of the dusitD2 hotel and paused.When the gunfire stopped, they moved slowly towards the hotel lobby, checking for ditches to dive into in case of a grenade attack. On the path they discovered a severed arm belonging to a suicide bomber who, half an hour earlier, had detonated his vest outside the Secret Garden restaurant.""I remember vividly it had a shiny ring on one of the fingers,"" Medic said.As they walked over the shattered glass of the hotel's front doors, Medic worried about a new threat: booby traps.Then they came under fire from automatic weapons.""We were sitting ducks,"" Medic said.He fired two shots as the group lay down suppressing fire and, one by one, ran back to their position behind the bank.At 4.02 p.m. Medic sent a message to the group: ""I've just been shot at in dusit.""By now a mix of Kenyan security teams had arrived, along with several other armed civilians.With the number and location of attackers still unknown, Medic joined a dozen maroon-bereted policemen in securing an adjacent office block, the Arlington building.They swept from floor to floor, kicking down glass doors and evacuating dozens of terrified office workers, coaxing them out from their hiding places under desks and in cupboards.On the fifth floor, they found the office to  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a French drinks manufacturer, protected by an impenetrable metal door.A voice from the other side refused to unlock it. Medic tried wrenching the handle but it came off in his hand. Eventually, the person on the other side relented.""As we opened it the (boss) was waiting with a big kitchen knife,"" Medic said. ""Some other staff had some other small kitchen knives.""Cowering behind them were 20 or 30 employees. ""I found that quite courageous.""Medic helped them out of the building and, with the dying of the light, the U.S.-trained commando unit known as SPEAR arrived and sealed the area off to civilians.That's when Medic's children started calling and bombarding him with messages.""They were all basically telling me off,"" Medic said. ""You are 30m away from terrorists,"" his 21-year-old daughter wrote at 6.30 p.m. ""Go home.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Jan 18, 2019 07:53AM ET",Elliott-target Pernod pledges to further improve governance,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the family-backed French spirits group under pressure from activist investor Elliott, will continue to improve its governance, it pledged on Friday. The statement to Reuters followed news reports the company was likely to make board changes, a move Jefferies analysts said would be an ""early win"" for Elliott. Pernod is due to hold a board meeting on Jan. 23.Elliott, which has become more active in Europe in recent years, said in December it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) to build a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod. Elliott has called on Pernod to raise profit margins and improve governance.In particular, it believes Pernod's 14-member board needs to be more diverse and have more independent voices, as many directors are linked to the Ricard family. Elliott does not have a board seat.So far, the two camps have described contacts, including one on Jan. 15, as cordial and constructive.A Pernod spokesman said on Friday that while ""we have not needed any external input as regards our continuous drive to seek to improve our governance,... we will continue, at the appropriate moment, to announce further changes, once they have been proposed, discussed and adopted by the board and its committee."" On Thursday, BFM Business reported that Pernod, which owns Absolut vodka and Martell cognac, planned to reshuffle its board in the coming weeks, with vice-chairman and former Pernod CEO Pierre Pringuet among those who could step down.Chief Executive Alexandre Ricard, who has already hired three independent directors and beefed up board expertise, is expected to present his new three-year strategy later this year, though some analysts expect Pernod to give some direction on margins alongside first-half earnings on Feb. 7.There are, however, doubts that Elliott can change much as the Ricard family controls 15 percent of Pernod's shares and 21 percent of voting rights, while long-time investor GBL owns a 7.5 percent stake and has said its supports the firm's strategy.The French state also warned in December it wanted ""big French companies to have stable and long-term shareholders"" and not to be ""subject to pressure from shareholders who want short-term profitability.""One unknown is why Elliott is so far taking a less confrontational approach with Pernod than with some other investments. Sources familiar with the activist's thinking say Elliott could be testing a new template for negotiations with other French companies.France is famous for protecting its companies against foreign takeovers. In 2005, it rushed to the support of food giant  Danone  (PA:DANO) in the face of a rumored bid from PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP), which never actually materialized.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

36,"Jan 16, 2019 08:27PM ET","Kenya hotel siege over, militants and at least 21 victims dead",nan,"By Katharine Houreld and Duncan MiririNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan security forces have killed all the Somali militants who stormed an upscale Nairobi hotel compound, taking at least 21 lives and forcing hundreds of people into terrifying escapes, the government said on Wednesday.Fifty people believed to have been in the complex remained unaccounted for on Wednesday afternoon, the Kenya Red Cross said, raising the possibility of a much higher final death toll.The bloody bodies of five attackers were broadcast across social media as President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the end of a 20-hour overnight siege that echoed a 2013 assault that killed 67 people in the Westgate shopping center in the same district.(Graphic showing the location and time of the Kenya militant attack at 14 Riverside drive: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ALAXKg)Somali group al Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate fighting to impose strict Islamic law, said they carried out the attack in revenge for U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. ""The security operation ... is over and all the terrorists eliminated,"" Kenyatta said in a televised national address, looking drained and grave.Kenyatta did not specify how many assailants there were, but CCTV clips showed at least five dressed in black, some sporting green grenade belts.One militant is seen in one clip waiting outside a restaurant before blowing himself up in a cloud of debris just after 3 p.m. (1200 GMT). Another explosion near the entrance gate, possibly a grenade, ignites three cars before four men stroll by firing assault rifles and split into two groups. One group entered a nearby office building, where they left a grenade in the lobby, a private security professional present during the attack told Reuters. Then they shot into elevators and offices as they searched for victims up to the sixth floor.The other group raked the restaurant with gunfire. Eventually the militants holed up on or near the top floor of the hotel, taking potshots at those fleeing, he said. BLOODSTAINED TABLESSixteen Kenyans - including a policeman - an American 9/11 survivor, and a British development worker were among the casualties, police chief Joseph Boinnet said. Three more victims were of African origin but their nationality was unknown, he added.Some victims had been dining in the Secret Garden restaurant and lay slumped at bloodstained tables, video seen by Reuters showed. In its two-page statement claiming responsibility, al Shabaab said: ""This operation ... (was) a response to the witless remarks of U.S. president, Donald Trump, and his declaration.""Asked about the group's claim, a White House National Security Council spokesman said in a statement: ""This senseless act is a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat radical Islamist terrorism.""Air strikes against the group have intensified under Trump, but Tuesday's attack showed that the insurgents retain the ability to strike outside Somalia's borders. Neighboring Kenya, a hub for multinationals and the United Nations, became a frequent target for al Shabaab after Kenya sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to try to create a buffer zone along its long, porous border.The dusitD2 complex is home to offices of international companies including Colgate Palmolive (N:CL),  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), Dow Chemical (N:DWDP) ad SAP (DE:SAPG), as well as the dusitD2 hotel, part of Thai group  Dusit Thani  (BK:DTC).Hiram Macharia, marketing executive at LG Electronics, said he grabbed a fire extinguisher and headed downstairs after the first blast.""Then we saw two of the attackers firing at the elevators and we turned back,"" he told Reuters outside the hotel. ""They were firing twice at each of the elevator doors and the two staircase doors on each floor as they walked up the building. One of them fired at our office doors, entered slightly and then moved on."" Macharia and some colleagues hid under desks, but one person ran to the roof and was shot dead there, he added.WESTGATE MISTAKES AVOIDEDSecurity forces appeared to have avoided some of the mistakes made during the 2013 attack, when police and soldiers shot at each other, then soldiers looted the Westgate mall. One private security worker at the scene said many of the explosions, especially those followed by a short burst of gunfire, were Kenyan special forces using small charges to blow open locked doors and clear rooms. About a dozen armed foreigners of various nationalities were also there, he said, including embassy staff and private security advisers trying to rescue clients. Mamadou Dia was on a business trip from Paris for STP Consultants when he ended up huddled in a room with Chinese and Canadian hotel guests and a waiter.""They told us by text that the police knew we were in that room and that they would come, and one and a half hours later, the police came to evacuate us,"" he said. As armed officers escorted them out, the attackers shot at them ""like snipers,"" he said, adding that police fired back.At nearby Chiromo morgue, the family of a 35-year-old man collapsed upon hearing a body had arrived with his identification papers. ""He is gone, he is gone,"" the father repeated into his phone as his mother wrapped a shawl around herself and wept.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

37,"Jan 15, 2019 08:17PM ET",Gunmen kill 15 in Kenya hotel compound attack claimed by Somali Islamists,nan,"By George Obulutsa and Baz RatnerNAIROBI (Reuters) - Gunmen blasted their way into a hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday, killing at least 15 people and sending workers diving under desks to escape an attack claimed by Somalia-based Islamist group al Shabaab.More than 12 hours after the assault began at Nairobi's upscale 14 Riverside Drive complex, bursts of gunfire and blasts were heard in the area, undermining government assurances everything was under control.The shots rang out at around 3:30 a.m. local time (0030 GMT) as a group of around 150 workers was escorted from a building where they had sought refuge. Many more remained inside and some needed first aid for gunshot wounds, a first responder told Reuters.By 1 a.m. local time, 15 bodies had arrived at Chiromo Mortuary and more were expected, an attendant told Reuters. Identification papers indicated that 11 were Kenyan, one was American and one was British, he said. The other two were not carrying documents.A U.S. State Department official confirmed one of the victims was American.""We can confirm that a U.S. citizen was killed in the attack,"" the official said without giving further details.Kenya's Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i had said at 11 p.m. that all buildings at the scene had been secured and scores of people evacuated. But he did not comment on the attackers' whereabouts and said security forces were still ""mopping up"". Nairobi is a major hub for expatriates and the compound targeted contained offices of various international companies, in an echo of a deadly 2013 assault on a Nairobi shopping center in the same neighborhood. ""The main door of the hotel was blown open and there was a human arm in the street severed from the shoulder,"" said Serge Medic, the Swiss owner of a security company who ran to the scene to help when he heard of the attack from his taxi driver. Medic, who was armed, entered the building with a policeman and two soldiers, he said, but they came under fire and retreated. An unexploded grenade lay in the lobby, he said. ""One man said he saw two armed men with scarves on their head and bandoliers of bullets,"" Medic told Reuters, as gunfire echoed in the background.Kenya has often been targeted by al Shabaab, who killed 67 people at the Westgate shopping center in 2013 and nearly 150 students at Garissa University in 2015. Al Shabaab says its attacks are revenge for Kenyan troops stationed inside Somalia, which has been riven by civil war since 1991. Earlier in the day, office workers had streamed from the complex, some jumping from windows. Security forces continued to escort small groups to safety into the evening, with some hustled into armored vehicles amid sporadic gunfire. Foreign security advisers at the site scrambled to make sure their clients were safe.GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONSKenyan police chief Joseph Boinnet said the attack began around 3 p.m. with an explosion targeting cars outside a bank followed by a detonation from a suicide bomber in the hotel lobby. As he spoke, a Reuters reporter on the scene reported heavy gunfire, then an explosion shortly afterwards.Surveillance video showed three attackers dressed in black running across the parking lot at 3:30 p.m. shortly followed by a fourth. At least two of the men were wearing green scarves in the close-up footage. One appeared to be wearing a green belt with grenades on it.Two Kenyans in their early 30s working with governance consultants Adam Smith International were among the dead, a family member said. Both had young families, she said.A Spanish national was among the injured, a Spanish diplomat told Reuters. The U.S. Embassy had offered assistance, a State Department official said, adding all American diplomats were safe. A woman shot in the leg was carried out of the complex, and several men emerged covered in blood. Some office workers climbed out of windows. Many told Reuters they had to leave colleagues behind, still huddled under their desks. ""There's a grenade in the bathroom,"" one officer yelled as police rushed out from one building. Geoffrey Otieno, who works at a beauty salon in the complex, said he heard a loud bang from something thrown inside the building, then saw shattered glass.""We hid until we were rescued,"" he said.Meanwhile, Simon Crump, an Australian who works for an international firm in the complex, barricaded himself inside a spare room with two other people. They waited there for about 2-1/2 hours for help to arrive, their minds racing.""You’re hiding under a desk trying to figure out what’s going on, and you just don’t know, as there’s so much misinformation,"" he said.When soldiers finally reached the group, they instructed them to put their phones away and put their hands in the air as they made their way to safety. INTERNATIONAL COMPANIESAl Shabaab, which wants to overthrow the weak, United Nations-backed Somali government and impose strict Islamic law, quickly said it was responsible. ""We are behind the attack in Nairobi. The operation is going on,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group's military operations spokesman, told Reuters by telephone in Somalia. According to its website, 14 Riverside is home to local offices of international companies including Colgate Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP),  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and SAP, as well as the dusitD2 hotel, part of Thai group Dusit Thani. Kenya is a base for hundreds of diplomats, aid workers, businessmen and others operating around East Africa. The Australian Embassy is across the road from the compound.""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives,"" a woman working in a bank in the complex said, adding she heard two explosions. Kenyan television featured appeals for blood from local hospitals and showed police cordoning off the route to ensure vehicles could move quickly. Red Cross ambulances ferried victims away.Kenyan troops, concentrated in southern Somalia, originally entered the country to try to create a buffer zone along the shared border. They now form part of an African Union peacekeeping force.The attack took place as a Kenyan court prepares to sentence four men accused of aiding the Westgate mall attack.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

38,"Jan 14, 2019 01:14PM ET",Pernod Ricard to meet activist Elliott ahead of earnings update: sources,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Maiya KeidanPARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) will meet activist hedge fund Elliott this month as the family-backed spirits firm faces pressure to improve its margins, sources familiar with the situation said.Although chief executive Alexandre Ricard is expected to present his new strategy plan later this year, some analysts expect Pernod Ricard to give some direction on margins when it publishes first-half earnings on Feb. 7.Billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott, which is being advised by French business and political establishment insider Alain Minc, is hopeful that Ricard will deliver some of the changes it has proposed, including improving investor returns, one source said.The activist fund, which has become more active in Europe in recent years, revealed in December that it had spent around 930 million euros ($1.1 billion) building a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod Ricard and called on it to improve profit margins and governance.Elliott, which the first source said views its dialogue with Pernod Ricard as constructive, has called for some 500 million euros of cost cuts, suggested options such as merging with another spirits company and said its board needed more independence as many directors have Ricard family links.But Ricard had inherited ""a very, very heavy structure in terms of inertia and culture"", the same source said.""The CEO, no matter how good he is or how good his intentions are, cannot single-handedly change the direction of a company or improve its culture,"" the source added.A top-20 investor in Pernod Ricard cited its share price as evidence the company was moving in the right direction under Ricard, the 46-year-old grandson of the company's founder, who took over in 2015 and made sales growth his top priority.""I often think the market is the best judge of CEO performance... (looking at) the forward PE (price-earnings) of Pernod and arguably its best peer,  Diageo  (LON:DGE), Pernod always traded at a discount, but is now at the premium,"" he said.FAMILY GROUP Elliott met Ricard, who is expected to attend this month's meeting, on Nov. 22 after an annual meeting at which he said he was preparing a three-year strategic plan to accelerate growth.There have been follow-up technical meetings between the two sides, but some doubt that Elliott can change much as the Ricard family controls 15 percent of Pernod Ricard's shares and 21 percent of voting rights, while long-time investor GBL owns a 7.5 percent stake and has said its supports the firm's strategy.Meanwhile, the French government warned in December it wanted ""big French companies to have stable and long-term shareholders"" and did not want them to be ""subject to pressure from shareholders who want short-term profitability""While Pernod has said it valued ""constructive input"" from shareholders, it has defended its long-term value strategy, which, helped by a recovery in Chinese demand for premium spirits, saw sales growth rise to 6 percent in 2017/18.There have been cost cuts under its existing efficiency plan, but some analysts have said more could be done at Pernod Ricard, which had a profit margin of 26.23 percent in 2017/18 against rival Diageo's 31.4 percent.""Already you have a good company to begin with, you could make it a lot better,"" one source said.With sales growing again, Pernod Ricard has said it is time to combine short-term profitability and long-term sustainable growth, prompting analysts at Liberum to say:""We believe the group will set targets to exceed 30 percent operating profit margins by 2021.""($1 = 0.8678 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

However, it said Pernod has lost market share across key segments and has underperformed its peers with respect to operating margins and total shareholder return. It also said Pernod's M&A track record was disappointing, particularly its 2008 purchase of Absolut vodka. ""An environment of inadequate corporate governance and a lack of outside perspectives have contributed to this underperformance,"" Elliott said, suggesting that ""operational and governance improvements would allow Pernod to unlock much of the value that the company is capable of delivering"".Pernod Ricard was born from the 1975 merger of two French anise-based spirits makers - Pernod, founded in 1805 and Ricard, founded in 1932. The Ricard family remains the company's largest shareholder, with a 15.19 percent stake, according to Refinitiv data. SHARING ITS VIEWSThe investor said it had written to the company’s board ""to share its analysis and views on value creation"".Neither Pernod nor Elliott were available for immediate comment on Wednesday morning. In October, Pernod reported a jump in first-quarter sales, but also warned that this level of sales growth would moderate as the financial year progressed.Pernod shares have risen by roughly 7 percent so far in 2018, beating a 5 percent drop in the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Food & Beverages Index (SX3P) and a 4 percent rise in the shares of  Diageo  (L:DGE).""Given strong recent share price performance and family involvement, we do not expect this to result in a significant change of strategy for the company,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note. ""However, it could lead to greater emphasis on margin acceleration, in particular from full year 20 onwards.""Jefferies calculates that Pernod had total shareholder return of 105 percent over the last 10 years, whereas Diageo returned 145 percent,  Campari  (MI:CPRI) 181 percent and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) 220 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In Britain, the pound rose 0.5 percent and the FTSE (FTSE) gained 0.7 percent as expectations grew that Prime Minister Theresa May would survive a leadership challenge - a result that would reassert her authority and potentially diminish the chance of a chaotic Brexit.Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said he expected a May victory that would probably benefit sterling. Amid the general upbeat mood, trading updates from retailers weighed on the overall sector which was the only one trading in negative territory, down 0.2 percent. ""It looks like another shocker of a day for UK retail as  Inditex , Superdry and Dixons Carphone shares have slumped sharply in opening trade"", wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Shares of Zara owner Inditex (MC:ITX) fell 4.5 percent as sales and profit growth came below market expectations. A profit warning for British fashion retailer Superdry (L:SDRY) saw its shares lose close to 30 percent of their market value. Also in Britain, Dixons Carphone (L:DC), the electricals and mobile phone retailer, lost close to 10 percent after reporting a statutory first-half pretax loss of 440 million pounds after booking 490 million pounds of exceptional charges, mainly related to goodwill.It wasn't all gloom for retailers however with Belgium's  Colruyt  (BR:COLR) jumping close to 10 percent after better than expected results.

It survived the collapse in 1990 of its U.S. investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert amid a scandal over its promotion of highly leveraged buyouts and ""junk bonds"".His career started when he inherited his family business, trading in nails, and set out to acquire a string of steel businesses around his home city of Charleroi after World War Two. He left school to run the business aged 17.""Albert Frere, honorary chairman and co-controlling shareholder of the company, passed away today,"" GBL said in a statement on its website on Monday.""For more than three decades, under his leadership, GBL became one of the largest holdings in Europe. His professional and human qualities have deeply marked our group.""Through the group, Frere held significant stakes in some of Europe's biggest companies, including Adidas (DE:ADSGn),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), LafargeHolcim (S:LHN) and  Total  (PA:TOTF).Often Frere played a role as a consolidator, where he traded a large stake in a smaller company against a small stake in a larger company. This was the case in the sale of Belgian energy company PetroFina to Total, media group RTL to Bertelsmann, or in the giant cement merger between Lafarge and  Holcim .Together with Bernard Arnaud of France's LVMH luxury group, Frere, who was made a baron by the Belgian king, owned acclaimed French wine estate Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-Emilion near Bordeaux. But he himself never moved far from his birthplace near Charleroi, at the heart of Belgium's coal and steel belt.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

""To date there is no evidence that the legalization of cannabis will have an impact on the consumption of premium spirits. We continue to monitor it,"" Alexandre Ricard told the annual shareholders meeting. ""We must give ourselves 12-18 months to be in a position to assess it."" Eight U.S. states, including California and Nevada, have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and Canada became the first industrialized nation to legalize recreational cannabis last month.Some studies show consumers would buy the drug instead of alcohol if it was freely available.Rival Constellation Brands (N:STZ) has bought a near 10 percent stake in Canadian cannabis maker Canopy Growth Corp to take advantage of any future boom, as more jurisdictions consider legalizing the drug.  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) is also closely watching the fast-growing marijuana drinks market for a possible entry that would expand the world’s largest soft drink maker’s ambitions further away from sugary sodas.Alexandre Ricard also told shareholders that the world's second-largest spirits market after  Diageo  (L:DGE) was working on a new three-year strategy plan. This comes after Pernod Ricard, which makes Absolut vodka and Martell cognac, exceeded in fiscal year 2017/18 the medium-term sales growth goals it had set in June 2015, the year Ricard took over as chairman and CEO.Pernod Ricard delivered underlying group sales growth of 6 percent in the year ended June 30, driven by a 17 percent jump in sales in China. This compared with a medium-term target of 4-5 percent sales growth.""Our goal is to consolidate that acceleration, to deliver a durable and profitable growth,"" Ricard told shareholders, without providing new targets.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

49,"Sep 07, 2018 09:42PM ET",Australia's drought could produce a corker vintage,nan,"By Tom Westbrook and Jonathan BarrettGRIFFITH/BAROSSA, Australia (Reuters) - If Australia's big dry has a silver lining, it'll be worth cellaring, according to vintners, who are scrambling to irrigate vines while preparing for a smaller but sweeter vintage.Spring, when vine buds burst into fruit and flower, has come with much of Australia's east gripped by a drought that has turned usually fertile pastures barren.Winemakers say the next few weeks could make or break the A$6.2 billion ($4.4 billion) industry's season, with soils across three quarters of the continent's east classified by the weather bureau as dry or very dry.If vines stay thirsty, yields will suffer. But the grapes that survive should hold a stronger flavor, more sugar, and might fetch a higher price for their superior quality, industry participants say.""No rain means the berries are much smaller ... if the grapes or berries are smaller, their intensity is much higher, so they're much richer,"" said Vince Salpietro, managing director of high-end Australian cellar and wine merchant Grand Cru.""But there is a point where if there is no rain at all, the vine really, really struggles along and the vines will effectively shut down and not produce anything.""While drought years can produce small but great vintages, grape growers and winemakers say it is difficult to lift bottle prices accordingly, and with hardly any rainfall since last summer they are desperate to dampen the soil. In South Australia's premier red wine region, Barossa grape grower Greg Knight said he needs good rainfalls soon, or the vines won't shoot evenly.""We are totally reliant on weather and climate here - we have some supplementary water available via the dams but it's only minimal,"" he told Reuters, while taking a short break from hand-pruning the vines.Grape growers will be looking to extract a higher price from winemakers for their sweeter grapes to offset a reduced yield.According to Rabobank wine analyst Hayden Higgins, while it is too early to predict market movements with much accuracy, a volume shortfall could prove tricky for both sides of the deal. ""The ability to negotiate price is probably limited from a grower's perspective,"" he said, referring to the fixed-contracts many are locked into.If yields are significantly depleted, spot prices for leftover crops could jump, cutting into winemaker margins, Higgins said.Australia's largest wine exporter,  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd  (AX:TWE) told Reuters it was too early in the season to forecast the impact. No. 3 winemaker  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP) said it does not expect the drought to effect grape supply ""at this stage"".SCRAMBLE TO IRRIGATENot all Australian vineyards are suffering the effects of the extended winter drought. Australia's west coast wine country has been spared the dry weather, and irrigated vineyards in the east also have a cushion against the kind of steep production shortfalls seen last season in South Africa and Europe. Australian growers are also not subject to the strict controls on irrigation which apply to some of Europe's oldest wine regions as a check on supply.But even irrigated vineyards can't fully compensate for mother nature, especially in the drought-savaged Hunter region of New South Wales.Hunter Valley winemakers speak reverently of drought-year vintages in 1991, 2006 and 2007 but Col Peterson said he has never turned the taps on so early in 45 years growing grapes in the region. Peterson plans to use his entire water allocation on the land over the four months from August.""This time of year it is critical that we water the grapes,"" he told Reuters, though adding he already expects yields will drop.""I expect significant price rises, especially for reds this year. In a good season you make a bit more; a bad season, yes it costs you a bit more but you've got to balance it out."" Further inland at Griffith, where duststorms are raking over dry fields, growers and winemakers are hoping the worst drought in living memory produces a once-in-a-lifetime vintage.""In general, you would expect your yields to be lower,"" said Lorraine Brewer, owner of vineyard and winery Yarran Wines.""In saying that, you often get fantastic quality wine in drought times ... so if you're starting a cellar and we have a dry (harvest) this would be a really good year to put some stuff aside.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Recommendation from celebrities and social media influencers who have millions of followers is a growing marketing strategy for brands, but the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that such endorsements could mislead customers.It said it had seen posts that appeared to promote items or offer a celebrity's personal endorsement of a product, without it being clear whether the post had been paid for by the brand in question. ""If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or a holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it,"" said George Lusty, the CMA’s Senior Director for Consumer Protection.""So it's really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand."" The CMA said it had written to a range of famous people to gather more information about their business agreements with brands, and also wanted the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation.Consumer giants such as  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Mars have all spent money on so-called influencers to promote products. Brands will pay anywhere from $10,000 to more than $100,000 for a single social media post, depending on the size, engagement and loyalty of the person's followers, and Unilever said it accounted for ""tens of millions"" of its 7.7 billion euro marketing last year.The most famous can earn even more. Reality TV stars Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, singer Selena Gomez and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo are the top-paid celebrities per post on Instagram, earning up to 1 million dollars a post, according to social media analytics firm HopperHQ.Their posts are often tagged ""paid partnership with"", ""#sponsored"" or ""#ad"" to indicate that the stars have been paid by the brands in question.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

57,"Jul 03, 2018 12:07PM ET","Firing fake pineapples, Pernod uses 'influencers' to drive sales",nan,"By Martinne Geller and Kate HoltonLONDON/CANNES, France (Reuters) - This spring, Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Malibu Rum paid American singer Nick Jonas to host a competition in Vietnam that began with 33 Instagram stars battling to catch fake pineapples while flying off a giant waterslide into the sea. In one month alone, videos and pictures from the ""Malibu Games"" were viewed 2.4 billion times online, showing the potential for so-called ""influencer marketing"" to reach social media-mad consumers that may overlook older, traditional brands.This kind of advertising, where celebrities and popular bloggers earn money by posting about products, has developed over the past five years on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter (N:TWTR), Facebook (O:FB) and YouTube.Influencer marketing found early popularity with beauty, fast fashion and fitness brands but has now spread across the spectrum, even though some analysts question whether it actually works. It accounted for about $1 billion a year of advertising spend on Instagram alone last year, according to influencer marketing agency Mediakix, which predicts the entire market could reach $10 billion by 2020; still tiny in the near $600 billion ad realm, but growing fast. Thibaut Portal, leader of Pernod's global media hub, said influencer marketing was playing a ""growing and key role"" in the French spirit maker's campaigns and was in use on all its major brands.Influencers give Pernod more options for spending marketing dollars online, an important destination for liquor companies which have restrictions on television advertising in some places, such as France.Sometimes brands use social media stars with millions of followers to drive awareness of a brand, but other times pick ""micro-influencers"" with thousands of followers who, as experts in their industry, can impact choices. ""We are not interested in working with big, massive influencers with four or five million followers (when) the week after, the same influencer is going to post a picture of a washing machine,"" Portal said.The rapid growth of influencer marketing shows how the broader ad industry is changing, as brands struggle to reach consumers in a world of fragmented content on the internet, now the biggest platform ahead of TV. Brands will pay anywhere from $10,000 to more than $100,000 for a single social media post, experts say, depending on the size, engagement and loyalty of the person's followers. This can buy online content more cheaply than traditional advertising. Pernod is far from alone in using the technique, with fellow consumer giants like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Mars all testing the waters. Pernod declined to say how much of its 1.7 billion euro marketing budget it spent on influencers, but Unilever said it accounted for ""tens of millions"" of its 7.7 billion euro marketing last year. However some analysts question whether a viral video clip seen millions of times actually lifts sales. Influencers can also artificially enhance their audience numbers - which often dictate their fees - by purchasing fake followers, machine-generated profiles fueled by ""bots"". This was highlighted last month when Unilever said it would cut ties with influencers that buy followers.""If it was a child before, it's a teenager now, and it's got to grow up quickly,"" Neil Waller, co-founder of influencer marketing platform Whalar, said about the fledgling advertising area. CUT OUT MIDDLEMANPernod credits Malibu's social media presence for helping to invigorate the brand, whose sales volume grew in each of the past three years, according to researchers IWSR, after falling the previous two.The Malibu Games mostly featured people whose notoriety centers on social media. Besides singer Jonas (15.4 million followers on Instagram), participants included Sierra Dallas (1.2 million), Alba Paul Ferrer (878,000) and Rory Kramer (483,000). The influencers posted about their experiences of the three-day event, including enough short video clips to make up over four hours of footage. A teaser video was watched 10 million times, the company said.Getting creative content directly from influencers also allows brands to skirt the middleman, traditional ad agencies owned by the likes of WPP (L:WPP), Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG). Nonetheless, agencies are using the tactic too. ""We're deeply involved in it, when creative agencies launch campaigns there will be an influencer element in it,"" Jonathan Nelson, digital boss of the world's second largest ad company Omnicom said. ""These are tailored experiences for you.""Research by Accenture found that 53 percent of consumers aged 18 to 34 were loyal to brands that partnered with social influencers, compared with just 8 percent for those over 55. According to e-commerce analytics firm L2, 72 percent of Instagram users report making purchase decisions based on something that they saw on the site.   Unilever Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed said he expected influencers to take a growing part of his budget. ""We see it as a very powerful vehicle ... creating very authentic real-time content at a much lower price,"" Weed told Reuters. ""The way it penetrates the culture, I really do think it's going to be a big and vibrant market."" Mars, another major advertiser, is also a fan. It divides its ad budget, with 80 percent going on proven campaigns and media, 15 percent in areas that are unproven but where there is a method of measurement, and 5 percent on total experimentation. Influencer marketing falls into both the biggest and the second-biggest categories depending on the type of campaign. Goat, a nearly three-year old agency that works with around 40,000 influencers, helped recruit members for the Malibu Games, opting for stars with a broad, young appeal. ""The key is can they influence their audience,"" co-founder Arron Shepherd said. ""With Malibu we're looking to make it the number one drink that people think of in the summer.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It's about Australia's national sovereignty,"" Ciobo said at an event at the country's Parliament in Canberra.""I think those who have attempted to portray it as being about the bilateral relationship with China have done Australia a great injustice,"" he said.Mirroring similar rules in the United States, the Australian measures will require lobbyists for foreign countries to register, and makes them liable for criminal prosecution if they are deemed to be interfering in domestic affairs.China denies allegations of meddling in Australian affairs, and has accused Canberra of harboring a ""Cold War mentality"".Ciobo's comments could help to stem further damage to the relationship between the two countries, an analyst said.""It is a step in the right direction for creating some space to rebuild the relationship,"" said Merriden Varrall, Director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.The widening diplomatic rift between Australia and China has affected Australian wine exports, including products from Treasury Wine Estates (AX:TWE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which have faced delays getting through Chinese customs.Despite Australian efforts to ease the curbs, wine is only trickling into the industry's most lucrative market, expected to be worth more than A$1 billion ($735 million) this year.Australian cattle graziers and citrus growers also fear they are being sidelined by China as a result of the row.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

China will not want to again be singled out,"" said James Laurenceson, deputy director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.Ahead of the legislation's expected passage, Chinese telecom firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd mounted a lobbying campaign to secure its participation in a 5G telecommunications roll-out and to allay Australian fears that the company poses a security risk.The foreign interference legislation was approved by Australia's House of Representatives on Tuesday. It is expected to pass in the Senate where the main opposition Labor Party has said it will support the legislation after several revisions in recent months.Another law banning foreign political donations has yet to be introduced in the lower house.Turnbull acknowledged in April that relations with China, which included two-way trade of A$170 billion ($125.60 billion) last year, had soured because of the legislation. Six Australian wines, including the world's biggest-listed winemaker Treasury Wine Estates Ltd, and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), have faced delays in getting products through Chinese customs.Despite Australian efforts to ease the curbs, wine continues to struggle to penetrate the industry's most lucrative market, expected to be worth more than A$1 billion this year.Australian cattle graziers and citrus growers also fear they are being sidelined by China as a result of the row.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Australia has longstanding concerns about Huawei. In 2012 it banned the company from supplying its massive National Broadband Network, and in May Canberra committed millions of dollars to ensure Huawei did not build an internet cable between Australia and the Solomon Islands.A decision on 5G would come amid a low in Beijing-Canberra relations. Canberra is preparing to pass laws designed to limit Beijing's influence in domestic affairs following criticism by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull late last year that Beijing was meddling in its affairs. Huawei said in the letter it operates in 170 countries, abiding by national laws and guidelines. Citing 5G investments in Britain, Canada and New Zealand, the company said those governments had taken up its offer to evaluate the company's technology to make sure it abided by cybersecurity protocols.Australia's Attorney-General Christian Porter refused to comment on the specifics of Huawei's letter but said the letter would be seen in a different light once the country's Foreign Interference Bill, which will require individuals to declare links with foreign governments, is passed.""(If) you are acting on behalf of what we would define as a foreign government-related entity, and you're lobbying government, you are trying to affect an outcome for government decisions or you're trying to affect an outcome of an Australian democratic process, that's fine but we simply want it done with full transparency,"" Porter told reporters in Canberra.The Foreign Interference Bill could pass Australia's Parliament as early as this week.""It won't be great for the relationship if Australia bans Huawei but it won't come as a huge surprise,"" said Merriden Virrall, director at Australian think tank the Lowy Institute.""What is important is how Australia articulates it. Australia can't make sweeping statements about great foreign powers. That will determine the response from China."" Alienating China could herald additional trade restrictions from Beijing, analysts said, as six Australian wines, including some produced by Treasury Wine Estates and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), continue to suffer in shipping supplies to China.Australia's wine exports to China were worth A$848 million ($631.17 million) last year and are forecast to top A$1 billion in 2018, government figures show. Some analysts say those figures now look optimistic. ""The bilateral relationship isn't in a great place, and the government's announcement will be another major pothole,"" said Danielle Cave, a former analyst at an Australian security intelligence agency, the Office of National Assessments.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

62,"Jun 17, 2018 10:58PM ET",Fraying Australia and China relations face testing times in Canberra,nan,"By Colin PackhamSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's relationship with top trading partner China faces a testing two weeks as Canberra prepares to pass laws designed to limit Beijing's influence in domestic affairs amid pressure on some of its fastest growing exports.The fallout from proposed foreign interference laws will likely be exacerbated by an expected ban on China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] from supplying equipment for the soon-to-be built 5G mobile broadband network on national security grounds.Australian winemakers who say their goods are being held up at Chinese ports have urged the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to resolve diplomatic tensions blamed for the trade obstacles that some fear could spread to other major exports.HOW DID AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA SOUR?Barely two years into a landmark Free Trade Agreement with China that fueled an export boom, Turnbull cited Chinese ""meddling"" as justification for new laws aimed at limiting foreign influence.Turnbull told parliament late last year he was concerned by reports of Chinese Communist Party interference in Australia's media, universities and politics. These included close ties and donations by Chinese interests made to an opposition lawmaker, who later resigned over the issue. The center-right government has been preparing laws to ban foreign political donations and better disclose links between lobbyists and the foreign interests they work for. A changed definition of espionage has also been proposed which would capture more activities.""China objected to being singled out by Turnbull,"" said James Laurenceson, an expert on the two nations’ economic ties, at the University of Technology in Sydney.China denies accusations of meddling in Australia's affairs, and has accused Canberra of bias that has poisoned relations.WHAT PROMPTED AUSTRALIA'S ASSERTIVENESS?Australia had until recently sought to navigate a path between its long-time security ally, the United States, and China, which took nearly 30 percent of all exports from Australia last year.The balance has become more difficult as Australian security agencies warned of increased cybersecurity and a heightened risk of political interference. Beijing's defiance of international demands to cease militarizing the South China Sea has also fueled tensions.Peter Jennings, who served as an adviser to former Prime Minister John Howard, said the strategic landscape had quickly changed Turnbull's pro-China outlook that he had articulated when he came to power in 2015. Questions about China's involvement in Australia became more vocal that year with the lease of a commercial and military port in the northern city of Darwin to a Chinese firm said to have close ties to China's military. Washington was said to have raised concerns about the deal, near a base where it stations more than 1,500 marines.HOW HAS CHINA RESPONDED?China, a major importer of Australia agricultural and commodity products, initially limited its response to diplomatic protests. That changed last month as Chinese customs began to delay shipments of six Australian wines, including those produced by Treasury Wine Estates and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP).Australia’s wine exports to China were worth A$848 million last year and are forecast to top A$1 billion in 2018, government figures show. Some analysts now say those figures now look optimistic. China says imports of Australian wine are being handled ""according to normal procedures"". WHY ARE THE NEXT FEW WEEKS CRITICAL?Despite mounting economic pressure, Australia could pass the foreign interference legislation as early as this week.The first part of the new laws, which will require the registration of individuals with links to foreign governments, is the centerpiece legislation of Canberra's China hawks, who argue it is addressing warnings highlighted by security officials.""The foreign interference legislation is long overdue and addresses prior weaknesses or loopholes in Australian law, which had to be strengthened to suit modern circumstances,"" said John Lee, former principal advisor to Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.The foreign interference legislation may coincide with an expected ban on China's Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment for the soon-to-be built mobile broadband networks. Huawei was banned in 2012 from supplying Australia's massive National Broadband Network, and in May, Australia committed millions of dollars to ensure Huawei did not build an internet cable between Australia and the Solomon Islands.Australia has not publicly explained its objection, but a source familiar with the Solomon Islands deal said Canberra was concerned that China could jeopardize its national security, by having access to Australian telecommunications infrastructure.Australia, like the United States, worries Huawei is de facto controlled by China, raising fears that sensitive infrastructure will fall into the hands of Beijing.Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations, insisting it is an independent company.WHO CAN EASE THE TENSIONS?Australia has made some modest attempts to ease tensions, although the government's tough stance has played well locally with many voters. Australia's Minister for Trade Steven Ciobo has sought to woo China and Bishop has sought a meeting with officials in China, a request that sources say Beijing is yet to respond.Several analysts say Beijing wants a higher-ranking official, namely Turnbull, to lead efforts to mend ties.Turnbull will on Tuesday deliver a keynote speech to Chinese business leaders, an address that Australia's trade industry hopes will balance the country's security and commercial interests.""Australia can express any security concerns but we must be conscious of the potential impact it has on trade,"" said Tony Battaglene, chief executive of industry body the Wine Federation of Australia.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Jun 13, 2018 12:27PM ET",Exclusive: Pernod Ricard wines delayed at Chinese ports amid strained ties with Australia - sources,nan,"By Colin PackhamSYDNEY (Reuters) - Wine shipments from Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Australian business have been held up at Chinese ports, two sources told Reuters, the first foreign company to be harmed by a deterioration in relations between Australia and China.Six Australian wine companies have faced delays at Chinese customs since Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull complained of Chinese political interference late last year, straining ties between the two trading partners, a senior government official said this month. The listed French company  Pernod Ricard  owns the big-selling Australian wine brand Jacob's Creek. Australia has accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs and is introducing foreign interference laws. China has denied any such activity.""Pernod Ricard through its ownership of Jacob's Creek has been impacted by China's restrictions,"" said a government source briefed on the issue, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Pernod Ricard's head office in France acknowledged that there had been an impact but declined to go into details. ""We experienced some delays in China and we are actively working to resolve the issue,"" a spokesman said. ""Our business performance in the country is not impacted by this minor incident.""In recent months,  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd  (AX:TWE) and McWilliams Wines disclosed they were experiencing problems at Chinese customs. They and Pernod Ricard joined several other companies for an emergency meeting with government officials last week, a government source said, to urge the government to break the impasse with China over trade restrictions. China's customs have not responded to faxes requesting comment on the Australian complaints of delays. Pernod Ricard, which manufactures and sells various alcoholic drinks including Absolut Vodka and Martell cognac, does not publish sales records of Jacob's Creek wines to China. But this month, it said China accounted for about 9 percent of its global sales of 9 billion euros ($10.57 billion). The Chinese delays have cast a shadow over an otherwise golden period for Australian wine exports, which are forecast to be worth more than A$1 billion in 2018, government figures show, compared with A$848 million ($641.43 million) last year.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

An estimated $759 million worth of spirits exports are the target of tariffs from the country's trading partners, which, if imposed, would severely harm producers, farmers and industries associated with the spirits business, the U.S. Distilled Spirits Council said in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.The trade group estimated that 65 percent of global U.S. whiskey would take a hit if the European Union, Canada, Turkey and/or China retaliated.""The imposition of tariffs on these products by our major trading partners threatens to seriously impede the export progress that has benefited our sector and created jobs across the country,"" Clarkson Hine, interim president and chief executive officer of Distilled Spirits Council said in a letter.The United States has placed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from countries including the EU, Canada, Mexico and China.In response, Mexico on Tuesday imposed tariffs on American products ranging from steel to pork and bourbon.The trade body represents companies such as  Diageo  PLC (L:DGe),  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP) and Brown-Forman Corp (N:BFb).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

70,"May 25, 2018 09:31AM ET","Aperitif, anyone? Spirits firms chase cocktail for growth",nan,"By Francesca Landini, Maria Pia Quaglia and Martinne GellerMILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Drinks companies are converging on an unusual cocktail recipe: less alcohol.In bars from London to New York, sales of ""aperitifs"" such as Aperol, Lillet and Martini Rosso are growing rapidly as younger drinkers in particular opt for lower-alcohol concoctions over stronger traditional cocktail spirits like vodka.As a result companies such as Italy's Campari, Britain's  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and France's  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) are snapping up aperitif brands or launching new marketing drives for existing ones. Global sales volumes of spirit-based aperitifs - which are half the strength of regular spirits - rose 7.4 percent last year, while vodka fell 6 percent, brandy declined 1.3 percent and rum sales lost 0.8 percent, according to new data published on Thursday by beverage market research firm IWSR. Campari, Pernod Ricard and Diageo executives all told Reuters they viewed the rise of these lower-strength spirits, which have their roots in Italy and France, as a long-term trend and a potentially important future driver of growth. The rising popularity is partly fueled by young people wanting to stay more in control and having a keen awareness of their social-media image, according to market researchers and drinks companies. It comes against the backdrop of stagnating consumption of alcohol in much of the developed world.However aperitifs still represent a sliver of the overall spirits market, slightly over 2 percent of sales volumes, and there is also no guarantee that the rise in sales will represent more than a passing fad in big markets like the United States.Campari, whose drinks cabinet has historically been skewed towards aperitifs, has a head-start and is reaping the benefits with Aperol, the world's best-selling aperitif brand. Aperol sales - in decline just five years ago - leapt 19.5 percent last year, even as the firm's top vodka brand SKYY fell 3.5 percent.In the United States - the biggest source of drink industry profits - Aperol has had the strongest growth of any spirit over the past year with a 59 percent leap, according to Nielsen researchers. Campari CEO Bob Kunze-Concewitz told Reuters that per-capita consumption of Aperol in its core markets of Italy and Austria was still 100 times greater than in the United States. ""This gives us an indication of the room for growth,"" he said. After an advertising campaign last summer in the New York area, Campari plans a similar drive in other areas of the United States, targeting big cities and high-end bar and restaurants. The group has expanded its U.S. distribution network and sales team over the past two years. RIVALS CRASH PARTY While Campari is market leader in aperitifs, it is a much smaller player in the wider industry than Diageo and Pernod Ricard, the two biggest companies by sales. Now the two big fish are looking to challenge Aperol, a bright orange liqueur usually mixed into a ""spritz"" with prosecco and soda.Pernod Ricard told Reuters it was marketing Lillet more aggressively outside its home market of France. The wine-based aperitif has taken off in Germany and is now growing by a double-digit percentage rate in Western Europe and North America, it added. Diageo, the world's largest drinks group, dipped into the aperitif market with its purchase of craft vermouth brand Belsazar in March.Both Diageo and Pernod Ricard told Reuters they were looking at further investments in the lower-alcohol spirit bracket.Bernstein analyst Trevor Stirling said they had a long way to go to catch up with Campari in this field. ""Other people are experimenting, but nothing yet has really achieved the scale of anything close to Aperol.""There is no evidence that drinking lower-strength drinks means a drinker will consume less alcohol overall, analysts say. One study, published last month by the University of Cambridge, suggests that labeling alcoholic drinks as lower-strength could encourage people to drink more. The drinks companies do not market their aperitifs as lower-strength or healthier alternatives, but do say a big draw for drinkers is that they contain less alcohol than regular spirits. ""People want drinks that are lighter so they can stay in control,"" said David Gates, head of Diageo Futures, a unit involved in catching new trends. PRICING AND MARGINS While aperitifs - which typically contain 10-20 percent of alcohol - are usually cheaper to produce than premium full-strength spirits, they also sell for less.For this reason the margins on aperitifs are similar to those on full-proof spirits, once differences in marketing and advertising spends are stripped away, according to an industry source.At  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), Britain's biggest supermarket, a 70 centilitre (cl) bottle of Aperol was recently on promotion for 10 pounds ($13.40), down from its usual 15 pounds, with a bigger 1 liter bottle of Bacardi's Martini Rosso selling for 9 pounds. Similar promotions saw 70 cl bottles of Absolut Vodka and Tanqueray gin sell for 16 pounds, and Jack Daniel's whiskey 26 pounds. Spirits companies like Campari, Diageo, Pernod Ricard and have profit margins in the region of 60 percent, according to Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg.For British pub owner Tom Rowell, aperitifs offer a less raucous night out.The Bristol-based businessman decided to open an aperitif bar alongside his pub last year in the southwestern city.""Today I sell more Aperol than gin, and beer accounts for about 40 percent of my sales compared with 60 percent in the past,"" said Rowell who took up the new venture after visiting Italy where pre-dinner drinks and snacks are an evening ritual.His downtown bar, Noto, attracts mainly young professionals.""Eating and drinking out in Britain is becoming more and more of a luxury, so people who are doing it care more about quality than they do about quantity,"" Rowell told Reuters. ""They are not going out to get drunk, but to socialize.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

73,"May 01, 2018 02:10AM ET",Euro's boom spells corporate gloom for region's exporters,nan,"By Alasdair Pal and Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - A strong euro has helped U.S. companies extend their sales outperformance over Europe to multi-year highs in the first quarter, according to Reuters data - though experts expect the trend to begin to reverse later this year.Renewed confidence in the European economy and persistent weakness in the dollar have driven the euro up 16 percent against the U.S. currency from the first quarter last year to the end of March 2018.That means euro zone companies reporting first-quarter earnings for 2018 have seen dollar revenues shrink by roughly a sixth in a year. Some 74 percent of companies on the U.S. S&P 500 that have reported in first quarter have beaten analysts' estimates for sales, compared with just 22 percent on Europe's Stoxx 600, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/.The spread between the two is the highest since I/B/E/S/ began collating comparable data in the first quarter of 2011.(Graphic: Euro boom hurts continent's exporters - https://reut.rs/2JGfoNp)Exporting heavyweights  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Continental (DE:CONG) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) have all reported hits to their results from the strong euro in the last week.Euro zone exporters suffer from a strong currency as they make large chunks of their sales and revenues in foreign currencies, which are then worth less when translated back into euros.The rising euro also results in higher costs and a pressure to raise prices, potentially making exporters less competitive.Daimler (DE:DAIGn) said the strong euro would dampen revenue growth this year, while Sanofi said a stronger euro had a negative effect of 8.3 percent on sales in the first quarter. [nL8N1S40Z4]Euro zone industrials, and consumer cyclicals, sectors dominated by exporters, have been delivering weaker than expected first-quarter revenues, Reuters data shows, with some of the biggest negative earnings surprises.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said currency effects were to blame for a disconnect between earnings growth beats and stocks' performance. ""We believe this has been a direct consequence of investors' concerns about FX downgrades causing further downside risks to earnings,"" they said. Some of the region's biggest drinks makers all said the strong euro would crimp profits. Heineken  (AS:HEIN) said the strong euro would wipe 200 million euros ($247 million) off operating profit this year based on current exchange rates. In mid-February, it had put the figure at 190 million euros. [nL8N1RV1JR] Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) also increased its estimate of the euro's negative impact, to 200 million from its previous estimate of 180 million, and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) said foreign exchange movements would knock 17 to 18 million euros off full-year operating profit. [nL8N1RV1PM] [nL8N1RW0TB]Overall each 10 percent move higher in the euro takes around 6 percent off earnings per share (EPS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said, and 70 percent of the time the euro has strengthened, euro area equities have underperformed in local terms. The strong euro is also part of the rationale for some brokers recommending investors shift from the more cyclical parts of the market to defensives, as cyclical sectors are both more exposed to global growth and to the negative currency effect.The worst could be over for Euro zone exporters, however.The biggest upward surge in the euro was in the second quarter last year when French President Emmanuel Macron was elected, and Q2 earnings will thus be compared with a higher euro base a year ago.In addition, the euro has fallen from its mid-February peak, suggesting the pressure could ease.Analysts at JP Morgan said while the U.S. is strongly outperforming Europe in terms of sales delivery in the first quarter, ""the worst of the Euro headwind happened in Q1, and in the second half positive sales surprises should shift from the U.S. to (the) Euro area."" Some investors were reluctant to make any bets on a reversal of the currency effect, however, arguing the euro alone could not be responsible for the extent of Europe's underperformance of the United States.""For us it's neither here nor there. Even net of any currency effects European markets have been a bit disappointing in the last year or so,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

77,"Apr 05, 2018 02:24PM ET",Investors scope out potential European wins from U.S.-China frictions,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - Nobody wins a trade war, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said in March. But for some European companies, a bit of friction couldn't hurt.European producers of aircraft, telecoms equipment and whisky could stand to benefit if U.S.-China trade tensions allow them to chip away at their American rivals' share of the massive Chinese market. Traders and investors have begun looking at which European stocks could reap rewards if the two countries impose tariffs on a long list of each other's goods.""A trade war is a battle that could create opportunities,"" said Hans Ulrich Jost, European value equities portfolio manager at GAM.China's tariff list targets U.S. aircraft imports, hurting Boeing (N:BA) and potentially opening the way for European arch-rival Airbus (PA:AIR) to fill the gap. Boeing is the main proxy in any trade war plays, according to a trader at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets, who said he had seen some investors short the stock in the past weeks. China accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. aircraft exports and all U.S. auto exports, according to UBS.Boeing's shares were punished on Wednesday but recovered at the close, while Airbus was among the best performers. UBS analysts said in a note ""the impact should be marginal for Boeing, with limited upside for Airbus."" Several traders who spoke to Reuters were pushing the ""Buy Airbus vs Boeing"" play. (GRAPHIC: April 5 Airbus Boeing - https://reut.rs/2GAsCOv)SPORTSWEAR AND WHISKYThe consumer sector could also see some rotation of Chinese demand away from big U.S. names and into European brands. German sportswear brand Adidas (DE:ADSGn), for example, could make inroads to the detriment of U.S. rival  Nike  (N:NKE).Investors emphasized that Nike, which makes most of its products in China, would likely see little price change from the tariffs, however. Any impact would likely come from Chinese consumers actively turning away from U.S. brands.One portfolio manager said he was short Nike shares as he expected Chinese consumers to shun the brand in favor of European names. U.S. companies producing to export to China, like the maker of Jack Daniels whisky in Kentucky (N:BFb), could be more directly impacted.European drinks makers' shares rose on Wednesday on speculation Chinese demand may switch to European equivalents such as Martell cognac and Chivas Regal whisky, produced by  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), or Remy Martin cognac (PA:RCOP).(GRAPHIC: Adidas overtakes Nike year to date 2018 - https://reut.rs/2q7pVtF)Nokia (HE:NOKIA) was singled out by traders and analysts as a likely beneficiary of tariffs drawing more Chinese demand to European mobile equipment makers. Its shares were steady during Wednesday's sell-off and were up 1.9 percent on Thursday.Europe's biggest export to China is telecommunications equipment, according European statistics office Eurostat. Big exporters of industrial machinery, such as ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), could also be relatively favored by higher U.S.-China trade costs because they compete directly with U.S. firms such as Honeywell (N:HON), said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). ABB and Siemens enjoyed strong price gains on Thursday. Investors also pointed to European chipmakers such as ASML (AS:ASML) and Infineon  as likely to benefit from China switching away from U.S. semiconductor suppliers. Semiconductor stocks, which have led the rally in tech over the past year, are highly liquid and therefore easy for investors to short as a proxy to the trade war theme, the Northern Trust trader said.""A TAX ON SOUTHERN GERMAN AUTO""The complicated nature of global supply chains means tariffs on U.S. imports could also negatively impact European companies.Chinese tariffs on auto imports from the United States, for example, could disproportionately hurt European carmakers which export their products to China from U.S. plants.""If China passes an incremental 25 percent tax on U.S.-specific auto exports into China (on top of the existing 25 percent tariff for all global auto imports into China), then this is essentially a tax on southern German auto,"" Evercore analysts led by Arndt Ellinghorst said, pointing specifically to BMW and Mercedes SUVs built in America and exported to China.Asked about the Chinese tariffs,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said it would not speculate about ongoing negotiations.Companies with manufacturing sites in China could also get hurt.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts pointed to the healthcare sector, where medical technology companies GN Store (CO:GN), Sonova (S:SOON) and Philips (AS:PHG) have big Chinese manufacturing facilities.They mainly sell their products domestically, elsewhere in Asia and in Europe, however, so the impact would likely be limited, they said in a note.(GRAPHIC: Most traded goods globally - https://tmsnrt.rs/2uMHRhI)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

81,"Mar 12, 2018 05:10PM ET",Europe's drinks sector tells EU it will offer more product info,nan,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's drinks sector announced plans on Monday to inform consumers more about the energy content and ingredients in beer, wine and spirits in a self-policing move, but critics said much of this information would only be available online.Alcoholic beverages have been exempted from EU labeling rules that came into force in December 2014 for all other food and drinks, but the European Commission called on the sector to come up with a proposal this year to regulate itself.Seven trade bodies, covering beer, wine and spirits, gave their voluntary commitment on the issue to EU Health Commissioner Vytenis Andruikaitis, who will be responsible for analyzing the proposal.The European alcoholic beverages sector said it was committing to providing nutrition information and the list of ingredients of their products.This information would be provided to consumers online, possibly with a web-link or QR code on the label itself to allow consumers easier access.The energy values would be provided per 100 millilitres, as for standard drinks, but could also be available per typical serving, something the spirits industry has been keen on because of the smaller measures used for the likes of whisky or gin.""We ask the Commission to consider allowing energy on spirits labels to be given more prominently per serving size than per 100 ml,"" said Ulrich Adam, director general of industry group spiritsEUROPE, which represents national organizations and multinationals such as  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP).The brewing sector said that over 70 percent of beers in the EU already list ingredients on the label. Separately, some countries have already set stricter measures for alcohol labeling, such as Austria, which requires producers of some wines to disclose the amount of sugar per serving. EU consumer organization BEUC said the proposal allowed manufacturers to choose between on-label or online information and that the latter was unsatisfactory as consumers made shopping decisions in seconds.""It is unrealistic to expect they will take a few minutes to check online how calorific wine or vodka is,"" BEUC director general Monique Goyens said in a statement, adding also that about 30 percent of EU consumers did not have a smartphone.A group of public health associations also expressed reservations and urged the Commission to dismiss the proposal.""We do not have to go online to find information for milk or orange juice, why should we for wine?"" said Mariann Skar, secretary general of European Alcohol Policy Alliance.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"Feb 21, 2018 10:45AM ET",Scotch whisky makers see dram half full over Brexit,nan,"By Elisabeth O'Leary and Martinne GellerFALKIRK, Scotland/LONDON (Reuters) - Scotch whisky makers were among the most fervent industry advocates for staying in the European Union, but if Britain has to leave, they prefer a clean break.The industry, already busy preparing for transport and logistical challenges, says it would be happy to stay in the EU single market and the customs union after Britain leaves the world's largest trading bloc if it had a say in regulations and a right to make bilateral trade deals. If that's not possible, then it would be better to have no deal and default to World Trade Organisation rules, which mandate a zero percent tariff on Scotch imports into the EU, said Karen Betts, chief executive officer of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA).""When we think it through, there are real risks, if you stay in the single market, of continuing to be bound by the EU's rules but not being able to influence them,"" she said. The industry would keep an open mind as long as negotiations with Brussels are going on, however, she said. The industry position matters: Scotch exports were worth 4.36 billion pounds ($6.10 billion) in 2017, more than one fifth of all of Britain's food and drink exports and 40,000 jobs.To some extent, its position is unique.For one thing, there's the advantageous tariffs under the WTO, which apply to almost all spirits.For another, while its supply chain is almost all UK-based, exports account for 90 percent of output, meaning it has seen big benefits from the post-Brexit weakness in the pound.Protected by a UK law which means it can only be made in Scotland, Scotch is dominated by multinationals like  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and has been an export sector for centuries. Distillers are skilled in cross-border trade and able to absorb logistical challenges and extra costs. What the industry wants now is clarity about the terms under which Britain will leave the EU and how much time it has to get ready for it. ""We play the cards that we are dealt. We kind of just want to know what the cards are,"" Betts said.RISKS ...A big concern, shared by other goods exporters, is how transport to the EU will be affected by a change in IT systems for trade with non-EU countries agreed before the Brexit vote.If the agreed transition is not long enough following Brexit Day on March 29, 2019, the system may have to be used for all exports, including to the EU, just months after it has been introduced. The volume of declarations processed annually in that case will rise to 255 million from 55 million now, the government says, so it needs to be running glitch-free by then. Whisky makers are making contingency plans for alternative routes and storage in case border delays affect sales or costs.France, Spain and Poland are among the top ten global destinations for Scotch, together accounting for 19.3 million 9-litre cases in 2016, or 21 percent of the total, according to drink industry researchers IWSR. By far the world leader with 13.6 million cases, France is led by Marie Brizard (PA:MBWS), which ships William Peel Scotch from Scotland but also French spirits and cognac into Britain. The company's Scotch travels to France via Belgium, using ships and trains instead of trucks. Chief Executive Jean-Noel Reynaud believes logistical disruptions will be manageable. ""We will just have to adapt to the new supply chain rules,"" he said. ""If we have to account for another one or two weeks in the supply, we'll do so. When we export to China it takes much more time than just importing from the UK.""If there are bottlenecks, producers can build regional stocks, taking advantage of the fact that Scotch is not perishable, said Duncan Swift, who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens.Pernod Ricard, which has 20 percent of the French market with its Clan Campbell and Ballantine's brands, already operates via 85 distribution centers around the world and could easily use one in Europe or rent more space, chief executive Alexandre Ricard told Reuters this month. The next few months will be key. ""What is absolutely critical for our business is to be ready to adapt swiftly,"" Ricard said.... AND OPPORTUNITIES Most of the growth opportunities for Scotch whisky comes from outside the EU, in places like Latin America, Asia and the United States, which means the bilateral trade deals that Britain negotiates will be important. Among the fastest-growing markets for single malt Scotch in 2016 was the United States - also the world's most valuable market - but also China and India, from a much lower base. Overall Scotch sales in India grew 14 percent in 2016 and single malt sales grew 31 percent, despite a 150 percent tariff. ""It's the biggest whisky market in the world but only 1 percent of what is consumed there is Scotch,"" said Dan Mobley, corporate relations director at Diageo. Trade deals come down to economic muscle, however, and Britain's economy is roughly 15 percent of the EU's. Such deals are also notoriously slow to cement; talks between India and the EU are stalled after a decade so far.""I don't think there are any reasons to believe that a UK-India free trade agreement could be pulled off quickly,"" said Ingo Borchert, senior lecturer in economics at the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.Diageo, which makes 37 percent of the world's Scotch, is keen that Britain copy-and-paste advantageous EU trade arrangements with countries like South Korea and South Africa.Chief Executive Ivan Menezes believes Brexit disruptions and costs are ""not material"" for a global company with 12 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) in annual sales. He said the company and industry were working ""very forcefully"" with government to make their concerns clear.""We don't want things that would make moving a case of Johnnie Walker into Europe or a truck crossing the Irish border slow down. It makes no sense,"" he said at a news conference in London in January.SPIRIT OF ADVENTUREBrexit comes at a time when the market for all kinds of spirits is expanding and consumer tastes are becoming more adventurous, with upsides and downsides for Scotch. ""When I started in the business (in the 1990s) people were loyal to a drink. They'd be a whisky or a gin drinker,"" said Ewen Mackintosh, managing director at independent whisky maker Gordon & MacPhail.""People aren't category-loyal any more, they want to try new things,"" he said at the firm's Speyside distillery, which dates back to 1898.Exports of single malt whisky rose 14.2 percent in 2017, making up a quarter of total exports and driven by demand for unique tipples. Investment has poured into distilleries over the past five years, unabated by Brexit.Diageo, which has spent about 1 billion pounds on facilities in Scotland since 2012, is due to reopen two rural distilleries that enjoy cult status among enthusiasts, in Port Ellen and Brora. Pernod will spend 40 million pounds to expand its Scotch bottling facility in Dumbarton this year. More than a dozen smaller whisky distilleries have opened in Scotland since 2013.Ian Macleod Distillers bought Rosebank, a collector's favorite whose spirit goes for up to 2,500 pounds a bottle, in October 2017. With turnover of 65 million pounds, Macleod's has an 80-million-pound loan facility, backed by whisky stocks, to expand further. ""Brexit did not come into our decision (to buy Rosebank). We discussed it and dismissed it,"" said Neil Boyd, UK director.Idled since 1993, the distillery is due to reopen in 2019, along with a visitor's center in Falkirk, a growing visitor destination between Edinburgh and Glasgow.Tourism is also helping bigger players. Over the past year, the number of tourists visiting Diageo's 12 visitor centers across Scotland rose 15.2 pct. Spending per visitor is up 13 percent in 2016. Whisky makers' general confidence may come from decades of working with a product that only gets better with age. ""If I don't need (the Scotch) as a 5-year-old, you keep it and it becomes a 10-year-old, and then again later it will become a 15-year-old,"" said Gordon & MacPhail's Mackintosh. ""So if you have the confidence to ride out the hard times, well, actually you can end up in a better place.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

84,"Feb 13, 2018 02:11PM ET",Pernod sees no impact yet from legal cannabis but watching closely,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the world's second-largest spirits maker, has not yet seen any impact from the legalization of cannabis in some parts of North America but is monitoring the situation closely, its chief executive said.Alexandre Ricard told reporters the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell cognac was looking for any impact the legalization of cannabis has on its brands but had seen none so far.""What are we going to do about it? It's a little bit early right now to have a clear view as to the real impact cannabis may or may not have,"" Ricard told a news conference on Tuesday held to discuss last week's first-half results.Eight U.S. states, including California and Nevada, have legalized marijuana, already widely approved for medicinal use, for recreational use and some studies show consumers would buy the drug instead of alcohol if it was freely available. Rival Constellation Brands (N:STZ) in October bought a near 10 percent stake in Canadian cannabis maker Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED) to take advantage of any boom as legalization proliferates.Analysts at Bryan, Garnier & Co say the global legal cannabis market is set to grow more than 1,000 percent to reach $140 billion by 2027. Ricard referred to reports that suggested low-end beer sales may be impacted, but added: ""Have we noticed so far, at our level, on our brands, a clear impact? No. But we're monitoring. It's still very early.""Regarding Pernod's stance on mergers and acquisitions, Ricard said the company will carry on doing bolt-on deals, like its recent purchase of a stake in mezcal brand Del Maguey, and divesting non-core assets, like its Mexican brandy business.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) accelerated losses to 0.6 percent after Catalonia failed to meet a deadline set by Madrid to renounce its independence bid, setting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on course to impose direct rule on the region.Madrid's IBEX (IBEX) was down 1 percent, lagging other markets.London's FTSE (FTSE), Paris's CAC 40 (FCHI), Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) and Milan's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) were down 0.6 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.Bank stocks (SX7P) fell back 0.7 percent as Spanish lenders came under pressure, while Spanish government bond yields rose. ""The market is going in risk-off mode"", said Pierre Martin, a senior sales trader at Saxo Bank a few minutes after the latest developments in the Spanish crisis hit the headlines. Earlier, markets had retreated only slightly, after underwhelming third quarter trading updates. Shares in advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) fell more than 6 percent after third-quarter sales were below market forecasts, while German forklift truck and robotics maker Kion (DE:KGX) was down 9.2 percent after it cut its 2017 guidance.  Unilever  (L:ULVR) fell 4.5 percent as its underlying sales growth missed analysts' consensus.Martin argued that while the initial reaction from investors seemed to be negative, it was still too early to get a clear picture of Europe's third quarter earnings season. French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) were up 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent respectively after their results.But Martin said the situation in Catalonia was likely to set the tone for the day.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

95,"Oct 18, 2017 07:51PM ET",Exclusive: Trump selects Washington lawyer Joe Simons to head FTC - official,nan,"By Diane BartzWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has selected Joseph Simons, an antitrust attorney from a Washington law firm, to head the Federal Trade Commission, a White House official said on Wednesday.Trump is expected to nominate Simons to the agency, along with Noah Phillips and Rohit Chopra to be FTC commissioners, the White House official said. Upon confirmation, Simons will be designated chairman, the official said.The agency is currently headed by Acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, with Democrat Terrell McSweeny the only other commissioner. The president has long been expected to name a permanent chair and fill the three empty commission seats, two Republican and one Democrat or independent.Simons, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, was a director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003.During Simons' tenure at the FTC, the agency sued to stop  Diageo  (LON:DGE) PLC and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) from buying Seagram Spirits and Wine in 2001 to prevent a duopoly in rum. The FTC also filed a lawsuit in 2003 to stop Haagen-Dazs owner Nestle Holdings Inc from buying Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc, which makes also superpremium ice cream. The FTC later settled both cases.Noah Phillips, who graduated from Stanford Law School in 2005, is chief counsel for U.S. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. He is also a veteran of the law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Cravath, Swaine & Moore. To fill the empty Democratic seat on the commission, the president tapped Rohit Chopra, a financial services expert. Chopra, an ally of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, is currently at the Consumer Federation of America.The FTC works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising. It is an independent agency that is headed by a chairman and four commissioners. No more than three commissioners can come from any one party.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

96,"Oct 13, 2017 03:01AM ET",Brandy chases whisky in South African spirit wars,nan,"By TJ StrydomJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Klippies and coke. Ricky Louw. Karate Water. These are the orders ringing out in bars across South Africa as thrifty consumers switch from imported, big-brand whisky to various types of locally produced brandy to quench their thirst. The trend, fueled by a stagnant economy that is strangling spending, has led to the first increase in brandy sales for more than a decade, and falling sales of pricier whisky.This is an unexpected reversal in a country that multinationals Pernod Ricard (PA:PERP) and Diageo (LON:DGE) targeted as a lucrative growth market for their whisky brands, and where they had enjoyed years of surging sales among an emerging middle class. Pernod Ricard sells more Jameson in South Africa than anywhere else apart from the United States.Brandy still lags its rival in the contest to be the number one spirit by some distance - about 32 million liters is sunk a year versus nearly 39 million of whisky - but the gap has almost halved since 2014, when the economic slump set in.Most brandies retail for around $8 (110 rand) for a 750 ml bottle, compared with around $13 for Diageo's Johnnie Walker Red Label and $20 for Pernod Ricard's Jameson, the two most popular whiskies. A significant price difference in a country where the minimum wage is less than $2 an hour.""At my local a double brandy is the same price as a single Jameson,"" says Fred Bester, 36, a sales consultant for technology startups in Johannesburg. ""That's why I now drink brandy.""The international companies, however, are fighting back. They are shifting focus to more affordable whisky brands and dipping into their war chests to step up marketing drives. Pernod Ricard does not break down results by country, but acknowledged brandy was taking market share in South Africa because of lower pricing.The company's national sales director Werner Vosloo told Reuters it was trying to avoid a ""knee-jerk"" reaction that could damage the long-term potential and image of its brands and so was steering clear of price cuts.He said it was also increasing advertising and promotional spending. He declined to provide figures, but the drive is evident on billboards, TVs and social media across the country. Hollywood actor Don Cheadle can be seen sipping Chivas Regal on a huge billboard overlooking one of the country's busiest routes, on the way to the Johannesburg business hub of Sandton - known as the richest square mile in Africa. Pernod Ricard has also had a marketing push for its more affordable premium brand, Ballantine's, which costs about $15. It is trying to woo customers with ""gift packs"", said Vosloo, typically a free whisky glass or two when you buy a bottle. Britain's Diageo, the number one player, has seen a 6 percent drop in whisky sales volumes over the past year. But it said this year that it was benefiting from the launch in the country of Johnnie Walker Green Label - a more affordable gift option to its high-end Blue Label. A bottle costs $47 versus $160. The two companies dominate the market for whisky, which accounts for a third of the South African spirits market. They are, however, somewhat insulated from falling sales by solid demand for vodka, which they also sell. It is the nation's No.3 spirit, with about 27 million liters consumed last year. WINE THAT BURNSAt the turn of the century, brandy - first distilled in South Africa on a Dutch ship in Cape Town harbor in 1672 - was the number one spirit by a stretch, with around 40 million liters consumed a year, almost twice the amount of whisky.Over the following years, however, robust economic growth averaging nearly 5 percent gave rise to a burgeoning middle class with more disposable income. Sales of more imported whisky rocketed while brandy demand shrunk.Slowing economic growth over the past three years has hammered household incomes. After a recession in the first two quarters of 2017, growth is forecast by the central bank to reach 0.6 percent this year, not nearly enough to make a dent in the unemployment rate of 27.7 percent.Whisky consumption has dropped, falling from a high of 43.2 million liters in 2014 to 38.7 million in 2016, data from industry monitor SAWIS shows. The consumption of brandy, or brandewyn - an Afrikaans word that means ""the wine that burns"" - meanwhile increased for the first time since 2005 last year, to 32.1 million liters, from 31.6 million in 2015.The recovery is driven by locally produced products - French Cognac and other imported brandies account for only 1 percent of the market and are aimed at the wealthiest consumers. The surge in local brandy sales is also supporting the local wine industry because South African regulations require brandy producers to use wine as their base product. With every 1 percent rise in brandy sales volumes, the price of distilling wine is lifted by 0.9 percent, according to industry players. ""Wine producers earmark grapes specifically for wine that goes to brandy producers and they usually get paid quite quickly, which is good for cashflow and supports thousands of jobs,"" said Christo Conradie of industry group Vinpro which represents 3,500 wine producers. 'RENAISSANCE'The chief executives of two of the largest three brandy producers - Distell and KWV - told Reuters that the rising sales trend had continued since the latest SAWIS figures were released, and that they had both seen a 5 percent increase in volumes in the past year. ""Brandy sales have recovered and it has definitely been the weaker economy playing a role,"" Distell's CEO Richard Rushton told Reuters. ""Consumers are cutting back and have been choosing brandy as good value for money.""Distell makes Klipdrift and Richelieu, nicknamed klippies and Ricky Louw (a common name) by drinkers. But it's the cheaper Viceroy label - about $7 a bottle - that has shown the strongest sales growth, Rushton said.Boyce Lloyd, CEO of KWV, which makes brandy of various cask ages under the KWV label, said the economic slump had fueled a ""renaissance"" for the spirit - widely dubbed karate water because of its alcoholic kick.""With brandy you can get a quality product for 50 percent cheaper than a whisky or a vodka.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Analysts at Jefferies said Carrefour's results forced a re-evaluation of their investment thesis.The retail index has been one of the worst-performing in Europe this year as competition and structural pressures mount.""It's been a tough time for the sector, with the more macro theme that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is slowly eating everyone's lunch, though that's not the case in Europe to the same extent as the U.S.,"" said Paul Harper, equity strategist at DNB Bank.""Another problem is that the retail sector is relatively highly priced, so there's not really much room for disappointment,"" he added. Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) shares slipped 4.1 percent after the world's second biggest spirits group said currency exchange would be a bigger weight on earnings than previously expected.Meanwhile,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO),  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), up 2.4 to 4.2 percent, helped lift the index as copper prices rose on stronger Chinese demand.Chipmakers AMS and Dialog Semiconductor rose 3.2 to 3.7 percent as the suppliers to smartphone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) benefited from increased investor enthusiasm ahead of Apple's next iPhone release, a trader said.Though banking stocks helped stoke gains on Thursday, they were headed for their worst monthly losses since June last year when Britain's vote to exit the EU roiled markets.The STOXX 600 was set to close in the red for a third month.While a global consensus has formed this year around stronger prospects for European equities, the region’s main benchmarks have slipped in the summer as company earnings were measured up against lofty expectations and a surging euro reined stocks back.""You can explain a significant chunk of the dip by the currency,"" said Paul Harper. ""Consensus earnings for the MSCI Europe peaked in mid-May and estimates started lowering in the second quarter as analysts had to mark to market their currency assumptions.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

107,"Jun 21, 2017 07:50PM ET",Diageo to buy George Clooney's tequila brand Casamigos for up to $1 billion,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) -  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE) has agreed to buy George Clooney's high-end tequila brand Casamigos in a deal valuing it at up to $1 billion, as the world's largest spirits maker seeks to boost its presence in a high-growth market.Diageo said on Wednesday it would pay $700 million initially for the company, co-founded by the American actor, with potential payment of a further $300 million linked to performance over 10 years.The deal comes two weeks after  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) took a stake in mezcal maker Del Maguey, and highlights the opportunity companies see in Mexico's native spirits. A new spate of high-end tequilas has helped the drink transcend its traditional image as a party beverage for young drinkers. Its sales rose 5.2 percent globally last year, according to data tracker IWSR, outperforming a spirits industry that edged up only 0.3 percent. Casamigos, which means ""house of friends,"" was founded in 2013 by Clooney and his friends - nightlife entrepreneur Rande Gerber, who is married to model Cindy Crawford, and real estate developer Mike Meldman. They will continue to promote the brand. Diageo, which has arrangements with other celebrities including David Beckham and Sean Combs, said Casamigos will be neutral to earnings for the first three years and add to earnings thereafter.The brand sold 120,000 9-litre cases in 2016, primarily in the United States, and is on track to reach over 170,000 by the end of the year. Diageo said expanding the brand to Europe would be a source of future growth. The company did not provide revenue or earnings figures for the business. Its North American president, Deirdre Mahlan, told reporters that companies like Casamigos, which are growing fast with lots of room ahead, were ""notoriously challenging to value under traditional methods"". When asked about rising tensions between Mexico and the United States, Mahlan said she did not anticipate any barriers that would stop Diageo from continuing to grow its business. Diageo's other tequila brands include Don Julio, DeLeon and Peligroso. It distributed Jose Cuervo outside of Mexico until 2012, following its failure to strike a deal to buy it outright from the brand's founding family. The Casamigos deal is expected to close in second half of the year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

109,"May 24, 2017 06:40AM ET",'Food revolution': megabrands turn to small start-ups for big ideas,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Food and drink megabrands are seeing their sales chewed away by smaller, nimbler, cooler rivals. They can't beat them - so now they're joining them. Nine of the world's biggest industry players, including  Danone  (PA:DANO),  General Mills  (N:GIS),  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) and Kellogg (N:K), have launched venture capital units over the past 18 months, a Reuters analysis of the sector shows. The aim of the strategy, according to interviews with executives, is to buy into - and learn from - the kind of start-up innovation that has become their nemesis, from micro-distilled spirits and cold-pressed juices to kale chips and vegan burgers.Food and drink multinationals spend far less on R&D than their counterparts in many sectors like tech and healthcare. They have been wrongfooted over the past five years by the shifting habits of consumers who are increasingly shunning established brands in favor of small, independent names they regard as healthier, more authentic and original. This is forcing the companies to take a leaf out of Silicon Valley's venture capital playbook - and their success or failure in harnessing promising new trends at a very early stage could help determine how well they adjust to the changing landscape, and whether they ultimately emerge as winners or losers. ""It's difficult for companies to have the persistence and to replicate the energy and the passion that these early-stage entrepreneurs have,"" said John Haugen, head of General Mills' venture capital arm 301 Inc, adding innovation was extremely tough because of how quickly market trends were changing.""We're just a year or a little more than that into these investments,"" he said of 301, where his team of about 15 sits down twice a month to pass around dozens of samples from start-ups. ""For me it's part of a total long-term growth strategy for our company."" In the United States - the world's biggest packaged food market - small ""challenger"" brands could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time compared with 5 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. The researchers point to successful upstart brands like Chobani Greek Yogurt, which they say has stolen more than half of General Mills' market share in yogurt, and Kind Snack Bars which have taken a big bite out of Kellogg's snack bars. 'IT'S AMAZING, THIS SWITCH'The nine companies to recently launch venture capital arms also include Hain Celestial (O:HAIN),  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP). Typically, their funds range in size from about $100 million to $150 million. While it is still early days for them, the experiences of the handful of food and drink firms that have had funds for several years - Nestle (S:NESN),  Unilever  (L:ULVR), Coca-Cola (N:KO), PepsiCo (N:PEP) and  Diageo  (L:DGE) - could offer some guide to the future.Coca-Cola, for example, has had a mixed record; its investment in Honest Tea was a success, but a fermented soda and a Japanese tea failed to take off in the United States. So far none of the companies' venture units has delivered a blockbuster brand, but they say a link to the cutting edge is worth the effort.Diageo, the world's biggest liquor maker, has invested in 14 start-ups through its venture capital arm Distill Ventures, spending about 30 million pounds over the last four years on minority stakes.It points to last year's purchase of a 20 percent stake in Seedlip - a British start-up that says it produces the world's first non-alcoholic distilled spirit - as a prime example of how the strategy is making it more adventurous. ""If we'd had our strategic areas written down four years ago - what does Diageo want to go after - nowhere would we have written down, 'We think there's a big opportunity for a non-alcoholic spirit',"" said James Ashall, who heads its innovation unit Diageo Futures.""By Distill Ventures provoking our thinking about the space it allows us to stretch into an area that wouldn't have been naturally in our gift."" The company also cites learning gained from investments in craft whiskies, as it develops its own brands in that area, which include Roe & Co and Hilhaven Lodge. More broadly, Diageo says the venture arm is changing its culture. The global corporation now makes its marketing managers pitch for their ad budgets, like the entrepreneurs who present at Distill Ventures' laid-back office for 20-30 minutes and get an answer on the spot.""It makes our decision-making faster and more exciting,"" said Diageo's chief marketing officer, Syl Saller.Seedlip founder Ben Branson and other food and drink start-ups are reveling in this surge of investment interest.  ""Big companies are saying, wait a minute, we used to beat these guys down,"" said Branson, a bearded and tattooed ex-marketing executive who grows some Seedlip ingredients - peas and hay - on his farm in eastern England, where he also dabbles in taxidermy and painting. ""Now I think it's amazing that there is this switch to let's not beat them, let's join them."" R&D EXTENSIONThe venture capital divisions are not only for delivering returns or swallowing start-ups, executives say, but also to act as an extension of the companies' research departments. This is of particular importance in an industry that PwC says accounted for just 3 percent of the $680 billion spent globally on R&D last year, well behind the computing and electronics, healthcare and autos sectors, which together spent 62 percent.""This is a form of R&D for us, or access to places where the company isn't currently participating,"" said Simon Burton, who heads Kellogg's new venture capital arm, Eighteen94 Capital.Its first investment, announced in January, was in California-based Kuli Kuli, which makes snack bars from the moringa plant. There are more in the pipeline, he said. As the need for innovation has intensified, the strings that were typically attached to venture capital investments across all sectors - notably the right to buy out the business when it gains scale - have started to disappear in food. Campbell Soup, Kellogg, Unilever and General Mills have largely scrapped such provisions when investing in early-stage brands because they are often a deterrent for start-up entrepreneurs who fear it will cap their fortunes by keeping other bidders away.Campbell's general counsel, Adam Ciongoli, said flexibility was needed to attract the best and brightest. ""Why would they want to sign up from the get-go with the idea that they're not going to be able to maximize their economic leverage and their exit?"" said Ciongoli, who sits on the investment committee of Acre Venture Partners, which Campbell set up last year to contend with the ""revolution going on in food"". 'NEW ROCK STARS'For investors, experimenting with venture capital is worth the relatively small spend, compared with the risk associated with larger M&A deals, which the companies are also pursuing. ""Something really good might come out of it, so I don't have a problem with that,"" said Alan Custis, head of UK equities at Lazard Asset Management, an investor in Diageo and Unilever.The risk of buying a successful small brand at substantial cost, rather than investing at a very early stage, is that this will rob the target of the very size and independence that made it cool. One oft-cited example is Kashi cereal, an organic food pioneer whose sales tumbled after it was swallowed by Kellogg. Olivier Garel used to run M&A for Unilever and now runs Unilever Ventures. He said the consumer goods sector was relatively late to the venture capital game, but was now being motivated by the need to keep up with new technologies including social media, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer selling models.Unilever Ventures has invested in more than three dozen start-ups and says it is in contact with about 2,500. This month it announced a deal leading a $9.2 million funding round for U.S. organic food delivery service Sun Basket. Augustin Paluel-Marmont, who sold 40 percent of his French cookie company Michel et Augustin to Danone Manifesto Ventures last year, said it was a good time to be a food start-up. ""It is a lot easier today than before to find funds,"" he said. ""Entrepreneurs are the new rock stars.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

114,"Apr 20, 2017 06:20AM ET","Pernod rides U.S and China growth, cautions on India highway ban",nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) third quarter sales beat forecasts on Thursday, lifting its shares, but the French spirits group cautioned that a ban on alcohol sales near Indian highways would slow growth in its second-largest market.Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits group after Britain's  Diageo  (L:DGE), maintained its profit outlook, saying it saw further robust growth in the U.S, its largest market, and in Europe and improving Chinese demand for its Martell cognac.The owner of Mumm champagne and Absolut vodka said it expected underlying operating profit growth of between 2 and 4 percent in the full year to June 30.India, which accounts for about 10 percent of group revenue, has been a key growth area, driven by local whisky brands such as Blender's Pride and Royal Stag.But a government ban on high-value bank notes held back local consumption in the second and third quarter and sales growth in India slowed to 1 percent in the nine months to March 31, from 12 percent in the full year 2015-16, Pernod said.While the ban on alcohol sales near Indian highways will impact sales mainly in the fourth quarter and in the first half of the fiscal year 2017/18, finance chief Gilles Bogaert told Reuters he hoped they should be close to flat in the full year ending June 30 and he was confident about India over the long-term.The company did not specify what proportion of its sales in India would be hit by the highway sales ban. Pernod Ricard  posted sales of 1.987 billion euros ($2.13 billion) in the three months to March 31, up 3 percent on a like-for-like basis, beating expectations for 1 percent growth, helped by double-digit sales growth of its Jameson Irish whiskey in the United States and improving demand in Europe.Pernod shares had gained 1.8 percent to 115.3 euros by 1010 GMT, outperforming the French blue chip CAC-40 index.""The stronger-than-expected (results) ... should provide further comfort that the business continues to improve,"" Jefferies analysts, who have a ""buy"" rating, said in a note.However, the performance marked a slight slowdown from 4 percent growth in the second quarter, reflecting weaker sales in Asia due to regulatory changes in India and the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year, which helped second quarter sales.Like other spirits makers, Pernod Ricard has been hit by a downturn in China sparked by a government clampdown on extravagant spending and its sales fell in the third quarter and were flat over the nine months, after falling 9 percent last year, although Bogaert said the underlying trend was improving.""The expected rebound in China is materializing,"" he said, echoing  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) which made optimistic comments over its prospects in the country.($1 = 0.9327 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

117,"Mar 31, 2017 04:41AM ET",Changes at Diageo put focus back on Scotch,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) -  Diageo  (LON:DGE), the world's largest spirits maker, spotted in 2015 that drinkers in the emerging middle class in Ghana and Cameroon were keen to show off their new status by buying their own bottles of Johnnie Walker rather than shots.The company increased production of smaller bottles, helping to lift Johnnie Walker sales 12 percent in Africa in the first half of its 2017 fiscal year and contributing to Diageo's first sales growth in Scotch in over three years.Diageo and spirits peers including  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and Brown-Forman were hurt by a slowdown starting in 2013 in emerging markets where they had found much of their growth. The world leader particularly suffered, as its wholesalers had large stocks to run down. Chief Executive Ivan Menezes called 2016 a ""transition year"" to get back on track following changes to make Diageo more responsive, including removing management layers and giving more power to local managers, such as the ones in Africa who noticed the demand for smaller bottles. ""What's happened is that global and local got a lot closer,"" said Stephen White, Diageo's general manager for African innovation.""It's definitely sped things up and it's a better set-up certainly for a market like Africa where you need a more entrepreneurial space to be able to operate.""Diageo's half-year results in January were the strongest of Menezes' three-year tenure, and signaled to investors that his turnaround plan was working. He has put a much keener focus in the business on Scotch which is made in Scotland and accounts for more than a quarter of Diageo's sales, a third of its profits and derives the majority of its sales in emerging markets.Aside from expanding the reach and improving the marketing of premium, global brands like Johnnie Walker, the strategy for emerging markets includes offering more lower-priced whisky brands, including VAT 69, White Horse and Black & White.Black & White recently became the top-selling Scotch in recession-hit Brazil, Diageo said, following sales growth of 58 percent there in the most recent period.WEAK SPOTSStill, Liberum analyst Alicia Forry downgraded the shares to ""sell"" in January, noting that the improvement was already priced in. While she acknowledged the better performance, particularly in Johnnie Walker, she said people ""should not get carried away"" since other Diageo brands were struggling.The vodka brand Smirnoff fell 2 percent, hurt by ongoing discounting. A spokeswoman for Diageo acknowledged that it was a tough category and said: ""There is more work to do in recruiting and re-recruiting multi-cultural consumers as well as Gen X and baby boomers"".   Beer, which represents 16 percent of Diageo's sales, was also lackluster with flat sales. Guinness, its main beer brand, has faced increased competition, from craft beers in North America and Europe, and cheaper brews like Anheuser-Busch InBev's Hero and its own local brand Satsenbrau, in the important market of Nigeria.Following the 2015 divestiture of Diageo's wine business, analysts have speculated that Diageo could sell the beer division to focus exclusively on spirits. Diageo has repeatedly said beer is key to its strategy in Africa, as it provides a distribution platform for spirits.Another weak spot for Diageo, analysts say, is its relatively small position in bourbon whiskey, a growing market due to a resurgence of classic cocktails in the United States where bourbon is made.Diageo's Bulleit bourbon grew net sales 29 percent in the first half, but its overall position remains small versus rivals Beam Suntory (BSI.UL) and Brown-Forman. However, its Canadian Crown Royal whiskey brand has gained market share and gives it a large foothold in the wider category of North American whiskey which includes bourbon.SALES CHANGEAs part of its efforts to react more quickly to trends, Diageo said in late 2013 it would change its sales focus, to monitor not only what it sells to wholesalers, but also what they sell to retailers. This is seen as a better measure of what people are drinking and is meant to make sales more consistent.That change hit Diageo's sales in 2014 and 2015 as wholesale customers worked through stocks, but Janus Capital analyst Greg Kuczynski said it should make for a smoother business and a higher stock price.""There's a lot of investment shops that probably turned away from a company like Diageo because they just don't want to have exposure to the stocking and destocking cycles which can be so painful,"" said Kuczynski, whose firm is a top 60 Diageo shareholder, according to Reuters data.The measure also gives real-time data that can speed up forecasting, decision-making and innovation. Johnnie Walker used such sales data from the September launch of its first limited-edition experiment, Red Rye Finish, to better allocate stock for its second one. It has helped cut the time it takes to get new products to market down to an average of 34 weeks. Johnnie Walker Green Label, largely discontinued in 2012, was brought back in 2016 in only 9 weeks, it said.Diageo also says the business has benefited from increased investment made possible by a ""zero-based budgeting"" system to help it save 500 million pounds over three years.The company may also be on the cusp of more changes, given the arrival in January of a new chairman, Javier Ferran, a drinks industry and private equity veteran. ""Companies do not change overnight, however we think Diageo could start to look different,"" said Jefferies analyst Edward Mundy. He mentioned more cost cutting and the possible sale of the beer business if needed to fund a buyout of Moet Hennessy, of which Diageo owns a stake.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

119,"Feb 28, 2017 06:27AM ET",France: Reasons to be bullish despite election stress,nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - If financial markets are a guide, France is facing a perilous period of turbulence and uncertainty as the presidential election nears. But the underlying economy is telling a different story.While France's bond yields have spiked and its stocks have trailed the rest of the euro zone, as investors run scared of political risk, the country's economic prospects are actually looking up.French business confidence, consumer confidence and job creation are surging, while earnings expectations for big French companies are also improving. Whoever wins May's election - whether it be conservative Francois Fillon, far-right leader Marine Le Pen or centrist Emmanuel Macron - will start their five-year term with hiring at a decade high and the sluggish economy finally strengthening.Ironically they may have predecessor Francois Hollande to thank, as his business-friendly reforms could be bearing fruit at last - too late for the man whose failure to turn the economy around helped make him the most unpopular president in modern French history and pushed him towards the political exit.For a factbox on past reforms click For some large international investors, any risk aversion to France offers buying opportunities for stocks underpinned by robust fundamentals.""When markets apply a blanket negative response to an issue like France, we can come in and benefit our shareholders,"" said Steve Caruthers, an investment specialist in Los Angeles with Capital Group Companies Inc, which manages $1.4 trillion.""We have lots of companies within France that we have high conviction in today. They offer attractive valuations, certainly, compared to a lot of their U.S. competitors,"" said Caruthers, whose firm holds stakes in Airbus (PA:AIR), spirits maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH). POLITICAL RISKOther bond and stock market investors fear the global populist revolt that propelled Brexit and Donald Trump could sweep Le Pen to power. A scandal over Fillon's payments of state money to family members has left the election with no clear favorite. Though polls put Le Pen in the lead to win the Apr. 23 first round of the two-round election, either Fillon or Macron are seen easily beating her in a May 7 runoff.She has however narrowed the gap with her rivals in second-round voting intention surveys, a development which last week drove the premium that investors demand to hold French over German debt to highs not seen since late 2012. ""Le Pen's campaign is gaining traction and we can't ignore that, even though her victory is hardly anybody's main scenario,"" said Hideo Shimomura, chief fund manager at Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management. Japanese investors, traditionally big buyers of French debt, have been net sellers in recent months, according to official data.Some funds say this is more about Japanese investors staying home as long-term yields rise there. Shimomura said that many Japanese institutional investors could also not buy ahead of their book-closing at the end of March.Meanwhile, French bond futures (FOATc1) - used to hedge risk and trade market swings - have seen record interest this month, while some equity investors have been looking for hedges against volatility around the election in put and call options.French stocks have also become the least preferred by portfolio managers in Europe, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey. France's CAC-40 blue-chip index is largely flat since the start of this year, while the Stoxx Europe index of euro zone shares has gained 2 percent. http://reut.rs/2kGj1GTThis is despite improving earnings expectations for French companies; the number of analysts upgrading their earnings expectations for the country's firms is now higher than the number downgrading for the first time since mid-2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) put the probability of a Le Pen presidency at no more than 15 percent, in a research note on Thursday, saying markets were overestimating the likelihood. REAL ECONOMYWhile markets stress about the election, business leaders appear largely unfazed, judging by the latest monthly purchasing managers surveys, which came in at a near six-year high. The surveys have exceeded expectations and, at least for the service sector, have surpassed levels seen in the stronger German economy on firming domestic demand. http://tmsnrt.rs/2mhcHWGEven the long-struggling industrial sector is picking up, with morale rising more than expected this month, according to a monthly survey from the INSEE statistics agency.Official data this month also showed the economy created jobs in the fourth quarter at the fastest pace in a decade thanks to the services sector, which is by far the biggest sector in France. http://tmsnrt.rs/2mhrTmJThe trend looks set to continue with the Labor Ministry reporting job vacancies running at a five-year high and employers planning on hiring a record 216,500 managerial level workers this year, according to the APEC association that represents them.The recovering economy could be down to Hollande's reforms over the past five years, which included a payroll tax credit scheme to boost firms profitability and looser labor market rules to encourage hiring, and are likely to benefit his successor.""Whatever party is elected, these measures will keep having a positive impact on (economic) activity,"" said economist Arthur Jurus at Switzerland's Mirabaud Asset Management.

The brands have not yet factored in the effect of foreign exchange rates on their prices,"" said Charles-Armand de Belenet, marketing director for Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) Martell Mumm Perrier-Jouët champagne brand.The June vote for Britain to quit the European Union led sterling to slump to its lowest level since 1985 against the U.S dollar and to fall against the euro, although it has since edged back up from those lows. [GBP/]The weak pound makes euro-priced products more expensive in sterling terms.French champagne industry executives told Reuters that while they had managed to offset the Brexit impact to an extent this year, with some firms delaying price rises, they would have to raise prices in Britain in 2017 to protect their profit margins.Bruno Paillard, who heads the Lanson (PA:LAN) champagne house, said that while Lanson's sales were showing signs of an increase from last year, exchange rates remained a worry. ""The question of exchange rates is a cause for concern, it represents quite a considerable loss of money,"" said Paillard.Jean-Marie Barillere, president of the Union of Champagne Houses, said champagne firms that billed in euros were seeing their costs go up and their orders go down.Taittinger head Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger said his company had had a ""good year, even in England,"" but Bollinger executive Jerome Philipon warned champagne drinkers of higher prices next year.""The major brands will have to hike their prices from January onwards. But one price hike still won't compensate for the hits from the exchange rate,"" he said.France exported 150.7 million bottles of champagne in 2015, worth 2.64 billion euros ($2.76 billion), according to an industry group. Britain accounted for nearly 23 percent of France's champagne exports by volume that year, equivalent to 34.2 million bottles.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

128,"Dec 09, 2016 06:50AM ET",Pernod further expands in craft spirits with Smooth Ambler deal,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the world's second-largest spirits group, has agreed to buy a majority stake in Smooth Ambler Spirits, the U.S. maker of Old Scout bourbon and Greenbrier gin, further strengthening its portfolio of premium craft spirits.The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, follows the acquisition earlier this year of a majority stake in super premium German gin maker Monkey 47, in a bid to tap growing global demand for craft spirits.The investment made by Pernod Ricard's North America subsidiary NBV Investments Inc also marks the return of the French spirits maker to the American whiskey market following its sale of Wild Turkey, the Kentucky bourbon, to Campari in 2009.With small, independent distillers popping up and taking market share worldwide, spirits giants such as Pernod Ricard and  Diageo  (L:DGE) have responded with premium products that tout small batch production and local credentials. ""This investment illustrates perfectly our strategy of partnering with rising entrepreneurs sharing the same passion for authentic, high-quality brands,"" Pernod Ricard CEO Alexandre Ricard said in a statement.""It represents a strong opportunity to enter the fast-growing, high-end bourbon market extending even more our fantastic portfolio of genuine brands in our number 1 market.""The deal will allow Smooth Ambler to boost its spirits production, which currently stands at 10,000 cases of nine-liter bottles per year. It is expected to close in early 2017, pending regulatory approval.Founded in 2009, Smooth Ambler Spirits Co.is located in the Greenbrier Valley of West Virginia. It uses regional natural resources and ingredients to produce gins, vodkas, rums and whiskeys, including the Old Scout Single Barrel Bourbon, which sells for $65 per bottle.Pernod said earlier this week it was confident of hitting its goal for ""mid-single digit"" sales growth this financial year in its top U.S. market, thanks to main growth driver Jameson Irish whiskey but also robust demand for brands such as Malibu rum, Martell cognac and Altos tequila.By 1034 GMT Pernod Ricard shares gained over 2 percent, at 100.40 euros, among the top gainers on the CAC-40 index of French blue chips (FCHI).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

132,"Nov 09, 2016 09:50AM ET",Pernod says Trump election will not change its U.S. investments,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) - French spirits group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) said on Wednesday Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election will not change its investment plans in the United States, its biggest market.Pernod, which makes Havana Club rum though a joint venture with the Cuban government, told Reuters it was waiting for more details on Trump's stance on the communist-ruled island.""We are not really worried and will maintain our investment plans (in the U.S.),"" a group spokesman told Reuters.Pernod Ricard makes 17 percent of its sales in the United States, where it benefits from a growing taste for higher-priced spirits at a time of more sluggish growth in China. The group has been waiting for decades to be allowed to sell its Cuban-made rum in the United States and will be able to do so only when Washington's economic embargo is lifted.In March, Barack Obama made the first visit to Havana by a U.S. president in 88 years. His trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cuba's 1959 revolution.Since that re-opening of ties, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate market-style reforms and boost political and economic freedom.In October, an easing of limits on how much rum Americans can bring back from Cuba for personal use bought Pernod Ricard a step closer to being allowed to export its Cuban-made rum directly to U.S. consumers.Trump's rival, the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, backed the policy of rapprochement with Havana.At a September rally in Miami, which has a large Cuban population, Trump vowed to reverse Obama's moves to open relations with Cuba unless the leaders there allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

133,"Oct 20, 2016 09:41AM ET",Unilever's 'Marmitegate' shows strain on consumer industry,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Unilever's push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company - and wider consumer brands industry - that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth. Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets.The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like  Unilever  (L:ULVR), whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities.Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket,  Tesco  (L:TSCO), which balked at the demand.The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector.An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too.The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs.The day ""Marmitegate"" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices.It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO), which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales.Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's (L:RB), which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle (S:NESN) also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing.Procter & Gamble (N:PG) reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment.WHY UNILEVER?Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. ""We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. ""Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be.""Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales.Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now.""If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried,"" GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. ""If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

But measures announced by the U.S. government on Friday will ease trade, travel and financial restrictions with Cuba that have been in place for decades.Pernod Ricard has been waiting for a long time to be allowed to sell its Cuban-made rum in the United States and will be able to do so only when Washington's economic embargo is lifted.""Pernod Ricard is delighted to learn that the $100 restriction is being lifted and that U.S citizens and travellers to the U.S will be able to bring back ... Havana Club, to the U.S. for personal use from anywhere in the world,"" the group said in an e-mail to Reuters.Pernod Ricard, which has been making Cuban rum in a joint venture with the Cuban government since the 1990s, sells around 50 million bottles, or 4 million cases per year, mostly for exports. It has said the U.S. market could potentially bring its Cuban rum extra sales of 20 million bottles per year.Jefferies investment analysts said in a note: ""The changes do not allow for the commercial importation of Cuban rum or cigars, just yet. However a further lifting of sanctions could open the door for Cuban rum to be imported into the U.S for commercial purposes.""The brokerage, which has a ""buy"" rating on the stock, said: ""For Pernod, we estimate that the Cuban rum opportunity could be worth as much as 8 euros per share,"" referring to the impact of commercial exports if the U.S. were to allow them."

150,"May 12, 2016 09:10AM ET",Adidas investors seek influence on supervisory board,nan,"By Emma ThomassonFUERTH, Germany (Reuters) - Adidas (DE:ADSGn) shareholders elected Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris and a representative of Belgium's richest man Albert Frere to the supervisory board on Thursday after both took significant stakes in the German sportswear group.Frere and Sawiris, along with U.S. investor Mason Hawkins, bought major stakes in Adidas last year after shares in the firm had tumbled following a series of profit warnings as it failed to keep pace with bigger U.S. rival  Nike  (N:NKE).Since then, Adidas has decided to sell its struggling golf business and has appointed former Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) boss Kasper Rorsted to take over as chief executive in October, succeeding Herbert Hainer after his 15 years at the helm.Rather than speaking out in public, the new investors have sought to influence the company behind the scenes.Ian Gallienne, the head of Frere's holding company Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (BR:GBLB) who is also a board member at French drinks firm  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), told the annual general meeting he was engaged in ""constructive dialogue"" with management.Speaking in fluent German, Sawiris told the meeting he hoped his knowledge of emerging markets and financial expertise would help strengthen the board: ""I am looking forward to successful cooperation,"" he said.Some investors have said the Adidas board, dominated by German consultants and union representatives, has lacked the clout of Nike, whose board of directors includes heavyweights such as Apple (O:AAPL) chief executive Tim Cook.Gerhard Jaeger, spokesman for the SdK investor association, told the shareholder meeting that Adidas had made major strides in the last year, but said Rorsted still had a major task ahead of him, particularly to improve profitability.""The weakness is still the margin... the competition shows how it should be done. Adidas is still a world away from Nike,"" Jaeger said.However, he added that he would welcome Hainer joining the supervisory board as possible successor to Chairman Igor Landau after a cooling-off period. Investors have high hopes for Rorsted, hoping he will cut costs and also consider a disposal of long-struggling fitness label Reebok, which Hainer acquired in 2005.Adidas shares were up 1.4 percent at 1243 GMT, bringing their gains this year to almost 28 percent.Hainer admitted that the profitability margin was ""not good enough"" and said the team was working hard to improve it, wishing his successor Rorsted ""lots of luck"" in this regard.Reuters reported in December that Sawiris had formed a partnership with Hawkins to spur boardroom change and influence strategy at companies they invest in, including Adidas.According to Thomson Reuters data, Frere has a 5 percent stake in Adidas, Sawiris' NNS Holding has a 3 percent stake and Hawkins owns 2.9 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The move opened the door to Cubaexport and its French partner,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the world's second-largest spirits group, one day selling Havana Club in the United States in direct competition with Bacardi products. Bacardi, a former Cuban distiller now based in Bermuda, left Cuba after the 1959 revolution and subsequently acquired the rights to the Havana Club trademark from its pre-revolutionary owner whose distillery was nationalized.The United States previously recognized Bacardi's claim to Havana Club under a statute aiming to protect owners of Cuban companies nationalized after Fidel Castro's rebels came to power. Meanwhile, everywhere else in the world, the name belonged to Cuba through the joint venture between Cubaexport and Pernod Ricard.Bacardi's Freedom of Information Act request filed on Monday asks to see all records related to the Havana Club trademark decision held by the executive office of President Barack Obama, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the State Department, the National Security Council, the Treasury Department or any other offices.""The American people have the right to know the truth of how and why this unprecedented, sudden and silent action was taken by the United States government to reverse long-standing U.S. and international public policy and law,"" Eduardo Sanchez, senior vice president and general counsel of Bacardi, said in a statement.The Cuban government has not commented on the case. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not comment on specific cases, a spokesman said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

158,"Dec 31, 2015 08:57AM ET",Champagne sales set for record year ,nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Champagne sales are set for a record year, driven by solid demand from export markets, favorable currencies and stabilizing sales in France, the fizzy drink's home market.Industry estimates gathered by Reuters showed that about 312 million bottles of the prestige sparkling wine will have been dispatched in 2015, a rise of between 2 and 3 percent from 2014.Revenue has risen 4.4 percent to 4.7 billion euros in 2015. In 2007, the record year so far, revenues reached 4.56 billion euros, before the global economic and financial crisis began weighing on the market a year later.The 2015 sales estimates reflected efforts to promote higher-priced products such as special blends and fine vintages, as well as growing demand for Rose Champagnes in Japan and the United States, Champagne's second export market after Britain.In Britain, a solid economy underpinned buoyant demand while austerity-hit Italy and Spain were starting to see signs of an upturn.Economic woes in Champagne's home market of France have taken the fizz out of global sales since 2010, but sales were stabilizing in volume and value this year and could even show a slight rise.""France is on a recovery path. Consumption stabilized,"" said Bruno Paillard, CEO of Lanson BCC (PA:LAN), the number two Champagne house behind luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH).Sales were improving in French hypermarkets as well as in specialized stores.""Consumers need to enjoy life,"" said Paillard, adding lower energy prices and interest rates may have helped improve consumer purchasing power.The Champagne market is dominated by LVMH, which owns the Dom Perignon, Moet & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Ruinart and Krug brands. Specialist makers include Lanson-BCC, Vranken (PA:VRKP) or Laurent Perrier (PA:LPER) as well as drinks group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) with its Mumm and Perrier-Jouet brands.Official figures for 2015 will be published next month.Champagne, which can be produced only in the region of the same name, is facing tougher competition from Spain's cava and Italy's prosecco, sold for as little as a third of the price. Industry professionals say the Champagne sector is fighting back by stepping up efforts to enhance the quality of its own product.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

159,"Nov 25, 2015 01:39PM ET","With U.S.-Cuba detente, a battle over trademarks looms",nan,"By Jaime HamreCAMAGUEY, Cuba (Reuters) - When Julio Manzini decided two years ago to name his small restaurant McDonald's after the famous fast-food chain (N:MCD), he had no idea it could cause any trouble. He has since been frightened into removing the name. ""I don't even know what McDonald's tastes like, I just thought the name was striking, like Shakira or something,"" he said at the lunch counter of what used to be ""Cafeteria La McDonald's Camagueyana"" in the Cuban city of Camaguey, about 300 miles (500 km) east of Havana.This month, Manzini stripped ""McDonald's"" and the famous golden arches from his handcrafted sign as a precaution after he claimed his establishment was visited by a lawyer sent by the company. The place is now simply called ""Cafeteria La Camagueyana."" His counterfeit McDonald's illustrates a potential battlefront between Cuba and the United States over trademark and intellectual property rights as Cuba's economy opens up to more private enterprise and closer ties with the United States.The two countries restored diplomatic relations this year after half a century of Cold War hostility and are now working to improve ties. Trademark and intellectual property issues will be on the negotiating table, both sides have said.Both have grievances. The United States has denied Cuban companies the same trademark protection enjoyed by brands from everywhere else, forcing marquee names such as Havana Club rum and Cohiba cigars into long, expensive court battles. And while Cuba protects trademarks registered with the government, it also tolerates or officially sanctions the resale of unlicensed music, software and entertainment. State television routinely pirates American movies and shows for broadcast. In a socialist economy that only in recent years has allowed small-scale private businesses, knowledge of trademark law is poor. Manzini said he never thought to check with the Cuban Office of Industrial Property (OCPI) to see if the McDonald's name was available. It is not: McDonald's has registered trademarks in Cuba since at least 1985. Despite the United States' 53-year-old trade embargo against Cuba, companies from both countries have continued registering trademarks and patents in the other. Since 1966 about 1,500 U.S. businesses have filed nearly 6,000 trademarks in Cuba, including renewals, according to data from Saegis, the online trademark database from Thomson Reuters.Among them are Coca-Cola (O:COKE), Pepsi (N:PEP), Levi's [LEVST.UL],  Nike  (N:NKE), Starbucks Coffee (O:SBUX),  Pfizer  (N:PFE), Intel (O:INTC), Burger King, KFC and Goodyear (O:GT).Another 1,355 trademarks of U.S. origin, including Walmart (N:WMT) and Google (O:GOOGL), are protected under an international treaty known as the Madrid Protocol, according to World Intellectual Property Organization data.Aside from the ""special hamburgers"" and ""American coffee"" on offer, there is little that separates Manzini's hole-in-the-wall operation from hundreds of other snack bars tucked in doorways across the island. But he was likely violating trademark protections by using the McDonald's name and the golden arches on his sign. He said he only fully understood he could be in trouble after the lawyer visited the restaurant recently while he was away.""I'm really afraid. I don't even pull in 1,000 pesos ($40) a day,"" Manzini said. McDonald's would have to complain to the OCPI to legally stop Manzini and others, such as the ""McDunald"" cafe in the city of Santa Clara, which also uses the golden arches on its sign.A spokeswoman for McDonald's declined to comment except to say that ""we are committed to vigorously protecting our intellectual property.""EXPLOSION OF INTERESTMore companies have registered their brands in Cuba since U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente last December, among them Twitter (N:TWTR), Uber [UBER.UL] and Segway.""There has been an explosion of interest from U.S. companies,"" said Jaime Angeles, an intellectual property lawyer and partner at Dominican law firm Angeles & Lugo Lovaton who represents firms fighting for their trademark rights in Cuba. Some 192 U.S. trademarks were filed in Cuba in the first four months of 2015, compared to 78 in all of 2014, according to Saegis data. A few U.S. companies have seen their brand names pursued by others in Cuba. Gustavo Fuentes, a Cuban lawyer residing in the United States, has applied for 65 trademarks, including famous brands such as John Deere (N:DE), Chase (N:JPM), the NFL and Pixar.Some companies are contesting those rights, including JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), which announced plans for a New York-to-Havana charter five months after Fuentes asked for the name JetBlue. ""We will vigorously protect our brand in Cuba,"" spokesman Doug McGraw said. Fuentes declined to comment. The OCPI has yet to grant him any trademarks, according to its public records. Angeles, who represents eight of the U.S. companies, including restaurant chain IHOP (DIN.UL) and pharmaceutical company  Hospira  (N:HSP), said he was confident they would win the rights to their brands in Cuba. ""The Cuban system has all the legal tools to protect trademarks of any country,"" he said, adding that companies should claim their trademarks before someone else does. ""Filing first is the cheapest protection you can get."" Cuba has long struggled to protect its marquee brands under U.S. law, including one statute that aims to protect owners of Cuban companies nationalized after the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power.Bacardi, the former Cuban distiller that now makes rum in Puerto Rico, controls Havana Club in the United States after acquiring the name from its original pre-revolutionary owner. Everywhere else, Cuba and its French joint venture partner,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), control the rights to Havana Club.""That is a restriction we put on trademarks only with respect to Cuba,"" said Jeremy Sheff, a law professor at St. John's University in New York. ""The U.S. treatment of Cuba is unique in all of international property law."" Cuba's famed Cohiba cigar brand has been fighting for its trademark for 19 years against a rival that won a major U.S. court case by citing the embargo.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

160,"Nov 23, 2015 06:22AM ET",Cognac makers ramp up U.S. efforts as China sips less ,nan,"By Martinne GellerCOGNAC, France (Reuters) - France's centuries-old cognac houses are raising their bets on the U.S. market with new products and campaigns to broaden the drink's appeal beyond its African American stronghold.The big four producers -- LVMH Moet Hennessy (PA:LVMH),  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and Beam Suntory (BSI.UL) -- have turned more of their attention to the U.S. following a drop in sales in China after an anti-graft campaign.On its home turf cognac is seen as the drink of choice for mature gentlemen but in the United States it is often enjoyed by status-conscious revelers inspired by blingy bottles and hip-hop name-dropping songs like Busta Rhymes' ""Pass the Courvoisier.""Black culture's taste for cognac, which only comes from the area around the western French town of that name, dates back at least to the time when U.S. soldiers were visiting jazz-mad Paris bars during the world wars. Back home it was an alternative to American whiskey, often made in southern states with histories of slavery and racial segregation.The African American community accounted for nearly two-thirds of all cognac drunk in the world's biggest market, say executives and analysts. Yet that's now changing. Producers of the drink, made by distilling white wine and aging it in oak barrels for anywhere from two to dozens of years, now need to reach other groups to help fill the space left by China.""We don't want cognac just to be for one category of person,"" Remy Martin Executive Director Augustin Depardon told Reuters during a visit to the Cognac region, where over 75,000 hectares of vineyards grow mostly Ugni Blanc grapes that become the building blocks of cognac.Depardon said a new campaign featuring Hollywood actor Jeremy Renner, one of the stars of The Avengers, was aimed at a broader audience.'PRIORITY NO. 1'Hennessy, Remy Martin, Martell and Courvoisier make 85 percent of all cognac, and they are competing harder than ever, trying to harness the current boom in ""brown spirits"" like bourbon and rum.""We've seen a lot of our cognac competitors be more aggressive in the United States, actually investing in media campaigns on a scale we've never seen before,"" said Jean-Baptiste Rivail, Hennessy's director of business development for the Americas. ""The momentum of Hennessy and brown spirits has attracted quiet players to play harder in the U.S. market.""One of the quiet players is Pernod Ricard's Martell, which at 300 years old, is cognac's elder statesman. After pushing hard in China to become the leading player there, the brand is now trying to lift its 2 percent share of the U.S. market.""It is going to be our priority Number One,"" said Christophe Pienkowski, Martell's international heritage brand ambassador.Initiatives include a new variety called Charactere, which Martell hopes will help convert whisky-drinking Latinos, and a campaign with The Roots, who have recently gone from respected hip-hop group to household name as the official band for the U.S.'s Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.Cognac suppliers sold 4.1 million 9-litre cases in the U.S. last year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, up 11.9 percent from 2013, which only saw a 3.7 percent gain. It was the fastest-growing segment of a spirits market up only 2.2 percent, though from a small base. The trade group's economist said this year may be even stronger. Euromonitor forecasts U.S. retail cognac sales of $5.2 billion in 2015, up 9 percent from last year. That would see it surpass the Chinese market, which it estimates will have lost 36 percent of its value since a peak of $7.8 billion in 2012.COCKTAIL CRAZEThe companies are also trying to push cognac into cocktails. While brandy is the main ingredient for classic drinks like Sidecars and Alexanders, it is not as prevalent on modern cocktail menus as bourbon, tequila and gin. To that end, Hennessy has launched Hennessy Black, which it says is better for cocktails as it has a delicate taste that eases mixability and a stronger alcohol content that can withstand dilution.""Cognac seems, in my mind, to have a rightful place in the cocktail craze that hasn't been fully taken advantage of,"" said Rabobank analyst Stephen Rannekleiv. ""There's an opportunity to continue making inroads in a demographic they have not generally had a strong presence in."" Nielsen data for the most recent 30-day period suggests that white adult consumers drank 27 percent of the nation's cognac even though they represent 66 percent of the adult population. Black consumers drank 40 percent, though they were only 11.2 percent of the population. Despite efforts to broaden their market, the brands will be treading carefully so as not to alienate their core audience, having seen how quickly Cristal champagne fell from grace in 2006 after a boycott by hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, who is now a backer of Bacardi's new cognac D'Usse.""African Americans are still accounting for a huge part of cognac consumption in the U.S. and this is still our main target with D'Usse,"" said Philippe Jouhaud, sales and marketing director for D'Usse.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

162,"Oct 28, 2015 11:00AM ET",Diageo's India unit eyes high-end spirits to reverse market share loss,nan,"By Sumeet ChatterjeeMUMBAI (Reuters) - India's  United Spirits  Ltd (NS:UNSP) will scale back its roster of more than 150 brands and focus on the faster-growing top end, hoping to bolster its fortunes in a market dominated by cheaper, local names. Anand Kripalu, chief executive of the unit of Britain's  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE), said the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky expects growth in top-end spirits to outpace the mass market over the next few years, as a growing class of wealthy young professionals demands better quality.It expects to focus its main marketing and promotion efforts on around 15 top brands and will de-emphasize or consolidate others. Whisky-swigging India, where alcohol was frowned on until only recently for religious and cultural reasons, is now a battleground for global drinks makers, as groups like Diageo and rival  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP) tap emerging markets to offset sluggish growth in the developed world. It is now Diageo's second-largest market by sales. ""Awareness, certainly, for premium brands is going up and affordability is going up,"" Kripalu told Reuters. ""We are focusing on select brands, which we believe are the critical ones, big drivers of growth,"" he said, adding only those brands would receive strategic investment. India's alcoholic beverages market remains small compared with other large economies such as China and the United States. But drinks makers are betting on rapid urbanization, a young population and a fast-growing middle class.PREMIUM BRANDS The spirits market in India, Asia's third-largest economy, was worth about $17 billion in 2014, and per capita consumption is expected to grow to 1.8 liters in 2019 from 1.4 liters in 2010, according to research firm Euromonitor. That jump, Kripalu said, will be fueled by premium brands. In the next five years, the share of higher-end spirits in total volume will go up to 60 percent from 40 percent, while the rest would be accounted for by brands that cost less than 400 rupees ($6.15) a bottle, he said. Diageo's premium portfolio in India also includes Ciroc vodka, while United Spirits owns more popular whisky brands including McDowell's No. 1 and Bagpiper. United Spirits hopes focusing on the higher-band will arrest a decline in its slice of the market, which dropped to 39 percent in 2014, when it was fully integrated with Diageo, from 42.7 percent in 2010, as per the Euromonitor data.As India grows, Kripalu, a consumer goods industry veteran who joined the company two years ago, expects his company's contribution to Diageo's revenue going up in the coming years from about 9 percent now, but did not give a target. ""Our aim is certainly to grow faster than Diageo is growing globally, therefore our contribution will keep going up,"" he said.

164,"Sep 04, 2015 11:18AM ET",Micro-distillers craft limited space in crowded market ,nan,"By Martinne GellerLONDON (Reuters) - Small, independent distillers are popping up and taking market share but liquor giants like  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) say barriers to entry and the range of spirits already available will limit their impact.Mindful of the way big brewers were caught out by the craft beer trend, the world's largest spirits makers are launching lines such as Orphan Barrel and Our/Vodka that tout small batch credentials and refining their marketing of big brands.They are acting while ""craft"" spirits like Sipsmith gin and Hudson whiskey are still relatively niche products.""The U.S. spirits market faces a growing threat of substitution,"" analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said. ""A market that had been characterized by large-scale national brands is becoming increasingly focused on local, authentic, small-batch production.""After compound annual growth of about 50 percent since 2010, craft distillers -- or those producing under 100,000 cases per year -- now account for about 2 percent of the U.S. market, the largest and most profitable in the world.It remains to be seen whether it will ever get as big as craft beer, which makes up 11 percent of the volume and 20 percent of the value of the U.S. market. ""I don't think the response to craft per se is any big brand or little brand,"" said Michael Ward, Diageo's global head of innovation. ""I don't think it has anything to do with the size of a brand.""Diageo, which has posted flat sales for two years, wants to reignite growth with a host of new labels including Blade and Bow and Orphan Barrel, whose marketing relies heavily on their links to the mothballed Stitzel-Weller facility in Kentucky, which was opened in 1935.""Consumers are demanding a better understanding of what's behind the product and our job is to figure out how to tell that story better than we've done,"" Ward added.Pernod, which took a 404 million euro ($449 million) write-down on its Absolut vodka after its U.S. sales fell, says it needs to better differentiate its marketing and may take a ""craft-targeted approach"" on some brands. Craft ""can be an opportunity or a threat -- a threat if we are not adapting our marketing platforms,"" said Gilles Bogaert, Pernod's chief financial officer. ""I think today net net, we see it as an opportunity.""Pernod is playing up the artisanal nature of single malt Scotch with launches like the Glenlivet 50-year-old Winchester Collection. It also launched Our/Vodka, which it says is partly distilled, blended and hand bottled in microdistilleries.SMALL AND GROWINGThe number of U.S. craft distilleries jumped from about 200 in 2011 to about 600 in 2014, lifting sales volume from about 700,000 cases in 2010 to about 3.5 million last year. Craft distillers' sales are nearing $450 million a year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.If current trends continue, Credit Suisse estimates craft could reach a 12 percent share over the next decade, helped by a consolidated distribution system that is allocating more resources to craft and the potential for proposed tax reform.The rise of craft may cause greater pain for Diageo than Pernod, Credit Suisse says, since Diageo is more reliant on the United States, has put through a lot of price increases in recent years and has seen less consistent growth in whiskey, which has more craft credentials.Yet a number of factors could cap the rise of craft spirits.Distilling is more complex and capital intense than brewing as whiskies, rums and many tequilas require years of aging. ""Starting up a craft distillery is a very different cash flow exercise than starting up a craft brewery,"" said Diageo's Ward. For gin, which can be made in one day, craft brands make up about half the ""super-premium"" market in Britain, according to Bernstein Research, but only 5 percent of gin overall. Because craft players lack the scale benefits of larger rivals, their prices are often higher. ""In vodka and gin, the barriers to entry depend entirely on how you want to do something,"" said Zoe Zambakides, head of marketing for London micro-distillery Sipsmith, which just hired its third distiller as it boosts output which she said is as much in a year as big brands make in a day.The fact that there are already so many high-quality drinks at different price points and taste profiles means there is no obvious gap in the market like there was for beer 15 years ago, when light, easy-drinking, mass market lagers dominated.What is more, Bernstein Research said craft beer was arguably ignored by big brewers, with leader  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) only really ramping up its presence in the last 18 months.""The large spirits manufacturers already offer premium niche products that compete head on with craft and have perceived heritage and authenticity,"" Bernstein said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

180,"May 11, 2015 08:27AM ET",Hollande becomes first French president to visit Cuba,nan,"By Elizabeth PineauHAVANA (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande began the first visit by a French head of state to Cuba by noting it was ""special"" in light of Washington's opening to the Communist-ruled island.Hollande, who arrived on Sunday night, was scheduled to meet Cuban President Raul Castro, deliver a speech and participate in an economic forum in Cuba as part of his swing through the Caribbean.He also promised to talk about human rights in Cuba, always a sensitive subject in a country that represses freedom of assembly and controls the media.The French president is traveling with executives from French companies including Air France (PA:AIRF), hotelier  Accor  (PA:ACCP) and distiller  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP). Each of those three already operates in Cuba but they want to expand their business here with an eye to the potential end of the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba.Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama announced in December they would restore diplomatic ties and seek to normalize overall relations after more than 50 years of confrontation, and the two leaders followed that with a meeting at a regional summit in Panama in April.""I come here to Cuba with great emotion because it is the first time that a president of the French Republic comes to Cuba,"" Hollande told reporters upon arriving.""And today it takes a special meaning after what President Obama finally decided,"" he said. France has always maintained relations with Cuba and is one the largest holders of Cuban debt, but the renewed opening with the United States is expected to have ramifications throughout the West. European companies that have long done business in Cuba could have a new competitor if the United States ends the embargo. Obama, a Democrat, has asked Congress to remove it but has encountered resistance from Republicans, who control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.Hollande will also meet Cuba's Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Ortega, and the Cuban chapter of the Alliance Francaise, which promotes French culture abroad.He could also visit retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro, 88, whose 1959 revolution is generally well regarded in France, especially within Hollande's Socialist Party.Fidel Castro stepped down provisionally in 2006 and definitively in 2008, handing power to his younger brother Raul.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

186,"Mar 19, 2015 07:11AM ET",French retailer Carrefour returning to Algeria - source ,nan,"By Dominique VidalonPARIS (Reuters) -  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) is preparing to return to Algeria after a six-year absence, as part of a drive to tap booming consumer demand in Africa.The world's second-largest retailer after Wal-Mart (N:WMT) will open a hypermarket in Algiers by the end of June, a source close to the matter told Reuters.The company operating the store is a joint-venture, 70 percent-owned by Carrefour Tunisia and 30 percent by a fund controlled by the Algerian state, the source said.Carrefour declined to comment.Carrefour entered Algeria in 2006, teaming up with local private holding company Arcofina. However, in 2009 the pair ditched the venture after opening only one of a planned 18 stores. Arcofina cited development roadblocks such as difficulties in securing land.Rising incomes and an underdeveloped retail sector have made Africa an important new growth destination for retailers and consumer goods companies, with the likes of  Danone  (PA:DANO), Pernod (PA:PERP) and  Diageo  (L:DGE) boosting investments to counter weak growth in Europe.The World Bank forecasts Algeria's economy will grow 3.3 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2016 -- more than double rates expected for the euro zone.Small independent grocers dominate Algeria's retail sector, where Carrefour would compete with Numidis, the retail unit of agro-food conglomerate Cevital, which had a 1 percent share of the 2014 local retail market by value, according to Euromonitor.LOW RISK Newcomers to Africa face many challenges including legal hurdles, lack of available property and transport infrastructure and setting up a reliable supplier base.Carrefour has thus chosen to expand on the continent through franchise deals with strong local connections to which it brings retailing skills while keeping investment to a minimum.This is because Europe's largest retailer has earmarked the bulk of its tight resources for expansion in its key markets of Europe, Brazil and China. ""Carrefour is unlikely to sustain ambitious expansion plans for the African continent in the short-term as it already has a lot on its plate in its key markets,"" said PlanetRetail analyst Gildas Aitamer.Carrefour has had franchise deals since 2009 with Morocco's Label'Vie (CS:LBV) for 62 stores and in Tunisia with Ulysse Hyper Distribution (UHD) since 1997 with 71 stores.In east Africa, it relies on long-time partner Dubai-based Majid al Futtaim (MAJ), its exclusive franchise holder for the Middle East, which operates Carrefour hypermarkets in Egypt and plans to open stores in Kenya this year. In 2013, Carrefour teamed up with Africa-focused trading firm CFAO (PA:CFAO) to open stores in eight west African countries. CFAO plans to open the first shopping center in Abidjan in the second half of 2015.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

193,"Sep 03, 2014 06:20PM ET",Spirits companies encounter more competition in U.S. vodka market,nan,"By Anjali Athavaley and Martinne Geller (Reuters) - The leading vodka brands in the United States are losing their buzz as craft distillers and other alcoholic drinks infringe on their turf.Both Diageo Plc (L:DGE), which markets Smirnoff, and Pernod Ricard SA (PA:PERP), known for its Absolut brand, say newcomers to the vodka market are cutting into their sales. The companies have been losing share over the last five years to smaller brands such as Fifth Generation Inc's Tito's Handmade Vodka.""Let's be honest. We are not pleased with the performance of Absolut in the U.S.,"" Pierre Pringuet, Pernod's chief executive officer, told reporters in London Wednesday.He added that ""the reality is that there are several hundred new entrants into the market. Basically, 99 percent if not more of these brands do not survive, but the problem is they do take market share.""Overall, vodka is facing slower growth in the United States as consumers' liquor preferences change. Sales increased just 1.4 percent to $17.3 billion in 2013, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, marking the slowest pace since at least 2000.That is because newer generations of drinkers are increasingly shifting toward brown liquors such as bourbon and whiskey in what analysts call the ""Mad Men effect"" - a reference to the Prohibition-era drinks consumed on the popular television show. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, an industry trade group, sales volumes of whiskey in 2013 were up 6 percent, outpacing vodka's 1 percent growth.""Vodka's appeal to a lot of people has been that it doesn't taste like anything,"" said Drew Dupuy, a 35-year-old communications manager in Washington, D.C. He used to drink Bloody Marys with vodka at brunch with his friends but now orders the drink with tequila or gin. ""There's a wide range of liquors with interesting profiles that you can make really flavorful cocktails with.""Such changes in behavior have weighed on Diageo and Pernod's most recent earnings results. For the year ended June 30, Smirnoff net sales declined by 2 percent globally, driven by increasing price pressure in its largest markets of North America and Western Europe. Meanwhile, Pernod said organic sales of Absolut fell 1 percent during the period.Diageo's Chief Executive Ivan Menezes told reporters in July that the company planned to scale back on the pace of the price increases it has implemented in the past three years so that Smirnoff could become more competitive.Still, growth in the United States will be hard to find, said Spiros Malandrakis, alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor. In recent years, companies that sell vodka have tried to attract consumers by introducing more flavors. But sales of flavored vodka are slowing.""People just jump from one flavor to the next, and eventually we just get bored of all of them,"" he said. He said, of vodka, ""Essentially, it has reached the limits of what the category can do.""(Reporting by Anjali Athavaley in New York and Martinne Geller in London; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

195,"Aug 04, 2014 07:48AM ET",Upped KKR offer for Australia's Treasury Wine raises bidding war prospect,nan,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Treasury Wine Estates (AX:TWE) is opening its books to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co LP (N:KKR) after the private equity giant hiked its takeover offer to $3.15 billion, raising the prospect of a bidding war for the world's No.2 winemaker. Treasury, which rejected a $2.9 billion unsolicited bid from KKR in April, said the 10.6 percent rise in the offer price meant it was now ""in the interests of shareholders to engage further."" Asia's growing appetite for wine, the value of Treasury's Penfolds label and an ongoing restructuring are helping turn perceptions of the company's prospects around after a horror 2013 saw profits slump 38 percent in the six months to February. China's Bright Food Group Co Ltd [SHMNGA.UL], France's Pernod Ricard (PA:PERP) and the world's biggest wine maker, U.S.-based Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ), have all been mooted as potential buyers of Treasury. ""Absolutely there are (rival bidders), they've now kind of set a starting point for the price,"" said Shannon Rivkin, director at Rivkin Securities. ""This is going to be the point now where anyone who has any interest will be able to have a look at the books as well."" Treasury, which also owns the Wolfblass and Beringer brands, stressed it was providing KKR and new bidding partner Rhone Capital LLC with ""non-exclusive"" access to its books for due diligence and that there was no certainty any offer would be forthcoming. Treasury rejected KKR's A$4.70 per share bid as too low in May after KKR began approaching investors directly. The new A$5.20 offer is a five percent premium to Treasury's A$4.95 share price close on Friday. Treasury shares were up around four percent at A$5.15 on Monday. Treasury's shares have fallen from an all-time high of A$6.43 a year ago amid slashed earnings forecasts, oversupply problems in its U.S arm and sluggish sales in China. If a firm offer did result, Treasury said it would assess whether it provided superior value to plans the company already had to cut costs and improve its performance, which included separating its Australian luxury and mass prestige portfolio from its lower value commercial brand portfolio. Rivkin cautioned that a closer look at the books could also raise concerns - and possibly a lower price - pointing to the recent takeover of struggling food maker Goodman Fielder Ltd (AX:GFF) by Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok's Wilmar International Ltd (SI:WLIL). Wilmar and Hong Kong investment firm First Pacific convinced Goodman to accept a lower offer after a look at the books resulted in the Australasian firm warning of a massive impairment charge due to pressures on its baking unit. ""I think this is a starting bid, once they have a look through, if there are any issues there that the market's not aware of they could still very easily walk away,"" Rivkin said of the KKR offer for Treasury. WINE WOES Treasury's problems are reflected in the broader Australian wine industry, which has struggled through volatile market conditions and a high currency in recent years. Treasury - which posted sales worth A$1.7 billion in the 2013 financial year - has tried to stave off takeovers by cutting costs and installing new CEO Michael Clarke in April. Former CEO David Dearie was sacked in September last year after presiding over a A$160 million charge due to the destruction of thousands of gallons of cheap wine exported to the United States. An efficiency drive imposed by Clarke is expected to generate A$35 million in savings in the 2015 financial year by shedding jobs and rationalizing office space, I.T. and non-essential spending. The company, which is scheduled to release full-year results on Aug. 21, is also counting on its Penfolds release to boost sales in the second half of the 2013-14 financial year.

196,"Jul 01, 2014 01:30AM ET",Food makers feel their way towards online future,nan,"By Martinne Geller PARIS (Reuters) - Grocery manufacturers are struggling to adapt to the online world and need to invest in smarter packaging, presentation and supply chains to reap the long term benefits. E-commerce accounts for just 3.7 percent of sales for fast-moving items like food, drinks and personal care products, market researcher Kantar Worldpanel says, forecasting a rise to 5 percent by 2016 as supermarkets develop their web sites and online only retailers like Amazon and Ocado take them on. Greater e-commerce could save money with more targeted marketing, including via social media, and lower product development costs, but industry insiders say manufacturers are put off innovation by the so-far small volumes of goods sold over the internet. At a recent meeting of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) in Paris, Amazon Vice President of Consumables Doug Herrington berated them over the presentation of their goods, saying his firm had to photograph items to show their scale. ""This is a space you should have been a leader in and instead I find we have to innovate on your behalf,"" he said, noting items often arrived leaking or in unattractive bubble wrap. ""The first moment of truth for the customer is not what's on the site, it's what arrives at their home.""   UNPREPARED Most food makers remain ""seriously unprepared for online retailing,"" said Rabobank analyst John David Roeg saying they would have to expand their product assortments, since online shoppers are more likely to use search terms like ""organic yogurt"" or ""gluten-free bread"". Iglo Group, which hopes its Birds Eye frozen foods will generate 25 percent of sales online by 2017 from 10 percent now, said it was streamlining product names and information alongside testing promotions encouraging bulk purchases. ""If you have the wrong words at the beginning, someone who is accessing through a mobile (phone) might just see 'frozen pea' and have no idea what size pack it is, if it's peas and sweet corn, peas and carrots or just peas,"" general marketing manager Cheryl Calverley said. ""It's a really new market though, so everyone's trying new things,"" she told Reuters. Some manufacturers are toying with their own ecommerce sites but only in niche areas, with firms like L'Oreal, Nestle and Procter & Gamble selling small amounts of cosmetics, coffee, chocolate and shampoo directly. Nestle's Nespresso coffee brand is unusual in that it gets 60 percent of its sales from its own websites, but the company said the plan was not to bypass retailers. The world's largest food maker, which gets about 3 to 4 percent of its sales online, says it has created ad hoc online product name and descriptions, advanced images and how-to videos that link to retailers' websites but was proceeding cautiously. ""We know that we have to engage with players that are going to set these platforms up,"" Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said in an interview. ""Because of our success and history, that could be a liability - because you hold on to what you know."" Asked about bespoke products or packaging, Nestle cited its Gerber brand as an example of how ""the online space requires ad hoc packaging"" with an infant formula package available just on Amazon.  WINNERS AND LOSERS An online migration would ultimately lead to better consumer data and therefore less product inventory throughout the supply chain, Roeg said, reducing working capital and new product development costs by allowing for small, targeted trials.  Fabio Vacirca, global managing director of Accenture's consumer goods & services practice, also said margins would improve, despite a wider offering. ""A digital shelf is virtually infinite, so we will probably see more (product) complexity."" But cheaper digital marketing, unlimited shelf space and the elimination of slotting fees paid to retailers could narrow the gap between them and start-ups that appeal to younger consumers. Analysts from Bernstein Research warn this could ultimately eat into the earnings power of companies like Campbell Soup and ConAgra Foods. And while makers of frozen foods like Iglo, Nestle and Unilever could gain from the convenience of home delivery, candy makers such as Mars and Mondelez International could suffer as online shoppers resist impulse buys.   HIGH END VS MASS MARKET L'Oreal, which has an e-shop, recently named a chief digital officer to help it grow online, especially in China where online could soon reach 10 percent of sales of its mass-market products. Overall, online is still less than 2 percent, CEO Jean-Paul Agon told Reuters.  Heineken last year launched ""the Sub,"" an at-home beer dispenser for which refill ""torps"" can be ordered from a Heineken website, and in January spirits company Pernod Ricard unveiled a concept called ""Project Gutenberg"" that would let consumers replenish their spirits online. While such sites provide valuable data, the high cost of shipping is a deterrent for most packaged goods unless an air of exclusivity or community affords them higher prices.  ""Nespresso is an aspirational product. Whey protein is an aspirational product. Bananas are not,"" said Berenberg Bank analyst Fintan Ryan.  That does not mean inexpensive products cannot thrive online. According to CheckoutSmart, a provider of digital grocery rewards, Coca-Cola is the top online grocery brand in the UK, accounting for 97 pence of every 100 pounds spent in UK online groceries over the last year.  The world's top soft-drink maker has made a big digital push, including on Facebook, where its French unit last year ran a campaign to lift sales that Facebook said earned it 2.74 euros for every 1 euro it spent. By targeting ads to big spenders, Facebook says an identical household reach would drive 2.3 times more sales than television. Its global head of consumer packaged goods strategy, Erin Hunter, says online marketing driving both online and offline sales helps traditional companies make the transition to a new era. ""That change doesn't have to be as complex and scary,"" she said. ($1 = 0.7331 Euros)    (Additional reporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Philippa Fletcher) "

midday on Thursday. At 1050 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 1.3 percent at 1,012.61 points after ending just
shy of a one-year closing high in the previous session. The European benchmark index is up more than 56 percent from
its lifetime low of March 9, as investors have become more
confident on the prospects of economic recovery and most
third-quarter earnings have beaten forecasts.  ""(But) Ericsson was a shocker,"" said David Buik, senior

in operating profits for its financial year to June 2010. Overall group quarterly revenue fell 6.3 percent to 1.646
billion euros ($2.46 billion), in line with the average forecast
in a Reuters analyst poll of 1.644 billion. Pernod's spirits brands held up better than expected with
quarterly sales down 2 percent helped by rises in Martell cognac
and Havana Club rum. Wine and champagne sales fell 13 percent
with Perrier-Jouet plunging 38 percent. Chief Executive Pierre Pringuet told Reuters that wholesale
distributors in the U.S. were ""broadly confident"" on the
remainder of 2009, though they were delaying placing orders, and
sales to retailers were positive for the first time since 2008. He also said Absolut vodka would benefit from a second wave
of advertising. ""I want Absolut to grow in the U.S. this year."" He added the group's first-quarter performance ""strengthens
our confidence for the current financial year and our
determination to increase advertising and promotion investment
in our strategic brands"". Pernod said Europe, which accounts for nearly a third of
group revenue, saw a underlying sales decline 11 percent and
""remains the region most affected"" by the economic downturn. ""Europe is the problem area while Americas and Asia Pacific
are better than anticipated,"" said Gerard Rijk, an analyst with
ING in Amsterdam.

 (Adds further details, updates shares) LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Diageo Plc, the world's biggest
spirits group, said on Wednesday its underlying sales fell a
sharper-than-expected 6 percent in its first quarter, sending
its shares lower, while it kept its annual profit target. The British maker of Smirnoff vodka, Captain Morgan rum and
Guinness beer reported the sales decline for its July-September
first quarter, compared to analyst forecasts for an average 2.3
percent fall in sales in a Reuters poll of six brokers. ""As we anticipated consumer trends across our markets remain
broadly unchanged since the year-end. Therefore net sales in the
first quarter of the new financial year have been weak when
compared to the strong performance of the first quarter last
year,"" said Chief Executive Paul Walsh in a trading update. ""The year has started as we thought it would and we
reiterate our guidance for low single digit organic growth in
operating profit in fiscal 2010,"" Walsh added. The London-based group cut its annual target twice in six
months earlier this year as de-stocking and downtrading to
cheaper products in the downturn hurt the drinks maker. Walsh added that stock levels had not risen in the first
quarter and in its biggest market, North America, stocks for its
U.S. spirits business were below those seen at end-June 2009. ""This is clearly a weak figure, but is heavily driven by the
phasing of orders. Last year saw heavy buying by consumers ahead
of Christmas before the crisis hit. This year customers are
understandably being more cautious,"" said analyst Matthew Webb
at brokers Cazenove He expects consumers to increase orders during key
pre-Christmas trading, assuming demand stays resilient, and
added on a positive note that the weak start was anticipated by
the company and there was no change in its full-year guidance. Diageo shares dipped 4.7 percent to an eight-week low of
930-1/2 pence, before last trading down 3.6 percent at 941-1/2p
by 0930 GMT, making the Johnnie Walker whisky and Baileys
liqueur group worth around 24 billion pounds ($38.34 billion). Other European spirits group shares were lower with Pernod
Ricard off 3.5 percent at 53.72 euros. It is due to report on
recent trends on Oct 22. Analysts had warned this quarter was set to be the low point
for Diageo as the previous first-quarter of July-Sept 2008 saw
sales rise 6 percent before the market saw a fall in November
2008 as the slowdown worsened after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers. In its last financial year to end-June 2009, the group saw
flat underlying sales and operating profit growth of 4 percent,
but has said it expected trading to stabilise in the last six
months of 2009 and hoped for a real recovery in 2010. The group was giving a trading update ahead of its annual
general meeting later this afternoon. Diageo shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 index by 12
percent and rival Pernod Ricard by 7 percent so far this year.

fourth straight session on Thursday, pressured by energy and
pharma stocks, with analysts detecting no early resumption of
the market upswing without solid evidence of economic recovery. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.1
percent lower at 949.82 points after trading in a wide range of
947.37-958.02. It is up 14 percent this year and has surged 47
percent since hitting a record low in early March. Drugmakers took the most points off the index, with
AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk,
Roche Holding and Sanofi-Aventis down 0.6-2.2 percent. ""We are going to see nothing but a phase of consolidation,
may be for several weeks,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist
at Brewin Dolphin. ""The survey data has been consistently positive all along
and the market has been pricing all these things in anticipation
of a recovery. We actually need to get a confirmation of the
survey data in the real economic numbers, such as GDP figures,
for the markets to move on now,"" he added. Data showed the euro zone services economy jumped back
almost to recovery in August and was on course to grow in this
quarter led by a resurgent Germany and France. Energy shares also featured among top losers, with BP, Royal
Dutch Shell, BG Group, Total and StatoilHydro shedding 1.0-1.2
percent. ""The rhetoric of recovery seems to have lost some of its
sheen of late ... Investors will be hoping that European finance
ministers will be able to devise a blueprint for a relatively
painless adjustment,"" said Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at
IG Index. ""In the meantime though, the cloud of uncertainty hovering
above equities may have put an end to the raging bull market of
the past months.""  Britain, France and Germany said that although the world
economy was stabilising, the crisis was not yet over and urged
governments to implement fully their recovery plans while
ensuring that they did not create the conditions for new global
imbalances in the future.  FINANCIALS ADVANCE Banks were among top gainers, with HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank
of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Postbank gaining 0.3-9.9 percent. The market got some support from better than-expected-sales
data from key U.S. retailers in August, but continued weakness
in the labour market limited the impact. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said its services
index rose to 48.4 in August, slightly above the 48.0 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters, while initial
jobless claims fell to 570,000 from a revised 574,000 the week
before, but that was above economists' forecast for 560,000. Investors awaited Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls data. ""Any signs that the U.S. labour market is still in dire
straits could make the bulls minds up to cash in on their gains
and even attract speculative sellers compounding a move lower,""
Angus Campbell, head of sales, Capital Spreads, said in a note. The market showed little reaction to the European Central
Bank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low
of 1.0 percent. Pernod Ricard, the world's second-largest spirits group,
fell 4.5 percent after it predicted a tough year as the drinks
market stagnates and said it would focus on disposals and
generating cash to reduce its debt pile. British music, books and games retailer HMV fell 2.8 percent
after posting a 1.8 percent fall in underlying sales for the
first 18 weeks of its financial year. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 fell 0.4-0.6 percent.

 (Adds U.S. rival results, detail, analyst comment) By James Regan PARIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - French spirits group Pernod Ricard
 on Thursday predicted a tough year as the drinks market
stagnates and said it would focus on disposals and generating
cash to reduce its debt pile. The world's second-largest spirits group behind Diageo
posted a 21 percent rise in recurring operating profit for the
year to June 30, in line with forecasts, due to growth in
France, Asia and Latin America. But Chief Executive Pierre Pringuet told a news conference
he would wait until the annual shareholder meeting on Nov. 2 to
give forecasts for the current year, as Pernod had done in the
past. The business trend in July and August had not changed from
the final quarter, he added. ""For 2009/10, Pernod Ricard anticipates a general economic
environment that will remain difficult and an overall stagnation
of the Wines & Spirits industry, with contrasting situations
depending on countries and categories,"" Pernod said. Diageo warned last week that it would not see a recovery
until 2010 at the earliest, prompting it to cut its growth
target. The maker of Smirnoff vodka and Guinness beer added that
trading would likely stabilise in the second half of 2009. Pringuet told a conference call that his views of the market
were similar to Diageo's and added that the market would be
stable at best this fiscal year. U.S. group Brown-Forman Corp, the maker of Jack Daniel's
whiskey and Southern Comfort, left its fiscal full-year earnings
forecast unchanged on Wednesday despite posting a much
better-than-expected first-quarter profit. Pernod, which owns Absolut vodka, Malibu liqueur and aniseed
drink Ricard, said full-year recurring operating profit was
1.846 billion euros ($2.63 billion), compared with the 1.856
billion average estimate from 10 analysts in a Reuters poll. Recurring net profit was up 13 percent at 1.01 billion
euros, slightly ahead of the poll estimate of 998.9 million. Brown-Forman warned that deep discounting throughout the
industry could reappear or even accelerate in the upcoming
holiday season. Shares in Pernod Ricard fell 4.5 percent on Thursday, the
worst performers on the French benchmark CAC 40 index. ""The group is not offering any guidance for FY 2010 at this
stage, and the CEO is warning about a tough H1 and a generally
difficult and stagnant market for spirits,"" said analyst Simon
Hales at Evolution Securities. CM-CIC Securities analyst Francis Pretre was upbeat. ""We remain fundamentally positive on this group, which posts
good performances both in industrialised and emerging countries
-- especially China, which has not been the case at Diageo,""
Pretre said. The company confirmed that its priority remained to reduce
debt by selling assets and generating cash, as well as to invest
in its 15 strategic brands. Pringuet told BFM Radio the group would not make a further
cash call to shareholders to reduce its 10.9 billion euros of
net debt. Instead the company will pursue its 1 billion euro asset
disposal programme and aim to generate free cash flow from
recurring operations of close to 3 billion euros over the three
years to 2010/11. The group had generated 700 million euros from asset sales
so far, including the disposal of the Tia Maria coffee liqueur
brand in July, it said. The company said it aimed to lower its average cost of
borrowing from 4.8 percent last year to close to 4.5 percent in
the current year. For an analysis on Pernod Ricard, please double click on

64.6p * Underlying sales flat, operating profit up 4 percent * Targets operating profit growth in low single digits * Shares dip over 4 percent 
 (Adds Chief Exec comments, analysts, updates shares) By David Jones LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Diageo Plc, the world's biggest
spirits group, warned recovery would come in 2010 at the
earliest, prompting it to cut its growth target after meeting
forecasts with a 10 percent rise in annual earnings. The London-based maker of Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker
whisky and Guinness beer sounded a note of caution on Thursday,
with uncertainty driven by weak European markets such as Spain,
Ireland and Russia, which sent Diageo shares sharply down. Chief Executive Paul Walsh said he expected trading to
stabilise in the last six months of 2009, but the underlying
trends were positive as he hoped for recovery in 2010. ""In the second half of our fiscal year (Jan-June 2010), we
would hope to start to expect real fundamental improvement to
put us in a strong position for fiscal 2011,"" Walsh told a news
conference after annual results. He added that although the global economy appeared to be
stabilising, there was still uncertainty as to the
sustainability and pace of any recovery, and so had no plans to
restart its share buyback programme. Diageo shares dipped as much as 4.9 percent to 948 pence
before recovering some losses. At 1400 GMT they traded down 4.3
percent at 954p, the second-biggest loser in the FTSE 100 index
 dragging other spirits groups lower. Shares in French rival Pernod Ricard dipped 3.8 percent to
53 euros, while in the U.S. Fortune Brands was off 1.8 percent
and Brown Forman down 0.2 percent. ""We are also taking a cautious view, but we believe that
with destocking trends abating, the worst may be behind the
spirits companies, and Diageo is best-positioned for a rebound
in sales trends,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Anthony Bucalo. The group posted basic earnings for the year to end-June of
65.2 pence a share in line with a range of 57.6 to 72.6 and a
consensus of 64.6p in a Reuters survey of seven analysts, while
it raised its final dividend 5 percent to 22.2p. The British group's annual underlying sales were flat, and
its volumes slipped 4 percent, but the weak pound and cost
cutting pushed operating profit up 4 percent, at the bottom of
its 4 to 6 percent growth range. Heineken, the world's third-largest brewer, also published
results a day earlier showing profit had been supported by cost
cuts and price rises despite lower sales volumes.  CUTS TARGET Diageo, which cut its operating growth target from 7 to 9
percent only in February due to weak European demand and
destocking in the U.S., again reset the target to a low single
digit percentage for the current year to June 2010. Its sales growth shuddered to a halt then tipped downwards
over the year as the recession hit drinkers, and profit growth
slowed as consumers turned to cheaper priced drinks. Finance Director Nick Rose said prices would rise this year 
only by around 1 percent in a bid to protect volumes, which fell
4 percent last year. He hoped this action plus more marketing
spending and innovation would see volumes flat this year. Diageo said its biggest market in North America was still
very resilient, with the destocking seen earlier this year now
largely over. Earlier this week, the world's biggest brewer
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV said it planned to raise beer prices in
the U.S., reflecting a more robust economy. Diageo shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 by 6 percent
so far this year, but have risen from a low of 727p in March to
top 10 pounds earlier this week. They have outperformed rival
Pernod by 7 percent in 2009. The French group, No 2 in the spirits market with brands
such as Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal whisky, said in July it
expected flat sales in its year to June 2009, with operating
profits at the lower end of its 3-5 percent growth range. It
reports full results next week on Sept. 3.

 (Recasts with CEO interview comments) By Marie-Louise Gumuchian MILAN, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Drinks group Campari is well placed
to continue the positive momentum that saw consumption of its
brands outpace the market in key regions in the first half, when
its net profit beat analyst estimates. ""We have all the cards in order to continue with positive
consumption momentum,"" Bob Kunze-Concewitz, chief executive of
the company best known for its bitter red aperitif, said in an
interview. ""Our brands are very well positioned both from a category
standpoint as well as a pricing standpoint to continue growing."" Davide Campari-Milano SpA, which made its biggest
acquisition ever in April when it bought the Wild Turkey bourbon
brand, does not see ""anything meaningful"" happening in terms of
acquisitions for at least 18 months, Kunze-Concewitz said. Campari, which has a portfolio of spirits, wines and soft
drinks brands, said underlying consumption of its brands in the
first half was ""positive"", outperforming the overall market
trend in key regions. In a slide presentation it said the U.S. spirits market grew
1.5 percent in the first half, while consumption of its spirits
rose 11.7 percent. In Italy, the overall spirits market fell 3.8
percent while Campari spirits slipped 1.2 percent and its
aperitifs saw demand rise 5.7 percent. It said destocking pressure eased in key developed markets. Campari's first-half net profit increased 0.5 percent to
60.1 million euros on sales up 2.5 percent to 441.8 million
euros, thanks to improved conditions in the second quarter,
integration of acquisitions and cost containment.  GOOD MONTH JP Morgan said in a note the first half was better than
expected, above a consensus forecast for sales of 436 million
euros and for net profit of 59.8 million. Shares were up 1.9 percent to 6.01 euros at 1236 GMT, paring
gains after hitting a year high. Campari is sticking to a medium-to-long term target of 5
percent organic growth, Kunze-Concewitz said, adding July was a
""good month."" ""With regard to this year where trading conditions aren't
normal, we're reserving judgment for the time being,"" he said. Campari said it would remain vigilant and would focus on
cost containment, working capital and cash generation. Campari bought the Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey brand from
Pernod Ricard for $575 million this year to boost its U.S.
presence. ""We're a conservative company and we've clearly declared
that before making any sizeable acquisition we would be looking
at reducing our debt levels,"" Kunze-Concewitz said.  ""We continue maintaining a watchful eye (on the M&A scene)
but I don't see anything meaningful happening at least for
another 18 months on our side."" Pernod Ricard said it expected full-year operating profit to
be at the lower end of its 3.5 percent growth target range on
the back of flat comparable sales.

220,"Jul 10, 2009 09:56AM ET",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Hearing how companies are faring,nan," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - There is a huge test ahead for
investors next week as one of the two big questions facing them
is answered -- how companies are faring in the global recession. They will also be newly cognisant after this week's Bank of
England meeting of the idea that central banks will eventually
exit from their economic reflation strategies, a concept that
has already set off some jitters. Concerns that the global economy may not be heading for as
quick a recovery as some had hoped have combined recently with
angst about corporate earnings to bring the red-hot March-June
equity rally to a screeching halt. World stocks as measured by MSCI, for example, are down
around 4 percent so far in the third quarter after soaring a
record 21.2 percent in the second. Next week, though, the U.S. earnings season gets underway
big time and the results are likely to set the tone for markets
for much of the rest of the year.
 ""We'll need to see substantial improvements in economic and
company fundamentals in order to sustain recent gains and expand
the breadth of the rally,"" Enrique Chang, chief investment
officer at American Century Investments said in a note. As of Friday, two major U.S. companies had reported -- and
given investors the same kind of mixed signals they are getting
from economic data. First, industrial bellwether Alcoa reported a third
consecutive quarterly loss, but beat estimates by a large margin
due to cost cuts. Them oil major Chevron warned that
second-quarter earnings would be hit by a sharp decline in U.S.
refining margins. So it will be on to next week to get a clearer idea.  DELUGE It offers a veritable who's who of American corporate
aristocracy. Among those reporting are big financials Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan, Bank of America and Citi (C.N, technology bellwethers
IBM, Google and Intel, as well as big names such as GE, and
Johnson and Johnson.
 Europe will also see the start of its season, with the likes
of Nokia, Alstom, Novartis and Pernod Ricard reporting. Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research says that analysts are
now expecting a huge year-over-year decline in earnings from S&P
500 companies, something in the region of 35 percent. But the research also notes that analysts have not been
slashing their second-quarter earnings expectations with the
same rapidity they did before the previous two quarters. This could mean that they have now factored in the likely
impact of the global recession on earnings. Alternatively, it
could mean that analysts are far too optimistic about what is
happening on a company level. A study by consultants Absolute Strategy Research found a
large and unusual variance between analysts' earnings revisions
and corporate newsflows, with the latter now far more
pessimistic than the former. ""Analysts are looking towards an upturn in global earnings
that, as yet, our newsflow indicators are not detecting,"" the
firm warned.
 RUSH FOR THE EXIT On the economic data front -- where investors are seeking
hard confirmation that recovery is in the works -- the focus
will be on U.S. inflation, retail sales and industrial
production. But investors are also having to deal with a new wrinkle,
the idea that central banks are becoming reluctant to extend the
kind of help to economies that they have been and will
eventually have to roll some of them back. This stems from the unexpected decision by the Bank of
England this week not to extend its quantitative easing,
essentially the non-interest rate way it pumps money into the
economy. There was a sharp jump in Treasury, euro zone debt and gilt
yields on the news, showing what bond markets are likely to have
to deal with when the event comes. It is some way off, but a warning shot has been heard.

224,"Feb 24, 2009 07:08PM ET","RPT-FEATURE-U.S. companies get Cuba trademarks, wait for change",nan," By Esteban Israel HAVANA, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The opening of a McDonald's in
Communist Cuba seems unlikely any time soon, even with U.S.
President Barack Obama in the White House and the prospect of
better U.S.-Cuba relations on the horizon. But the fast food giant is one of many U.S. companies that
have an estimated 5,000 products trademarked in Cuba, waiting
for the day they might finally land on the island separated
from the United States by the Florida Straits and a vast
ideological gulf. The list includes ubiquitous symbols of capitalism such as
Nike, Visa, and Starbucks and some that might surprise,
including former basketball stars Magic Johnson and Patrick
Ewing and the caped crime-fighter Batman. As recently as December the Cuban Office of Intellectual
Property registered trademarks for new products for Coca-Cola,
Google and Ford Motor Co. Many U.S. trademarks date back to before the Jan. 1, 1959
revolution that put Fidel Castro in power and transformed the
island from a capitalist U.S. ally into a communist foe. Their names -- among them Aunt Jemima, Timex, Quaker Oats,
M&M's, Polaroid, Kodak, General Motors, Texaco -- invoke a time
when Cuba was a consumer society with an affinity for U.S.
goods, most of them unavailable since the U.S. imposed a trade
embargo against the island in 1962. The biggest wave of registrations came in the early 1990s
when the Soviet Union, which subsidized Cuba's economy to the
tune of $4 billion a year, collapsed and Castro's communist
system seemed in trouble. Cuban communism survived and since then the registration of
U.S. trademarks has ebbed and flowed with the state of
U.S.-Cuba relations, rising when they improved and falling when
they worsened. TENSIONS DURING BUSH ERA The number of applications fell by 36 percent during the
George W. Bush administration. His hard-line policies toward
Cuba increased tensions between the two countries. The advent of Obama is expected to bring a fresh look at
Cuba from U.S. companies interested in opening new markets. He is the first U.S. president in half a century who has
said he is willing to talk with Cuba's leaders, and he has
promised to ease the trade embargo. There has been a ""marked increase in interest among major
U.S. companies in the trade and investment climate in Cuba
since the election of President Obama,"" said Jake Colvin, Vice
President for Global Trade Issues at the National Foreign Trade
Council, which promotes rule-based trade. If history is a guide, that interest will translate into
another wave of new U.S. registrations in Cuba, but not until
the global financial crisis has passed, industrial property
experts in both countries said. To a certain extent, U.S. companies which seek a Cuban
trademark are betting on the future. Even with Obama in office,
they do not expect the Cuban market, that has been mostly
off-limits for 47 years, to open up overnight. ""There is no expectation by senior management of large
United States corporations that a return to Cuba is imminent,""
said John Kavulich, senior policy advisor for the U.S.-Cuba
Trade and Economic Council, which monitors trade between the
two countries. But companies that already have trademarks are expected to
keep renewing them every 10 years as required, both to keep
their foot in the door and to protect against piracy. Registering a trademark cost only about $1,500. ""They have to protect their rights. They don't want to
create another Taiwan 90 miles (144 km) from the United States
-- you don't want people manufacturing (fake) Nike shoes
there,"" said Jesus Sanchelima, a Cuban-American lawyer in Miami
who has registered numerous trademarks on the island. BURGER KING AND BACARDI The National Foreign Trade Council often cites the example
of South Africa, where after the end of apartheid rule some
U.S. companies such as Burger King found their trademarks had
been registered by someone else. Regaining control over the
brands took a lot of time and money. ""Protecting trademarks in the absence of trade is important
to ensure that a company like Starbucks will be able to
establish a business and maintain control of its reputation in
Cuba in the future,"" Colvin said. Experts say the Cuban authorities have honored trademarks.
When they found that some brands had been registered by people
with no legal claims to them, they awarded the rights to the
legitimate owners. The biggest trademark dispute involved Bacardi, the rum
maker which fled Cuba after the revolution and then years later
laid claim to Cuba's best-known rum brand, Havana Club. The claim touched off a politically-charged legal battle
between Bacardi and the Cuban government and its joint venture
partner, French liquor giant Pernod Ricard, that is not yet
fully resolved. In response to this controversy, an angry Fidel Castro,
before illness forced him from office a year ago, vowed to
start producing Coca-Cola in Cuba to retaliate against what he
viewed as U.S. maliciousness. So far, with Fidel's brother Raul Castro now Cuba's
president, that vow remains only a threat. (Editing by Jeff Franks and Alan Elsner)

225,"Jan 19, 2009 07:08PM ET",RPT-FEATURE-Australia's wine industry at a crisis crossroad,nan,"   (Repeats story that moved at 0000) By Rob Taylor MURRUMBATEMAN, Jan 20 (Reuters) - From a picturesque hill
overlooking the hazy distant foothills of Australia's eastern
ranges, Bruce March can see a crisis facing the country's A$2.4
billion ($1.6bln) wine export industry with crushing clarity. March, chief winemaker at Doonkuna Winery, in prize cool
climate vine country north of Canberra, had been looking
forward to a bumper 2009 harvest, tripling production capacity
last year in anticipation of rocketing China demand for his
wine. But the global financial crisis has exploded that interest,
bringing with it a soul-searching for Australia's vignerons,
ironically when good rains and a late summer are set to bring
one of the best harvests for years. ""We set up to produce all this wine. We spent a lot of
money, and then bang, the financial crisis hit us,"" March told
Reuters, standing near his largely new winemaking plant. ""Our
Chinese importer is hoping for a better next year. Right now
we're tightening belts and we're into survival mode"". The latest export figures are depressing reading for
Australia's wine industry, which for decades led the so-called
""New World"" challenge to wine's traditional French, German and
Italian strongholds. Australia shipped 11 percent less wine by volume and a
whopping 18 percent less by value in 2008, delivering the first
setback for 15 years, according to government marketing agency
the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, or AWBC. The
average litre value of wine sold dropped 7.6 percent to A$3.53. In key British markets, total value slumped 18 percent,
while in the United States exports fell over a cliff, slumping
26 percent. Rare bright spots included China, which imported 32
percent more Australian wine by value, off a low base, as well
as Hong Kong (up 17 percent) and Japan (up 4.1 percent). SUNSHINE IN A BOTTLE? A few hills distant from Doonkuna, Tim Kirk now sees a
reckoning facing the industry in the wake of what even
optimistic marketers admit has been an extremely disappointing
year. ""We have had massive success with an approach of good wine,
good price, cheap and cheerful, sunshine in a bottle. But in
some respects that's been the seeds of our undoing,"" Kirk says. Kirk's Clonakilla winery sits at the boutique end of
Australia's wine market and his reds, in particular an
award-winning shiraz-viognier, have won international acclaim. But Kirk, a thoughtful second-generation winemaker, says
Australia has been complacent, believing ground-breaking,
cutting-edge production methods developed by the country have
seen New World wine supplant the Old. Quality is there, he says, but the problem -- magnified by
recession gloom -- is a tradition of marketing overseas based
on low price, rather than the critical story of Australia's
wines. ""Rather than compete on good wine, great price, we need to
focus on regionality, on great wine at maybe a good price,""
says Kirk, whose father began Clonakilla in 1971. Since then Western Australia's Margaret River has become
one of the world's great cabernet regions, while South
Australia's Clare Valley turns out world beating Reisling.
Canberra's continental climate rivals Rhone reds, Kirk says. ""The quality is a given, we need to develop the
excitement,"" he says. ""We have ancient soils, every bit capable
of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the great wines of
Europe. Australia needs to grow up."" INCONVENIENT TRUTH Industry heavyweights recognise the problem, which has
gained urgency following the export decline and as last year's
credit crunch spreads shockwaves among major economies, with
Germany, the United States, Japan and the UK in recession. A turbulent run for the Australian dollar, which neared
U.S. dollar parity last year before a dramatic depreciation,
underscores Australia's need for a strategy other than
competing with low-wage rivals in Chile, Argentina and South
Africa. ""We got caught in a tailspin of tactical responses to
apparent opportunities in (the) market which were usually
promotion-driven,"" says Paul Henry, General Manager of Market
Development for the AWBC. Australia exported 62 percent of its wine in 2008 and in
some markets the percentage sold on promotion was above 80
percent as the country looked to repeat 2007's A$3 billion
export high milestone. The average for France is around 40
percent. The industry is by some estimates 20 percent too large with
many newcomers having entered expecting an export bonanza. That has harmed the image of Australia's overall wine
brand, Henry says, making it synonymous with low price in key
markets such as Britain, and some parts of North America. ""The real inconvenient truth for Australia is that we are
not the best placed in the world to compete on volume or price
alone,"" he says. ""There's a stark realization to come to, which is that our
immediate future is going to look very different to our recent
past, in which our ability to produce large volumes of
compellingly branded  easy-drinking wine at a price was
dominant and exclusive."" WHO'S TO BLAME? Greg Corra, who ships the top end of Australia's wine to 32
countries from a small farm outside the capital Canberra, says
many large Australian winemakers have themselves to blame as
they look for ways to cork an export crash. ""Yes, there is a financial crisis. But the ones who are
suffering the most are the larger producers who have allowed
the quality of their products to decline in a bid to meet
demand in the good times,"" Corra told Reuters. Australia's industry is dominated by Foster's, the world's
second largest wine company, with brands including Beringer,
Rosemount and Penfolds. Other major players include U.S.-based
Constellation Brands, which owns the Hardy's label. French-based Pernod Ricard owns the top-selling Jacob's
Creek, while some other major Australian exporters are
family-owned, such as Casella Wines, whose popular Yellow Tail
label has enjoyed phenomenal U.S. success. Around 15 percent of all wine products leaving Australia
are Casella's and 9 percent of Australia's total grape crush in
2007 went through the company's huge plant near Griffith, which
claims the world's fastest bottling line. Corra agrees the future for Australia's industry now lies
in higher quality offerings that still sell despite the
recession. ""I only just entered the UK market as the recession hit and
demand there is amazingly strong. I've just sold 3,000 cases
