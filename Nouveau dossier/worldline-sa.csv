Atos will pay $41 per share, a premium of 4.78 percent to Syntel's closing price of $39.13 on Friday. Including net debt, the transaction is valued at about $3.57 billion.Atos said it expects the deal to provide double digit earnings per share (EPS) growth from 2019, with Syntel bringing the group around $1 billion in revenue and an operating margin of around 24 percent.Analysts at Invest Securities said the price was ""not excessive"", but a Paris-based trader pointed to the funding of the deal as a cause for concern.""They are financing it through debt, which is becoming a source of concern among investors with rising interest rates and a high level of debt among companies,"" he said.Analysts and traders also pointed to the company's first half results as a source of concern.""Atos’ H1 release suggests to us a deteriorating underlying picture, particularly in North America, against hopes that by this time its organic growth trajectory should have been improving,"" said Ameet Patel, Senior Analyst for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets.Atos' payments division Worldline (PA:WLN) on Monday reported half-yearly organic revenue growth of 5.8 percent and announced a deal to process payments for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), sending its shares up over 4 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote
