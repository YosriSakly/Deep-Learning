Valeo  (PA:VLOF) dropped 6.4 percent, the biggest faller on the CAC 40, while Continental (DE:CONG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were among the biggest DAX decliners.Still in the first full trading week of 2019, the STOXX 600 gained 1.7 percent as investors regained their appetite for risk boosted by dovish comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.Equity funds drew inflows of $6.2 billion, the biggest in 11 weeks, BAML said. The FTSE 100 (FTSE) erased earlier gains as sterling bounced amid growing expectations that the government may delay its departure from the European Union beyond March 29. [FRX/]Focus remained on Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get her Brexit deal through parliament, with a crucial vote due on Tuesday. A drastic about-turn in crude prices also weighed on heavyweight oil stocks (SXEP).In the healthcare sector, downgrades by Jefferies hit UDG Healthcare (L:UDG) and Orion Oyj (HE:ORNBV) which were the worst individual performers with falls of 7.7 percent 7.4 percent respectively. French utilities took a hit after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) downgraded ratings on Suez (PA:SEVI) and Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE), citing doubts about the global growth outlook. The stocks were down 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.The UK's housebuilders were stand-out gainers on the day after BAML upgraded its view on the sector, saying ""it seems at least possible, or even probably, that some sort of Brexit resolution is within sight and therefore the UK housebuilding sector may see some relief"". Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and  Persimmon  (L:PSN) were leading British blue chips, both rising more than 4 percent.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

37,"Jul 10, 2018 12:06PM ET",Air France-KLM CEO hunt signals industry strategy shift under Macron,nan,"By Richard LoughPARIS (Reuters) - The hunt for a new chief executive to lead Air France-KLM, a group hobbled by union resistance to cost-cutting at its French brand, is testing President Emmanuel Macron's resolve for a lighter state touch on the economy.Macron's government has told the Franco-Dutch airline group its very survival is at stake if it fails to become more competitive and undergo the painful reforms completed by carriers such as British Airways (L:ICAG) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) as they battle low-cost airlines and Gulf carriers.In what would signal a subtle shift in French industrial strategy, two sources familiar with Macron's thinking said the government is open to considering a non-French national as chairman of the group for the first time. This chairman would sit above one chief executive for Air France, who would almost certainly be a French national, and one for KLM, one of the sources said. It is just one option on the table. Macron's office expects to receive a shortlist of candidates from the group's interim management by the end of next week, a third source familiar with the matter said. The Air France-KLM group (PA:AIRF) has been led by French chief executives since its formation in 2004, a demand of the French state, its largest shareholder and one with heavy influence over the group's board thanks to its outsized voting rights.The last, Jean-Marc Janaillac, resigned in May after losing a fight over pay with Air France staff. His role as group chief executive and chairman as well as chairman of the Air France unit has prompted a rethink of the structure. Paris' readiness to consider a foreigner to oversee a revamp of the airline's strategy and negotiations with Air France unions reflects Macron's desire to create pan-European companies that can withstand globalization, even if that means placing control of a national asset in foreign hands. ""What we want to do is to create European champions,"" a finance ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It's not of primary importance that the boss has to be French.""""It wouldn't worry us if we ended up with an aviation specialist from Europe.""Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115), which both hold 8.8 percent stakes in Air France-KLM, declined to comment.Two names have leaked to media in past weeks. Philippe Capron, the financial head of Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE), pulled out after French ministers said they wanted an aviation specialist and that he was one of several candidates.Le Figaro reported on Monday that Catherine Guillouard, chief executive of French public transport group RATP, was being considered for the top job at Air France-KLM. Two sources told Reuters she was not an official candidate.INVESTOR PRESSUREThe job of Air France-KLM chief executive may not be one that widely appeals. The next company chief will face the unenviable task of having to break union resistance to reduce Air France's swollen cost base, while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch KLM staff onside. A wave of strikes this spring at Air France over pay cost the group some 350 million euros ($410.97 million) and led to the ouster of Janaillac. Sources say KLM officials are frustrated at French staff's chronic labor conflicts and blame Air France's weak handling of the powerful SNPL pilots' union for the group's fragile state.Investors are frustrated too. The group's share price has slumped 47 percent so far this year. Asked recently if the group could have a Dutch chief executive, KLM CEO Pieter Elbers responded: ""why not?""The pressure from investors to slash costs has intensified as rising fuel costs and overcapacity squeeze margins. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned after Janaillac quit that he would not soak up the airline's losses. Overseeing a restructuring of Air France-KLM would cement Macron's reputation as a reformist and modernizer.""Restructuring ... is what is required to move Air France-KLM forward. Anything else will be history repeating itself,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska.STATE EXIT?Macron could go further and sell-down France's 14.3 percent stake in Air France-KLM, a move that would deliver a potent message that he is serious about liberalizing the economy.The state's exit from the airline group would hand its leadership more freedom to stare down the unions.""(IAG chief executive) Willie Walsh just stared them down until blood came out of their eyes and they gave up,"" said aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. AccorHotels (PA:ACCP) announced last month it was looking at buying all or part of the French state's stake - an option the government has not closed the door on but which faces obstacles.""The government is studying things and is closed to nothing, but the first priority is to find a new leadership team for Air France-KLM,"" the finance ministry official said.AccorHotels' overseas investors could, however, complicate any deal. Its main investors are from China and the Gulf, whose own airlines compete with Air France-KLM on long-haul routes. European Union rules also require more than half of a European airline's capital to be held by member states or EU nationals. ""Accor's capital today is not sufficiently European for it to work,"" said a second source familiar with the discussions. There would, however, be ways to overcome this, analysts say. The state's holding remains an open question. Nonetheless, analysts are encouraged by broader comments on the future of Air France-KLM coming out of the French finance ministry. ""The noises heard out of the finance ministry definitely signify a change in attitude toward Air France-KLM from the French state, said Roeska. "" And they fit with Macron’s wider strategy.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

French telecoms company Iliad fell 6 percent even as it reported higher annual sales and profits for 2017, with traders pointing to flat fixed-line revenues in the final quarter.It comes as Orange (PA:ORAN), Iliad rival and dominant French telecoms company, returned to growth last year for the first time since 2009 after spending heavily to roll out high-speed broadband. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 0.2 percent, with utilities a top-performing sector for a second day on plans by German utilities RWE (DE:RWEG) and E.ON (DE:EONGn) to divide up the assets of power utility Innogy (DE:IGY). E.ON (DE:EONGn) got a further boost to the top of the STOXX 600 on Tuesday, its shares gaining 4.4 percent after its results. The company said it would raise its dividends for 2018 and 2019.M&A deals have multiplied in the European market recently, but investors said dealmaking was not at feverpitch.""One thing I am very pleased not to see is the over-arching cross-industry deals which marked the apex of ambition in the early noughties,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.""That sort of reckless expansion and combination seems to be missing from the data, which suggests there is room for further growth,"" he added.Other notable gainers included Swedish debt collector Intrum Justitia (ST:INTRUM) rose 6.2 percent to the top of the STOXX, with traders pointing to a note from SEB upgrading the stock to 'hold' from 'sell'. Traders said the strong price gains on the note were likely down to investors covering short positions on the stock which is down 10 percent so far this year.Oil stocks were also strong boosts.  Total  (PA:TOTF) gained 1.4 percent after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded its rating on it, saying the French oil major is entering a new phase of growth in cashflow and production.Struggling South African retailer Steinhoff (J:SRRJ) saw its Germany-listed shares rise 2.9 percent after it cut its stake in KAP Industrial (J:KAPJ) as it tried to plug a liquidity gap.

The firm said sales would slow due to currency pressures.Veolia (PA:VIE) fell 2.4 percent, the top faller on France's CAC 40, after the Qatari government sold its 4.6 percent stake in the utility group.Overall European company results have been encouraging. Investors said European earnings had further room to grow as they were still lagging the U.S..""The European market isn't pricing in quite as much as the U.S. is, and it's in a more favourable part of the business cycle,"" said Rothschild's Gardiner. ""We are aware that it's a pretty crowded story, but we still think it's very attractive,"" he added.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

57,"Feb 22, 2018 05:41AM ET","Fed points upwards for rates, world stocks lurch downward",nan,"By Sujata RaoLONDON (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled to one-week lows on Thursday after the U.S. Fed confirmed it was on track to raise interest rates several times this year, sending bond yields to new multi-year highs.While U.S. 10-year yields retreated after nearing the psychologically key 3 percent level, the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of January has at least temporarily taken the edge off investors' appetite for equities and other assets perceived as risky, such as emerging markets and commodities.With Fed policymakers agreeing that ""a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate,"" the odds in the market of faster U.S. interest rate hikes have narrowed and a host of Fed fund futures <0#FF:> have hit contract lows. The dollar too was trading just off 10-day highs against a basket of currencies (DXY) and was set for its first week of gains this year.Three rate rises are now almost fully priced in for 2018, compared with two as recently as December, and some traders are even contemplating the possibility of four rate rises in 2018.Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva, said markets seemed to have finally accepted a faster rate rise trajectory for 2018. But she saw no reason for an equity market collapse or sharp bond selloff. ""When I look at the fundamentals, I see stable growth in all major economies, good earnings from the majority of companies and in a historical context, I see low interest rates and low inflation,"" Owens Thomsen said.She was referring to 75 percent of U.S. S&P 500-listed firms which have beaten analysts' forecasts with their fourth-quarter 2017 results, while in Europe the number stands at more than 53 percent according to Thomson Reuters data.Despite all the solid earnings reports, Wall Street saw steep losses on Wednesday after the Fed minutes, and Asian and European markets lost ground too, falling around 1 percent (MIAPJ0000PUS) (N225) (STOXX).The latter failed to even benefit from robust earnings updates from a series of firms ranging from British bank  Barclays  (L:BARC) to French utility Veolia (PA:VIE). MSCI's all-country equity index (MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.4 percent for its third straight day of losses while emerging equities lost 1 percent (MSCIEF).New York was set for another weak session, futures suggested, with S&P futures down around 0.3 percent (ESc1).TRANSATLANTIC SPREAD WIDENINGAnalysts noted that the January Fed meeting had happened after lawmakers approved a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts, potentially adding more fuel to an economy which has already picked up steam.The 3 percent level on 10-year U.S. yields is seen as a huge psychological milestone for bulls and bears alike. In the meantime though the yield, which hit four-year highs around 2.96 percent after the minutes, retreated to 2.92 percent (US10YT=RR). Two-year yields touched new nine-year peaks. That weighed on euro zone yields, with the German 10-year benchmark (DE10YT=RR) down one basis point. Yields were also dampened by data showing German business confidence fell more than expected in February, though Europe's biggest economy is clearly set for solid growth.The next hurdle for markets will be minutes from the European Central Bank's last meeting at 1230 GMT, with investors keen to see if there was more talk of an eventual unwinding of stimulus.The ""transatlantic spread"" between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs widened to near a year high at 220 bps, reflecting the diverging monetary policy expectations between the two countries.Britain however confirmed itself as one of the weak spots in the world economy, with data showing below-forecast 0.4 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. That pushed sterling 0.2 percent lower against the dollar , a one-week low.The firmer dollar pummeled commodities too - Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent  while gold and copper prices also fell  .  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

64,"Dec 21, 2017 10:10AM ET","Ballooning French corporate debt rattles regulators, but not lenders",nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - French corporate debt has ballooned to record levels as other euro zone countries have seen their firms cut debt, unsettling the central bank and prompting a cap on bank lending to the most indebted corporate borrowers.Yet, while the surging debt is stressing regulators, senior bankers, ratings agencies and some economists say it is not so much a case of reckless borrowing as of clever financial engineering in which companies by take advantage of low interest rates to cope with high taxes.France's financial stability council, which includes the finance minister and central bank governor, has taken the unprecedented step of limiting a bank's exposure to highly indebted firms to five percent of its capital. It was essentially a shot across the lenders' bows a bit over-exposure.French corporate borrowing has grown at more than six percent this year, and closer to eight percent for big companies with easy access to the bond market, Bank of France data shows. That compares with forecasted economic growth of 1.8 percent.In fact, 60 percent of the recent increases in euro zone corporate borrowing came from French firms even though France represents only 20 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product, also according to the French central bank.That has left French corporate debt at a record 134 percent of GDP, data from the Bank for International Settlements show. Stripping out intra-group loans, the Bank of France pegs the figure at a more manageable but still record 72 percent.""We consider that there is a risk that big companies in particular are going too far,"" Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said.The central bank is particularly worried that, thanks to cheap credit, some firms are overpaying for acquisitions and could find themselves nursing painful losses should they have to book big writedowns on takeover values in the future.The council says the lending cap, which will take effect in mid-2018, applies to about 10 firms which it is has not identified.Villeroy said it concerned firms with net debt over 100 percent of equity, which could cover companies like Air France KLM (PA:AIRF), Suez (PA:SEVI), Airbus (PA:AIR), EDF (PA:EDF) and  Casino  (PA:CASP), according to Thomson Reuters data.Companies not based in France but with big operations there could also be affected, which could include highly indebted Dutch-registered telecoms group Altice (AS:ATCA).The companies either declined to comment or were not immediately in a position do so when contacted by Reuters.While debt levels are manageable now, a return to historic norms for interest rates could cut profits by more than 20 percent, Natixis chief economist Patrick Artus calculates.""The corporate credit situation in France is very highly dependent on what happens to interest rates,"" Artus told Reuters. ""There's a real problem with corporate debt in France.""RISKS CONTAINEDVilleroy acknowledges there is no imminent danger and the lending cap is for now more bark than bite.""It gives an extremely strong signal that we don't want certain exposures to be increased,"" Villeroy said, adding that it could be tightened if necessary.Economist Marion Amiot of Oxford Economics, meanwhile, says that high levels of debt are not a major cause for concern as the borrowing was put to good use.""Companies have used the money to invest and improve their profitability, even in the face of a high tax burden and rigid labor laws,"" she wrote in a research note.Even though French firms' profit margins are among the weakest in the euro zone, they have maintained above-average investment rates, according to national accounts data.Also, rather than returning cash to shareholders or buy back shares, French firms have retained earnings, keeping balance sheets relatively healthy despite the additional debt.While regulators are uneasy over record debt, investors so far seem content to oblige borrowers.When utility Veolia (PA:VIE) tapped the market for a three-year bond last month, not only did it secure a negative interest rate, but investor bids reached four times the amount offered.Moody's analyst Guillaume Leglise said that credit quality and companies' ratings were on average stable, even though some firms had leveraged up.""Everything is on track, there isn't a short-term liquidity risk, most companies are taking advantage of exceptional market conditions to refinance or to finance acquisitions with debt,"" Leglise said.Indeed, Moody's forecasts French corporate bond issuance to rise next year as the economy picks up. Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) co-head of corporate debt origination Felix Orsini said issuers were being cautious, even if the temptation to take on debt was rising after years of low interest rates.""It's true that after a while management asks, can we take advantage of these financing conditions to make acquisitions or investments, hence the upturn in M&A,"" he said.But he added: ""corporate finance directors, and especially those in France, are among the most cautious people I know.""For a graphic on global corporate debt, click http://reut.rs/2z4LgpdFor a graphic on French corporate debt, click http://reut.rs/2z4qXrJFor a graphic on French profit/investment, click http://reut.rs/2B6NIwZ(Reporting and Graphics by Leigh Thomas; editing by Richard Lough/Jeremy Gaunt)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Frerot, who earlier this year said he would favor organic growth for the business, laid out two conditions for any future large acquisition.""It would need to create new large-size activities for the company and over a long period of at least 10 to 15 years,"" Frerot said in an interview at a business conference in the southeastern city of Aix-en-Provence. ""If we found this, then obviously we'd have the means to do it,"" he said, declining to elaborate on possible targets.Veolia, which also cleans up nuclear facilities and treats low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste, could also benefit from a 50-billion-euro ($57 billion) upgrade of French nuclear sites operated by energy provider EDF (PA:EDF), Frerot said. EDF's upgrade is scheduled for 2014-2025 and aims to extend the life expectancy of its nuclear installations by more than 40 years.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

80,"Jun 13, 2017 01:20AM ET",Japan's aging sewers highlight resistance to Abe's structural reforms,nan,"By Junko FujitaTOKYO (Reuters) - Hidden beneath its streets, Japan's aging sewer pipes spotlight a challenge that has held back reforms Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing to revitalise the world's third-biggest economy.Overhauling the country's infrastructure - roads, tunnels, ports and sewage plants, many of them built after 1970s when the construction boom started - is a looming burden on the government, whose deficit has already swollen to more than twice its GDP.Abe's solution is to sell public assets to companies or allow firms to manage them, which he argues would also help reduce the bulging deficit and generate economic momentum and jobs.Success here would be a boon to stalled structural reforms, which along with monetary and fiscal stimulus, make up his three-pronged approach, or the so-called ""three arrows"", to reenergize long-moribund activity.So far, Japan has sold the right to operate Kansai International Airport, serving Osaka, and Sendai International Airport in northern Japan. Cashing in on a tourism boom, the government is planning to privatise more regional airports.Now authorities aim to open markets for the water systems to private investors. But the plans are not getting much traction. Cities don't trust businesses to take over something as vital as water supplies.Nara, Japan's ancient capital, last year rejected a proposal to let a business operate its water works jointly with the city.“What we are afraid of the most, if the service is privatised, is that the new entity may stop proper water supply in some areas to seek efficiencies,"" said Kentaro Shirakawa, a member of Nara's city assembly.So far, only Hamamatsu, a town in south central Japan, has picked a group of companies led by France's Veolia (PA:VIE) as a winning bidder to operate its sewage system - but not the hard part, overhauling the pipes.The obstacles highlight the difficulties Abe faces in carrying out deeper reforms he says Japan needs to put the economy on a sustainable footing as its population declines.He envisions a 21 trillion yen ($190 billion) market of public-private partnerships (PPPs) by 2022 where businesses operate government-owned assets.So far, that market has reached 9.1 trillion yen, with the Kansai airport accounting for 5 trillion of that.Abe's government is urging cities to privatize their water works as replacement costs rise and their populations decline.Assembly members and local officials in some cities believe that privatizing will lighten the fiscal burden on their own dwindling resources. By 2035, about 28 percent of sewer pipes - or 130,000 kilometers - will reach their 50-year lifespan. Replacement costs for pipes, pumps and other equipment are seen ballooning 66 percent to 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) over 20 years from 2013.Lawmakers in many cities, however, are concerned about whether private companies could provide services in the event of an earthquake, and what would happen if they went bankrupt. Opponents also argue privatization may result in job losses for the contractors that cities rely on now. Cities have little incentive to privatize their water systems because they know they can fall back on the central government to bail them out if they run into a crisis, said Hideaki Tanaka, professor at Meiji University’s graduate school of governance studies. For now, smaller cities and towns are waiting to see if such moves are successful in bigger cities. But most want to keep the status quo - even if they are in the red.In Nara, for instance, the water operations were already running a 200 million yen deficit each year.""They will probably leave the pipelines until they explode,” Tanaka said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America.It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said.The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide ""a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand,"" said Glen De Vos, Delphi's chief technology officer, in a media briefing.Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV (N:MBLY), which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC).Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies' statement said.French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev's chief performance officer. The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing. Initially, the vehicles will have ""safety"" drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added. Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions. Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates).Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries. The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA (PA:VIE), the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake.The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years.In May, German automaker BMW AG (DE:BMWG) announced that Delphi will join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

90,"May 02, 2017 06:27AM ET","France's Le Pen lifts parts of rival's speech, aides brush off plagiarism accusations",nan,"By Ingrid Melander and Sudip Kar-GuptaPARIS (Reuters) - French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen came under fire on social media on Tuesday for lifting sections of a speech from a conservative rival, in what Le Pen aides said was a ""nod-and-a-wink"" to his voters.Although the speech caused an online sensation over plagiarism, it appeared to be an attempt by Le Pen to reach out to supporters of Francois Fillon, who was knocked out in the April 23 first round of voting after coming third with 20 percent of the vote.Polls show Le Pen lagging centrist frontrunner Emmanuel Macron by around 20 points before next Sunday's runoff and she needs to broaden her base to stand a chance of winning. Fillon has urged voters to back Macron.In one part of her May 1 speech, lasting about 50 seconds, Le Pen talked about people learning French in Argentina and Poland, and on waiting lists to study at the Alliance Francaise official French schools abroad, in a word-per-word lifting of a mid-April speech by Fillon.Le Pen added to Fillon's comment that this showed France is more than a military and industrial power, that France ""must and can"" become a big power again.It was the second most trending topic on Twitter in France, with the hashtag #plagiat -- plagiarism in French.One Twitter user, @RidiculeTV, posted both excerpts together on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RidiculeTV/status/859099588002811908 The incident had echoes of an incident during last year U.S. election when a writer for then-candidate Donald Trump's campaign apologized for a speech by Trump's wife Melania that drew accusations of plagiarism.UNREPENTANTThe National Front (FN) candidate's team was unrepentant, however. Florian Philippot, an FN deputy leader, said the party ""completely owned up"" to the fact that the speech resembled one by Fillon. Le Pen also described France's borders and ties with ""Italy, our sister"" - again a phrase used in Fillon's April 15 speech, and used the same quote from early 20th century French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau.In another excerpt about prospects of cooperation with France's neighbors, where the words were again the same as in Fillon's speech, Le Pen added that this would require France not being ""a vassal"" of Germany. French newspapers and social media highlighted the similarities, but Le Pen aides brushed off the criticism. Philippot told Radio Classique that Le Pen's speech was a ""nod-and-a-wink"" to Fillon's speech in order to ""launch a real debate"" about French identity. Le Pen's campaign manager David Rachline also played down plagiarism accusations, painting her speech as a form of tribute to Fillon. The reference ""was appreciated, including by all of Mr. Fillon's supporters,"" Rachline told France 2 television.There was no immediate comment from Fillon.Separately, several French business leaders, writing in French business daily Les Echos, warned against what Veolia (PA:VIE) chief Antoine Frerot called the ""catastrophe for French businesses and people"" of Le Pen's favored scrapping of the euro currency and other parts of the FN manifesto.The latest Ipsos Sopra Steria poll on Tuesday showed Macron winning 60 percent of second-round votes to Le Pen's 40 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

124,"Jul 28, 2016 06:40PM ET",Michigan prosecutor to bring new criminal charges in Flint water scandal,nan,"DETROIT (Reuters) - The Michigan Attorney General's Office said on Thursday it will bring a second round of criminal charges related to the investigation into dangerous lead levels in the city of Flint's drinking water.Attorney General Bill Schuette's office said in a brief media advisory the charges would be announced on Friday morning. Office spokeswoman Andrea Bitely said she could provide no further information on the upcoming announcement, including specific charges and the identities of those being charged.Flint, with a population of about 100,000, was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 when it switched its water source from Detroit's municipal system to the Flint River to save money. The city switched back in October 2015.The river water was more corrosive than the Detroit system's and caused more lead to leach from its aging pipes. Lead can be toxic, and children are especially vulnerable. The crisis has prompted lawsuits by parents who say their children have shown dangerously high levels of lead in their blood.Three state and local officials were criminally charged in April in connection with the investigation. Flint utilities administrator Michael Glasgow subsequently agreed to cooperate with investigators as part of a deal that had him plead no contest to a misdemeanor charge while a more serious felony charge was dismissed.Michigan Department of Environmental Quality officials Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby were charged with five and six counts, respectively, including misconduct in office, tampering with evidence and violation of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act. Both pleaded not guilty.Additionally, Schuette last month sued French water company Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE) SA and Houston-based engineering services firm Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam for ""botching"" their roles in the city's drinking water crisis.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

127,"Jun 22, 2016 01:11PM ET",Michigan attorney general sues France's Veolia in Flint water crisis,nan,"By Ben KlaymanDETROIT (Reuters) - The Michigan attorney general on Wednesday sued French water company Veolia and a Texas firm for ""botching"" their roles in the city of Flint's drinking water crisis that exposed residents to dangerously high lead levels.Attorney General Bill Schuette said at a news conference in Flint that the civil lawsuit was filed in Genesee County Circuit Court against Veolia Environnement SA (PA:VIE) and Houston-based engineering services firm Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam (LAN). The lawsuit charged Veolia with professional negligence and fraud that caused Flint's the lead poisoning to continue and worsen, and LAN with professional negligence.Schuette said the state is seeking damages from the companies that could total hundreds of millions of dollars. His office said additional claims against the firms or others may be filed in the future.“Many things went tragically wrong in Flint, and both criminal conduct and civil conduct caused harm to the families of Flint and to the taxpayers of Michigan,” Schuette said. “In Flint, Veolia and LAN were hired to do a job and failed miserably, basically botched it. They didn't stop the water in Flint from being poisoned. They made it worse.”Veolia was hired in February 2015 by the city to address drinking water quality and produced at least one report and one public presentation stating the city's water was safe to drink, according to the lawsuit. The company knew its representations were false, the lawsuit stated.Paris-based Veolia said Schuette's office did not contact the company about its work and that its contract was unrelated to the current lead problem.It said it will defend itself against ""these unwarranted allegations of wrongdoing."" Veolia shares dipped 0.2 percent.In 2013, LAN worked with Flint to prepare the city's water plant to treat new sources of drinking water, including the Flint River, according to the lawsuit.LAN did not issue corrosion control measures in April 2014 and in August 2015 produced a report saying the water met federal safety requirements, failing to recognize the lead problem, according to the lawsuit.In a statement, LAN said it ""was not hired to operate the water plant and had no responsibility for water quality."" It will ""vigorously defend itself against these unfounded claims,"" it said. Flint, with a population of about 100,000, was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 when it switched its water source from Detroit's municipal system to the Flint River to save money. The city switched back in October.The river water was more corrosive than the Detroit system's and caused more lead to leach from its aging pipes. Lead can be toxic, and children are especially vulnerable. The crisis has prompted lawsuits by parents who say their children have shown dangerously high levels of lead in their blood.Last month, a Flint utilities administrator agreed to cooperate in investigations as part of a deal with prosecutors. Two state employees have been charged by Schuette's office, and he reaffirmed Wednesday that other employees would be charged as the investigation continues.Todd Flood, who is leading the state probe, said on Wednesday he has not received all documents that have been requested, including those from Governor Rick Snyder's office. Some people have criticized the governor and called on him to resign for the state's poor handling of the crisis.When asked if Snyder was a target in the investigation, Schuette said there are no targets but ""nobody is off the table.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

136,"Feb 09, 2016 01:13PM ET","Ten dead, more than 80 injured in Bavaria train crash",nan,"By Joern PoeltzBAD AIBLING, Germany (Reuters) - Ten people were killed and at least 81 injured on Tuesday when two passenger trains collided head-on at high speed in remote countryside in southern Germany.One passenger was still missing, police said, and 18 of those injured were in a serious condition.The crash happened during the morning rush-hour about half way along a six-km (four-mile) stretch between the spa town of Bad Aibling and Kolbermoor in Bavaria, near to the border with Austria.Ambulances could not reach the site, which was heavily wooded with a steep hill on one side and a river on the other, so helicopters had to airlift people to nearby hospitals.Police said recovery operations with heavy machinery would be suspended overnight and restart at daybreak on Wednesday.The trains had been carrying about 100 passengers, mainly commuters. Police said more people would have been traveling if it had not been a holiday week.Hundreds of emergency service workers, including mountain rescue teams, worked to save passengers at the crash site, where several derailed blue, yellow and grey train carriages lay on their side next to the track. Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the trains and track had been fitted with an automatic brake system that was introduced across Germany after 10 people died in 2011 near Magdeburg when a train driver drove through two red signals. ""It's one of the biggest accidents we have had in the last few years,"" he said.Germany's most serious post-war train accident occurred in 1998 when 101 people were killed near the northern town of Eschede after a high speed ICE train crashed.Dobrindt said both trains on Tuesday must have been traveling at high speed entering a curve and the drivers had probably not seen each other. Police declined to comment on the cause of the crash. They appealed for people to donate blood.Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed shock and sent her condolences to families of the victims.""I trust that the authorities responsible will do everything they can to clear up how this accident could happen,"" she said in a statement.Dobrindt said an investigation had begun and that the priority was to find out whether the cause was a technical problem or human error. The trains' operator, Meridian, is part of French passenger transport firm Transdev, which is jointly owned by state-owned bank CDC and water and waste firm Veolia (PA:VIE).Transdev said in a statement that management and staff were terribly shocked by the ""exceptionally serious accident"" and that Chief Executive Jean-Marc Janaillac was at the scene.State-owned Deutsche Bahn is responsible for the track, which has a speed limit of 100 km per hour. The company said the safety system had been checked last week.(For graphic of bad Aibking rail crash site: http://reut.rs/1T4aQkn  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The government has already instructed a mediator to facilitate negotiations between the unions and management.""The company is in danger of death,"" Valls warned, saying it could still survive if its workers were ready to negotiate and to take up certain challenges, notably concerning routes to and from North Africa. He did not elaborate.Owned 66 percent by Transdev - a public transport joint venture between water and waste group Veolia Environnement (PA:VIE) and state-bank CDC - the ferry operator has racked up cumulative losses of 250 million euros over the past decade despite subsidies it receives from French authorities.Some legal experts say a Chapter 11-style restructuring would allow a new owner to buy some of SNCM's ships and continue some of its current routes under a new legal structure and with part of the company's staff.SNCM's restructuring is crucial for Veolia as the current stalemate blocks a plan to sell most of its stake in Transdev - a tram, train and bus operator with turnover of 7 billion euros and 90,000 staff in more than 20 countries - to CDC.($1 = 0.7331 Euros)(Reporting by Natalie Huet; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)"
