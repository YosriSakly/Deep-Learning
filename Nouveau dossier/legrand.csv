30,"Feb 03, 2017 06:00AM ET",Rising costs lurk behind brighter European corporate results,nan,"By Kit ReesLONDON (Reuters) - The rising cost of raw materials is likely to be risk for European firms, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said, adding that the impact of inflation and companies' pricing power were key themes emerging from the ongoing results season.Rising commodity prices have fueled increased inflation expectations in Europe, and sparked the so-called ""reflation"" trade since last summer as investors rushed into shares of banks, industrials and resources firms.However, higher prices for raw materials compounded by weaker currencies like sterling mean that for those companies unable to pass on costs to customers, profit margins are likely to come under pressure.Overall, fourth quarter earnings in Europe are expected to rise 12.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data while sales are seen rising only 1.7 percent, underscoring the investor focus on profit margins.European industrials and consumer-facing companies could be among those most affected, Goldman Sachs said, and those with already low margins were most vulnerable.""On recent earnings calls, several companies have highlighted that raw materials are expected to move from a being tailwind in 2016 to a headwind in 2017,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note to clients.The U.S. investment bank pointed to recent comments from Electrolux (ST:ELUXb), Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), among others, highlighting rising costs of everything from chemicals, plastics to palm oil.In this environment, Goldman Sachs recommends investors seek out companies that have a history of pricing power.  Assa Abloy  (ST:ASSAb),  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and  Legrand  (PA:LEGD) in the industrial goods sector have shown stable historical margins, suggesting they are among those companies able to withstand cost pressures, Goldman said.There was limited evidence that wage pressures were building up at European firms, though Goldman warned that this could be risk for those companies exposed to the U.S. and the UK.Bakery firm Aryzta (S:ARYN) plunged last month after a profit warning blamed partly on rising costs.Wage increases in the U.S. could hit firms such as  Wolseley  (L:WOS), Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD),  Bunzl  (L:BNZL) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), whose U.S. sales exposure is between 58-66 percent according to Goldman figures.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

35,"Oct 04, 2016 05:08AM ET",ABB rejects shareholder calls to spin off Power Grids,nan,"By John RevillZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss engineering group ABB (S:ABBN) is to keep its Power Grids business in a rejection of demands from an activist investor to spin it off and is to start a $3 billion share buy back from next year.The Zurich-based company's long-awaited decision disappointed Cevian Capital, ABB's second biggest shareholder, which had wanted Power Grids to become a separate entity. Investor AB, ABB's largest shareholder, backed the decision to hold on to Power Grids.ABB said on Tuesday it had made this choice to take advantage of trends like smart grids and linking renewable energy production to consumers and that this was a better option than selling, floating, or spinning off the business.Cevian Capital, ABB's second-biggest shareholder with a 6.2 percent stake, said it was disappointed.""ABB is a collection of top-quality businesses whose performance has been hindered for many years by the company's conglomerate structure,"" Christer Gardell, Cevian's Managing Partner & co-founder, said.Cevian said that separating ABB and Power Grids, which makes parts for offshore wind turbines, could create two companies with combined share price of 35 Swiss francs ($35.80).""The board has decided to keep the conglomerate structure. We think this is an unfortunate decision. The board and management team will be held accountable for realizing 35 francs,"" Gardell said.ABB's share price, which despite a recovery in 2016, has lagged rivals like  General Electric  (N:GE),  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and  Legrand  (PA:LEGD) over the past five years.ABB's shares were up about 1.5 percent at 22.31 Swiss francs at 0857 GMT.ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said he had had a ""friendly and open"" conversation with Cevian early on Tuesday, without giving further details.""Cevian and ABB have a lot in common,"" he told reporters. ""We will drive a lot of value creation for our shareholders.""Chief Financial Officer Erik Elzvik said it would be possible for ABB to increase its share price to 35 Swiss francs, but did not give a time frame.Power Grids is the least profitable of ABB's divisions due partly to its involvement low margin projects. Competition has also forced down prices of products like transformers, also hitting margins.Profitability has improved this year as a result of linking with partners to share the risk on projects and a greater focus on product supply rather than engineering, procurement and construction management services.ABB said it was raising its margin outlook for Power Grids to a range of 10 to 14 percent from 2018, from a previous target of 8 to 12 percent. This would be achieved by focusing on higher-margin consultancy services and software.Spiesshofer said he saw potential because the power grids market was growing at around 3 percent per year, but some parts were growing much faster. Investor AB CEO Johan Forssell said: ""We see no reason to jeopardize the strong momentum, for example when it comes to cost savings and the turnaround of the systems part of Power Grids, the company enjoys by breaking it up.""""Secondly, we believe that ABB is more worth kept together than divided into pieces. We simply believe that the separation costs outweigh the positive aspects of a breakup, and we believe that ABB is a good owner of the business.""ABB, which announced its plans at an investor day on Tuesday, said the share buy back program would run from 2017-2019.($1 = 0.9776 Swiss francs)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

  * Rejects previous verdict on compensation for sale price
  * Schneider shares up 1.8 pct, reversing early losses  
 (Adds details, share price) LUXEMBOURG, July 16 (Reuters) - Schneider Electric is
eligible for some compensation from the European Commission for
wrongly blocking the French engineering group's merger with
Legrand, the EU's top court said on Thursday. ""The court upholds ... the judgment of the Court of First
Instance in so far as it ordered the community to make good the
loss represented by the expenses incurred by Schneider in
respect of its participation in the merger control procedure,""
the Court of Justice said in a statement. But it dismissed part of the CFI's verdict which had ordered
the European Union executive to indemnify Schneider for the loss
the company said it incurred when it sold Legrand at a lower
price. The Commission, which regulates mergers in the 27-nation EU,
prohibited Schneider's 6.42 billion euro ($9 billion) takeover
of Legrand in October 2001 on concerns the acquisition would
reduce competition, particularly in France. It ordered Schneider to divest Legrand by February 2003.
Schneider then took its case to the European Union's Court of
First Instance, seeking compensation of about 1.7 billion euros
for losses it said it had sustained. The botched takeover cost Schneider some 2 billion euros
although it benefited from a 500 million euro tax credit. Schneider shares were up 1.8 percent at 57.60 euros by 1358
GMT, reversing early losses before the court verdict and
outperforming a 1.6 percent rise in France's CAC-40.
 The Court of First Instance ruled in July 2007 that the EU
executive was liable to be sued by Schneider for harm caused by
its veto.

midday on Tuesday, led by energy companies as crude prices rose
to $69 a barrel, and technology firms gaining from Texas
Instruments' upbeat outlook. At 1045 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.3 percent at 867.46 points, down from a high of
875.75 after gloomy German macroeconomic data.  The index fell 0.8 percent on Monday, but is up more than 34
percent from the lifetime low it hit on March 9.
 German industrial production fell unexpectedly by 1.9
percent month-on-month in April, hit by a sharp fall in capital
goods output, the Economy Ministry said. German exports resumed their slide in April and imports fell
even more sharply, tempering hopes that Europe's largest economy
will soon recover from its deepest recession since World War
Two. ""The market is taking a bit of a breather,"" said Georgina
Taylor, equity strategist, Legal & General Investment Management
in London. ""The data has been mixed, with German industrial
production worse than expected. ""We're past that stage of all news being good news. We need
to sit back and reassess how strong the recovery is going to be,
how quick it is going to be."" Oil was hovering around $69 a barrel, just below its highest
in seven months, as the dollar retreated and ahead of weekly
stocks data forecast to show a fall in U.S. crude inventories. BP gained 1.5 percent, while ENI, Royal Dutch Shell and
Total rose between 0.7 and 1.1
percent. Tech stocks got a boost from U.S. firm Texas Instruments,
which raised its targets for second-quarter earnings and
revenue, signalling improving demand in the chip market. Index heavyweight Nokia climbed 3.9 percent, while
STMicroelectronics and Alcatel-Lucent added 3.7 and 1.7 percent,
respectively. We expect other companies to also beat their initial
guidance when they report their second-quarter revenues in
July,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.  U.S. FUTURES FALL Wall Street was set for a lower open. Futures for the Dow
Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were flat to down 0.3 percent.
 ""The Spring rally has produced a big gap in valuations
between cyclicals and defensives. But the market is now heading
into a consolidation phase, and we should see a rotation in

trade on Tuesday, erasing all of the previous session's losses,
as buoyant commodity prices boosted heavyweight energy shares
such as Total and BP. Tech stocks got a boost from U.S. firm Texas Instruments,
which raised its targets for second-quarter earnings and
revenue, signalling improving demand in the chip market. STMicroelectronics gained 5.2 percent, Infineon rose 2.7
percent, Nokia climbed 4 percent, and Alcatel-Lucent added 2.3
percent.
 ""We expect other companies to also beat their initial
guidance when they report their second-quarter revenues in
July,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note. At 0835 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was up 0.6 percent at 870.60 points. The benchmark index has surged 35 percent since falling to a
record low in early March, a sharp rebound spurred by signs of
economic recovery, but the rally has lost steam over the past
three weeks. ""The Spring rally has produced a big gap in valuations
between cyclicals and defensives. But the market is now heading
into a consolidation phase, and we should see a rotation in
favour of utilities, healthcare and the likes,"" said Jacques
Henry, analyst at Louis Capital Markets, in Paris. So far this year, the DJ Stoxx basic resources index, home
of Europe's mining and steel stocks, has gained 51 percent, the
banking index has risen 22 percent, and the energy index added
17 percent. On the downside, the utilities index has lost 9.4
percent, and the healthcare index is down 6.6 percent. Around Europe on Tuesday, UK's FTSE 100 index was up 0.4
percent, Germany's DAX index up 0.6 percent, and France's CAC 40
 up 0.7 percent. Oil rose above $69 a barrel, ending two days of falls, as
the U.S. dollar retreated and ahead of weekly stocks data
forecast to show a fall in U.S. crude inventories. Total added 1.1 percent, BP gained 1.7 percent and Repsol
climbed 1.6 percent. Mining and steel shares were also on the upside, rising
along with metal prices. Rio Tinto added 0.9 percent and
ArcelorMittal up 2.8 percent. French electrical components firm Legrand gained 5 percent
after UBS upgraded its rating on the stock to ""buy"" from
""neutral"", while food group Danone, upgraded to ""overweight""
from ""equal weight"" by Morgan Stanley, rose 3.5 percent. Banking shares were on the rise, led by Lloyds Banking Group
Plc, up 4.1 percent. British media reported the lender would
close all branches of its Cheltenham & Gloucester mortgage unit
and cut some 1,500 jobs. Spain's Banco Santander was up 1.3 percent, France's Societe
Generale was up 1.9 percent, and Credit Suisse rose 0.6 percent. On the downside, Air France-KLM tumbled 3.8 percent after
Europe's biggest airline unveiled an 8.1 percent drop in
passenger traffic in May, and after RBS cut its rating on the
stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"".
