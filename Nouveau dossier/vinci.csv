8,"Jan 08, 2019 01:28PM ET",French motorway operator Sanef tries to cushion toll hike,nan,"By Dominique Vidalon and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - French motorway operator Sanef said on Tuesday it was working on proposals to cushion the impact on drivers of a planned hike in toll charges, following a government request as nationwide protests over high living costs continue. From Feb. 1, French highway toll prices are expected to rise by 1.8 percent on average, after increasing by 1.55 percent in 2018. But with anti-government “yellow vests” protests showing no signs of abating in France, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne urged motorway operators last week to avoid sending a negative signal to drivers.Companies such as Sanef, owned by Spain's Abertis,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and  Eiffage  (PA:FOUG) that run the French highways pay for road upgrades with tariff hikes, which are reviewed once a year and agreed with the government.""Tariff hikes in February should not be challenged but the government is asking for solutions to cushion the impact on frequent users,"" a Sanef spokeswoman said during a press lunch.""In order to participate in the global effort on purchasing power... We will for instance offer new home-to-work subscription formulas,"" she said.Motorway operators were given 10 days to come up with proposals and are expected to meet with the Transport Minister next week.The ""yellow vests"" - named after the fluorescent jackets French motorists must have in their cars - have blocked roads and roundabouts across France since mid-November, sometimes occupying highway tolls and setting a number on fire.The demonstrations began as a protest against fuel tax increases, but have morphed into a wider backlash against the liberal economic policies of French President Emmanuel Macron.Sanef has yet to estimate the damages it had incurred but larger operator Vinci has said destruction since the start of the protests will cost it ""several tens of millions"" of euros, not including lost revenue, as the protesters have allowed thousands of motorists onto the highways for free.Vinci, however, dropped a plan to send invoices to motorists who drove through toll booths without paying and whose license plates were captured on cameras, following government criticism.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

9,"Dec 27, 2018 09:35AM ET",France's Vinci in $3.7 billion swoop on UK's Gatwick airport,nan,"By Gilles Guillaume and Zuzanna SzymanskaPARIS (Reuters) - France's  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) is taking advantage of a Brexit hit to UK asset prices to buy a majority stake in Britain's second-busiest airport, London's Gatwick, for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion), the construction company said on Thursday. The deal to buy a 50.01 percent stake gives Vinci, which already runs 45 airports in 12 countries, access to the world's largest metropolitan aviation market and is part of the company's drive to expand its most promising businesses.Vinci Airports President Nicolas Notebaert signalled uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union next March had cut the price of buying into Gatwick, and forecast any hit to UK economic growth after Brexit was likely to be offset by a rise in tourism due to a weaker pound. ""Just a few months ago we would not even have dreamed of being able to acquire an unlimited licence in the London airports system for less than 20 times core earnings,"" he said on a conference call, referring to the price of the deal. The acquisition is expected to close by June 2019. It comes just days after drone sightings caused 36 hours of chaos for more than 100,000 travellers at Gatwick. CEO Stewart Wingate, who will remain in his role, said the airport was working to avoid a repeat of the disruption. Thirty miles (48 km) south of London, Gatwick serves 228 destinations in 74 countries and is a major base for airlines including EasyJet (L:EZJ) and British Airways (L:ICAG). It handles over 46 million passengers per year, more than a quarter of the 170 million passenger journeys the London airports system - led by Heathrow - handled in 2017.Vinci says Gatwick is the most efficient airport in the world and operates the busiest single runway, which in 2017 achieved a record 950 flights in one day. Gatwick plans to serve growing demand by optimising its existing runway and boosting use of its standby one. FRENCH AIRPORTS GIANTVinci is buying Gatwick shares from existing shareholders.Investment group Global Infrastructure Partners will halve its stake to 21 percent, while Abu Dhabi Investment Authority will own 7.9 percent, California Public Employees' Retirement System 6.4 percent, National Pension Service of Korea 6 percent and Australia's Future Fund Board of Guardians 8.6 percent.The deal follows Vinci's purchase this year of the airport management portfolio of Airports Worldwide, which allowed it to enter the United States and expand in Europe.Notebaert said the deal would ""not in the least"" affect Vinci's interest in Paris airports operator ADP (PA:ADP), which the government plans to privatise.""For ADP, all depends on the terms the government will set in coming months. We have the financial and operational capacity,"" he said. Vinci operates airports in countries including France, Portugal, Britain, Sweden, Serbia, Cambodia, Japan, United States, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Chile and Brazil. In 2017, its network handled over 180 million passengers. To counter signs of weakness in its construction business, the company has been expanding into faster growing and more profitable concessions such as airports and motorways.In 2017, Vinci Airports' managed activities revenue was 3.2 billion euros, with consolidated revenue at 1.4 billion euros. Between 2014 and 2017, Vinci Airports' revenue grew 196 percent, driving the concessions business up 19.3 percent. Vinci Construction's revenue fell 9.5 percent over the same period.At 1403 GMT, Vinci shares were little changed at 70.5 euros.($1 = 0.7903 pounds)(Reporting Gilles Guillaume in Paris and by Zuzanna Szymanska in Gdynia Writing by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

27,"Apr 27, 2018 08:04AM ET","From Disney to Dior, Norway wealth fund challenges CEO pay",nan,"By Gwladys FoucheOSLO (Reuters) - Executive pay is firmly in the crosshairs of Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund as it puts its votes to work at some of the more than 9,000 companies it is invested in.The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, built on Norway's oil revenues, has become a more active shareholder in recent years and since 2017 has called for changes including the scrapping of long-term incentive plans and simpler and more transparent packages.So far in this year's annual general meeting season, data shows the fund voted against a stock option plan for Tesla (O:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, which would potentially be worth $2.6 billion to the electric carmaker's founder.. It has also voted against the pay of  Disney  (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger,  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) CEO Sydney Toledano,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) CEO Carlos Tavares,  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) CEO Xavier Huilliard and  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine.The fund's chief executive Yngve Slyngstad said that transparency remains a sticking point on pay.""It is the transparency and that is quite often linked to the simplicity,"" Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of an earnings presentation on Friday.""If you get to a situation where we have a possibility to voice our opinion on pay, it has to be reasonably well defined in advance -- what kind of pay package it will lead to.""The main way to influence was to determine the pay of incoming CEOs, rather than existing ones since their compensation has already been agreed, he said, adding that change could take five to 10 years.He declined to speak about individual companies except for engineering firm The  Weir Group  (L:WEIR), which the fund praised this month for being willing to ""challenge conventional thinking on remuneration"" by being simple and transparent.""The Weir Group has led by example to a different degree than others and were very clear in the way they were doing it. We wanted to highlight them,"" said Slyngstad. ""We have not outlined any other companies that we would want to do the same for in advance. We are watching."" The fund is also against CEOs doubling up as chairmen and has voted against the elections of Bank of America (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, L'Oreal (PA:OREP) CEO Jean-Paul Agon and Walt Disney (N:DIS) CEO Bob Iger on their respective boards.It is also against board members being elected as a group as it cannot then have a say on individual members. This season it therefore voted against the reelections of the boards of both Sweden's  Alfa Laval  (ST:ALFA) and Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa).NEGATIVE RETURNThe fund posted its first loss in two years in the first quarter, primarily due to falling stock markets, and Slyngstad told an earnings presentation that rising protectionism could impact the fund's equity investments as the top 100 world multinationals account for 20 percent of its equity portfolio.""Any changes to the global supply chain, or tariffs that will hit the global supply chain, will of course be quite important for this fund ... Any action that reduces world growth will usually affect earnings and will affect pricing of the companies we are invested in,"" Slyngstad told reporters. Some 66.2 percent of the fund's assets were held in stocks at the end of the first quarter, 31.2 percent in fixed income and 2.6 percent in real estate. The fund's return was minus 1.5 percent in the quarter, slightly better than its own benchmark but lagging the positive return of 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 2017.The most negative contributions were Nestle (S:NESN), Facebook (O:FB) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC). Nestle was the fund's third-largest equity holding at the end of the quarter, worth 46 billion crowns, fund data showed. Investments in Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Netflix (O:NFLX) made the most positive contribution.The Norwegian government withdrew 11 billion crowns during the first quarter to pay for public expenses, compared with 61 billion crowns for the whole of 2017.

In the first case, the government is claiming damages from Toll Collect and its consortium for the late introduction of the truck toll and for contractual penalties.In the second case, Toll Collect is seeking compensation from the government for operation of the toll system.The Handelsblatt report said that Berlin is still in negotiations with the shareholders in an effort to resolve the disputes and ensure that potential liabilities arising from the cases do not hinder a sale.The ministry spokesman declined to comment further on the matter.Daimler and Deutsche Telekom on Tuesday both declined to comment on the report."

41,"Sep 14, 2017 07:37AM ET",Don't fear the euro: investors stick with European stocks,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - The surging euro has played spoilsport with what had become global investors' top trade this year -- buying European equities - though for some recent weakness in stocks offers a chance to reshuffle portfolios and stay invested. Fund managers, betting on diminishing political risk and confidence that the region was leaving behind years of economic sluggishness and flat-lining corporate profits, pumped money in the first five months of this year into cheaply valued stocks, particularly those that stood to benefit from a global recovery.However, major stock indexes peaked at two-year highs in May and have suffered sell-offs through the summer as the euro kept rising, fuelling worries that profits at the region's large exporters would suffer as their competitiveness takes a hit.In August European equity funds even suffered their first weekly outflows in many months, as the euro strengthened to levels that caught many by surprise.But some of the world's top funds say the falls are overdone and the euro's strength underscores the region's better prospects, so that shares of domestically focused companies could offer rich rewards.""I used to own a lot of exporters but that's changed,"" said Fidelity's Bill Kennedy, who has been managing the $10 billion Fidelity International Discovery Fund since 2004.Kennedy has already made his bets by adding to his portfolio more banks, builders and materials firms that he reckons will take advantage of a domestic recovery in the region.""The strengthening euro is a sign of improved confidence... The reality is that interest rates are going up because people are more confident and that's a good thing,"" he said.Strength in the euro not only helps many firms reduce costs of imported goods but historically it has lifted returns for offshore investors, such as Kennedy.Stocks ranging from builder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) in France to German real estate firm Vonovia (DE:VNAn) and Italian retail bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) are among the top picks for analysts and investors. They make more than 80 percent of their sales in Europe, which is witnessing a string of upgrades to economic forecasts as domestic demand bolsters the recovery. The European Central Bank has lifted its 2017 euro zone GDP growth estimate to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent previously.Yet the sudden spikes in the euro have clearly shown their market-moving potential this summer when the scale of overweight Europe rose close to the highest levels ever.Data from EPFR Global showed redemptions from European stock funds hit six-month highs in the last week of August when the euro peaked above $1.20 for the first time in two and a half years. Exchange-traded funds tracking the euro zone blue chip index (STOXX50E) were among the hardest hit as two-thirds of all Europe Equity Funds recorded outflows or no flows, EPFR said. Graphic for Euro story: http://reut.rs/2jqBYkKVALUATION GAP Opportunities abound under the surface.""Despite euro strength and upgrades to GDP forecasts, domestically focused euro area stocks have so far not materially outperformed,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists led by Dennis Jose said.Like Fidelity, the British investment house believes that banks and materials are the sectors to bet on and, if the past is any guide, a strong currency is a good omen.Historically, a strengthening euro has been a crucial component for European outperformance, Barclays wrote.Following the initial euro-related stress, European stocks showed signs this month they can weather the swings, raising the prospect that the focus could soon turn to company fundamentals. When ECB President Mario Draghi last week outlined concerns about currency volatility, the euro spiked higher again but European equities largely shrugged off the move. ""I believe the correlation (euro up/European stocks down) is largely emotional and it is bound to vanish,"" said Alessandro Balsotti, head of asset management at JCI Capital.One key ingredient that makes the case for investing in Europe is that valuations have become attractive again. On a price/earnings metric, the broader euro zone index (STOXXE) has never been as cheap vis-à-vis Wall Street since 2009.UBS strategists led by Nick Nelson believe the discount of stocks with large euro zone exposure is even more appealing, while noting that a strong currency in the past has sometimes coincided with decent European earnings growth.Among their favorite plays they mentioned Dutch bank ING (AS:INGA), French caterer  Elior  (PA:ELIOR) as well as Vinci and Renault, which all combine high eurozone exposure with appealing valuations and strong earnings prospects. ""Going forward, the quality of Europe Inc's earnings will be more important than the euro,"" JCI Capital's Balsotti said.Graphic for Euro zone valuation gap widens: http://reut.rs/2jlTRRB  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

44,"Aug 04, 2017 12:49PM ET","Lottery, Paris airport could kick off French privatizations within weeks: sources",nan,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic, Matthieu Protard and Gilles GuillaumePARIS (Reuters) - The national lottery, Paris's main airport operator and several other firms deemed not strategic could kick off a wave of French privatizations this autumn, banking sources with knowledge of the plans said. The French finance ministry last month announced plans to sell 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion) worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.Banking sources told Reuters the first privatizations are likely to be launched between the end of this month and early October but will not include the defense, aerospace and nuclear industries. This would exclude companies like  Thales  (PA:TCFP),  Safran  (PA:SAF), Airbus (PA:AIR) and EDF (PA:EDF).French national lottery company Française des Jeux (FDJ) is likely to be high on the list for a partial privatization.It is 72 percent state owned and investment banks have proposed several scenarios, including selling a stake to a content operator or another European lottery company. With 26 million players and turnover of 14.3 billion euros last year, FDJ is Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica. FDJ declined to comment.""Investment banks have pitched a lot of proposals, but nothing has been decided,"" one of the sources said. Sources say the government could also reduce its 23.05 percent stake in telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) relatively quickly.The state's 50.63 percent stake in airport operator ADP (PA:ADP), which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, is also expected to be on the block, and several potential buyers - including ADP minority shareholder  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) - have already publicly expressed an interest.Publicly owned financial institution la Caisse des Dépôts, which is relatively independent from the French government, expressed an interest in ADP last month and has already worked in tandem with Vinci on the Lyon airport. Before it can sell down its stake in ADP further, the government would have to push through a legal change allowing it to let the state's share in ADP fall below 50 percent. It will have to do the same for gas utility Engie, (PA:ENGIE) in which it is required to hold one third under current legislation that dates back to the company's privatization. A government source said that STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will not be on the sales list as micro chips are considered a strategic industry while a pact with the Italian state, which is a co-shareholder, also would complicate a deal. For now state holding company APE has not launched any formal sales procedures or mandated any investment banks, banking sources say. Besides outright sales, the state could try more original approaches, like for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). Late last month the government agreed to let Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and China Eastern (SS:600115) take minority stakes in the carrier, which means the state's share will be diluted to 14 from 17.6 percent.

50,"May 05, 2017 11:00AM ET",Bouygues deal to build Tehran airport terminal canceled,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - A preliminary deal signed by  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) last year to build and run a new terminal at Tehran's Khomeini airport has been canceled, a spokesman for the French construction group said on Friday. The memorandum of understanding awarding Bouygues the contract was agreed in January 2016.The project was hindered by the company's struggle to get financial backing from international banks, which are still wary of U.S. sanctions over their activities in Iran, online newspaper La Lettre de l'Expansion earlier reported. ""The MoU is now void but there are still ongoing discussions with Iranian authorities,"" the Bouygues spokesman said. Aeroports de Paris (PA:ADP), initially Bouygues' partner for the Tehran airport terminal development, said in February it would no longer take part in the project.France's  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) also signed preliminary deals last January to build the extension of Iran's Mashhad and Isfahan airports, the country's second and fifth biggest hubs, and negotiations with Iranian authorities on those are still ongoing.Iran remains a major potential market for construction firms.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Deutsche shares are now more than 88 percent below their 2007 peaks.Banks in Europe are grappling with deteriorating profits, slumping investment income on the back of collapsing yields and higher regulatory costs.Commerzbank's (DE:CBKG) warning on profits and negative interest rates sent its shares to a record low on Tuesday.While the results of the latest health check on regional banks by the European Banking Authority were greeted by investors with a sense of relief, the fact that the tests did not take into account interest rates staying negative for a long time has met with criticism.""If rates stay this low, interest income will not be that much of a contributor to the capital base and from that angle, it’s difficult to see the banks being in a strong position,"" Gerhard Schwarz, head of equity strategy at Baader Bank in Munich, said.Exclusion from a benchmark generally means that exchange-traded funds and other passive investors that track the index will be forced to sell the shares.The European banking index (SX7P) fell 2.8 percent, the worst sectoral performer, taking this year's total losses to more than 30 percent.The two banks will be replaced by technology firm ASML Holding (AS:ASML) and construction company  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) in the STOXX Europe 50 index (STOXX50). STOXX Ltd, which operates Deutsche Boerse Group's (DE:DB1Gn) index business, said late on Monday that the changes will become effective from Aug. 8."

STOXX could initiate a ""fast exit"" for Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank shares from the STOXX 50 if they rank below 74 at the end of next month in a selection list that rates European stocks on the basis on market cap and daily turnover.Infrastructure firms  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) could potentially replace them, SocGen adds.Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have lost 55 percent and 49.3 percent respectively this year as Britain's decision to leave the European Union worsened an already grim outlook for the banks hamstrung by sluggish markets, high regulatory costs and fines.Last week, the International Monetary Fund said Deutsche Bank's links to the world's largest lenders make it a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

75,"Jan 28, 2016 03:40PM ET","Protesters march, France eyes business deals as Iran's Rouhani visits",nan,"By Michel Rose and John IrishPARIS (Reuters) - France and Iran hailed the sale of Airbus planes and the renewal of a decades-old carmaking venture as symbols of thawing relations on Thursday while protesters in Paris tried to get human rights onto the agenda.President Hassan Rouhani was accompanied on his official visit to Paris, the first by an Iranian president since 1999, by ministers and business leaders who announced deals including a joint venture between carmakers PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) and Iran Khodro and plans for Iran to buy 118 Airbus (PA:AIR) passenger planes to update its aging fleet.His visit after a stop-off in Rome for more deals follows an agreement between Iran and the west on Iran's nuclear program, allowing the lifting of sanctions this month.The deals were signed at a ceremony attended by Rouhani and French President Francois Hollande. Construction group  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) and airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) are set to build an extension for Tehran airport, while  Vinci  (PA:SGEF), another building firm, is lined up to design, build and operate new terminals for the Mashhad and Ispahan airports.French oil company Total said it would buy some 200,000 barrels of Iranian crude from the OPEC producer. There were also deals in shipping, health, agriculture and water provision, all signed despite continued diplomatic tensions.DEALS UNFINISHED, BANKS WARYThe Airbus deal alone is worth $27 billion at list prices and French government sources put a 15 billion euro ($16 billion) overall tag on the agreements.But most have yet to be finalised or are subject to conditions. Senior French bankers have expressed wariness.Iran's industry minister Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh said an agreement between French export-credit group  Coface  (PA:COFA) and the Iranian central bank signed this week was an important step in the right direction.But he said French banks must support a corporate push into post-sanctions Iran. ""If they don't get active, there will be no increase in business,"" he warned. For Peugeot, the Iranian factory tie up is critical. When it suspended sales in Iran in 2012 it lost nearly 10 percent of global deliveries and interrupted a relationship dating back more than 50 years.Under Thursday's deal, set to be finalised in the middle of this year, Peugeot and Iran Khodro plan to modernize a factory near Tehran and be producing cars by mid 2017.They target an initial 200,000 vehicles a year making Peugeot 208, 2008 and 301 models with a Peugeot investment of 400 million euros ($436 million) over five years.Away from the signing ceremonies and speeches, an estimated 3,000 people marched through Paris seeking to raise awareness about human rights. A protestor from the Femen womens' activist group dangled in a mock hanging from a bridge with an Iranian flag painted across her naked chest.Human Rights Watch criticized Iran on the death penalty and abuse of rights of women and minorities. It also said the state of emergency declared by Hollande after Islamist militant attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 last year threatens rights to liberty and freedom of movement.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

89,"Jun 10, 2015 09:33AM ET","As Greece lurches toward default, businesses hit the wall",nan,"By Angeliki KoutantouATHENS (Reuters) - When construction of four 6.5 billion euro toll roads across Greece resumed last year, Greek and foreign businesses rejoiced.The motorways, largely funded by the European Union and built by companies including Germany's  Hochtief  (DE:HOTG), France's  Vinci  (PA:SGEF) and Greek firms  Ellaktor  (AT:HELr) and GEK Terna (AT:HRMr), had been halted in 2010. Last year, work resumed after the Greek government paid part of a fine to contractors for the four-year delay.Now, work has slowed once more. With aid from its bailout program frozen, the government has used its last cash to pay public sector wages and pensions, and service debt. That has left it without 230 million euros it needs to contribute its part of the financing for the road.The hole has put the entire project at risk again, one of many business ventures suffering amid the uncertainty of four months of negotiations between Athens and its international creditors.""As a country, we need to move as quickly as possible to strike a deal that will resolve issues being faced by big and small (infrastructure) projects,"" says George Sirianos, head of the association for big Greek construction firms.Paul Arnaoutis, whose firm sells imported medical supplies to Greek hospitals, has been waiting four months to be paid 1.3 million euros the state owes, nearly as much as his company's entire 2014 sales of 1.7 million.Until last year, his Chinese suppliers gave credit for 30-60 days. Now they are demanding cash up front because of the risk of doing business with Greece. He fears a doomsday scenario in which the government quits the euro and pays its bills with IOUs, which foreign suppliers will not accept.""If there is no deal and the government decided to take Greece out of the euro, all Greek importers would be ruined.""Meanwhile, his company is expected to pay tax on 335,000 euros in reported profit from last year, even though it still hasn't received most of the money for the sales: ""The profit is virtual"".Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras came to power this year promising to boost the economy by reversing years of wage reductions and other cost cutting that contributed to one of the biggest depressions in modern times. He still hopes to agree a deal that would keep aid flowing and avert a default by the end of this month.But even if a deal is clinched and Greece survives as a euro zone member, many companies are so battered by the cancellation of contracts, delays in state payments and the steady outflow of bank deposits that they will struggle to make up for losses.According to Greece's retailers association, about 59 businesses close down and some 613 jobs are being lost each day. It says about 95 percent of businesses' applications for loans are being rejected by commercial banks. Many small and medium-sized firms have stopped even asking banks for credit.SHATTERED HOPELast year, as Greece neared the end of its 240 billion euro bailout and fixed its finances, the economy emerged from a six-year recession. Many companies saw their sales stabilizing for the first time, helped by revived domestic demand.After shrinking by about a quarter since 2008, gross domestic output rose by 0.7 percent in 2014.But the recovery started fading late last year after then-Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pushed forward a presidential vote that ultimately triggered early elections and brought Tsipras's leftist government to power.Greek banks have since seen deposit outflows soar due to the uncertainty. Running out of cash, the state began to hold off on overdue payments to suppliers, adding to a liquidity squeeze.Gaia Wines, which produces 350,000 bottles of wine a year and exports 65 percent to the United States, Britain and 22 other countries, was to begin selling in New Zealand in April, but the first client there canceled its 4,000 euro order.""Our wines are of good quality. But people get scared because of the turmoil. This is reasonable,"" says co-owner Leon Karatsalos.The company has been waiting nearly a year for the government to respond to a request for access 150,000 euros in EU funds to renew equipment at one of its plants. The response was supposed to come by January but never came, says Karatsalos.The biggest contribution to renewed economic activity would come from getting infrastructure projects back up and running, economists and business people say.Greece risks losing EU co-financing earmarked for smaller infrastructure projects as part of a 2007-2013 EU funding program unless it finds its share of cash for the projects by the end of the year, Sirianos from the Greek construction firms' association said.""The (EU funding) program expires this year and any delay in tapping those funds should be addressed in one way or another,"" he said. ""If the state doesn't pay its contribution to [infrastructure projects]... contractors, particularly the small ones, cannot fund the Greek economy's growth.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

new risks to global recovery but are not yet strong enough to
derail it, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday. Concerns over high raw material prices hit soft drinks
bottler Coca-Coca Hellenic, which dropped 2.6 percent to feature

traders highlighting concerns that persistently high oil prices
would burden its costs.  Brent crude prices fell below $125 a barrel on Monday,

after the African Union said Libya's Gaddafi had accepted a
roadmap to end the civil war, but gains since the beginning of
the year have added almost 32 percent to its price, prompting
concern over the impact of sustained high prices. ""We also feel that the rise in oil prices, if sustained, has
the potential to be more damaging for some of the pro-cyclical
export sectors. Our preferences include financials, utilities
and to a lesser extent telecom,"" RBS analysts wrote in a note. Concerns over high raw material prices hit soft drinks

as the biggest faller on the FTSEurofirst 300 index, with
traders highlighting concerns that persistently high oil prices
would burden its costs.  (Additional reporting by Blaise Robinson in Paris; Editing

m.a. * Barclays, RBS rally on relief following ICB report * Construction stocks hit by Hochtief's profit warning * Strong quake in Japan rattles investors * For up-to-the-minute market news, click on  By Blaise Robinson PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - European stocks dipped early on
Monday as renewed worries that high commodity prices will bite
into companies' results prompted investors to book recent gains
following a brisk 3-week rally. A new earthquake of magnitude 7.1 in northeast Japan also
rattled investors, while a one-meter tsunami advisory was issued
for the coast. The losses were limited, however, as a main index hits
strong support on its 50-day moving average while heavyweight
mining shares such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton rallied along
with metal prices. At 0828 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,143.43 points, with strong
support around the index's 50-day moving average, at 1,144.87
points. ""Investors seem too complacent at the moment, ahead of the
earnings season. I'm cautious on the short term for stocks, with
concerns over cyclical sectors,"" said Frederic Buzare, global
head of equity management at Dexia Asset Management, which
manages about 86 billion euros ($124 billion). ""Cyclicals are not really attractive in terms of valuation
while the earnings momentum has started to turn, with rising
pressures on margins, and that hasn't been priced in analysts'
forecasts yet. Companies are facing rising input costs, and it
will start to hurt while sales volumes are not big enough to
absorb the shock."" Bucking the trend, mining shares rose along with metal
prices, with Rio Tinto up 0.7 percent and BHP Billiton up 1.7
percent. UK lenders Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland also gained
ground, up 3.1 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, on relief
following the release of Britain's Independent Commission on
Banking (ICB) report which seem to spare the two lenders. ""They've got away with it, apart from Lloyds which might
have to sell off more assets,"" said John Smith, senior fund
manager at Brown Shipley. ""It could have been harsher and
there's relief that it's been in line with expectations."" Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent,
while Germany's DAX index was down 0.7 percent, and France's CAC
40 down 0.7 percent. German construction group Hochtief dropped 9 percent after
slashing its outlook on an expected big loss at its Australian
Leighton unit. Lafarge, Holcim and Vinci fell 1.1-1.4 percent. Investors awaited results from U.S. bellwether Alcoa, set to
kick off the earnings season after the closing bell on Wall
Street on Monday.

 PARIS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - French public works group Vinci is
set to report first-half earnings before interest and taxes down
5.3 percent, at 1.354 billion euros ($1.94 billion), an average
of six analysts polled by Reuters showed. The average net profit was seen down 12.9 percent, at 637
million euros, the poll showed, as the economic downturn is
taking it toll on margins. Last year, Vinci reported first-half EBIT of 1.43 billion
euros, and a net income of 731 million euros. The world's biggest construction and concession group is due
to report its first-half 2009 earning results on August 31,
after the market's close, followed with an analyst call on
September 1 at 0630 GMT and a news conference at 0900 GMT. Analysts said they would look for any indication on
full-year 2009 objectives and a possible confirmation of a
pickup in motorway traffic during the summer. The impact of the different stimulus packages implemented in
countries where Vinci operates is also expected, as it had not
benefited the group's ""contracting"" division by the end of the
second quarter. Analysts said they would also focus on possible lower
margins as the world economy remains weak, as well as the
distribution of the group's sales in France and overseas. Vinci secured a number of big contracts outside its domestic
market in the first half of the year, including a 1.2 billion
euro public-private partnership (PPP) road project in Slovakia,
a 1 billion euro project for the Moscow-Saint Petersburg
motorway, as well as 323 million euros for the Cairo metro. The group last month reported sales down 3.2 percent, at
15.2 million euros, and maintained its objective announced last
March of a stabilisation in revenue from French road concessions
and a limited fall in revenue from ""contracting"" (Construction,
Energy and Roads).

Thursday with construction stocks gaining after Holcim results
pleased investors, while banks and commodity stocks performed
well. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
up 1.4 percent at 944.94 points. The index has risen more than
46 percent from its lifetime low on March 9 as investors have
become more confident over the prospects of recovery. ""The good performance today is partly linked to
better-than-expected numbers from Holcim and Ahold ... as well
as the strong rebound in China, which has had quite a setback,""
said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research. Sentiment improved after Chinese stocks surged 4.5 percent,
posting their second biggest daily percentage gain of the year,
as modest signs of official support for the market helped to
trigger technical buying after a 20 percent dive in the two
weeks up to Wednesday's close. Construction stocks were among the top performers. Cement
maker Holcim gained 5.7 percent after it said the government
stimulus packages in the U.S. and Europe would boost the
construction industry next year after the downturn in the United
States eased in the second quarter. Vinci, Lafarge and CRH were up 3.3 to 4.7 percent. Dutch supermarket group Ahold was 3.9 percent higher after
it reported second-quarter profit above forecasts, as it
increased market share and clamped down on costs, convincing
investors of its operational strength.    Banks added the most
points to the index.  UBS rose 4.5 percent after Switzerland sold its stake in the
bank, at the top end of its price range, a source said, making a
profit from last year's rescue deal.    Banco Santander, BNP
Paribas and Nordea Banks were up between 1.4 to 3.2 percent.  OILS TRACK CRUDE HIGHER Energy shares were higher as crude steadied at around $72 a
barrel after a drawdown in U.S. inventories. BG Group, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total were between 1.4
to 2.5 percent higher. Miners gained, with Rio Tinto up 1 percent as it positioned
itself for a comeback after posting a record drop in half-year
profit and selling off shares and assets to slash debt. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Eurasian Natural
Resources Corporation and Xstrata were up between 1.9 to 5.3
percent. Some strategists remained cautious, with stocks paring gains
earlier after the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for
jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week as companies
continued to cut payrolls amid uncertainty over the economic
outlook. Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits
rose 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 576,000 in the week ended
Aug. 15 from 561,000 the prior week, the U.S. Labor Department
said. ""Chart analysts would say global equity indexes are looking
very overbought,"" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, strategist at
Charles Stanley. ""The breadth of the rally is encouraging the
optimists to believe this is the real thing. ""I would argue that equity markets' performance is in line
with a V-shaped recovery, but the economic recovery has been
muted at best. Earnings have beaten forecast, but the top line
has been disappointing. How long can companies pull off this
trick of increasing earnings by cutting costs?"" Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was up 1.4 percent,

 (Adds details) PARIS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - French construction firm Eiffage
SA  posted a 9 percent fall in full-year net profit
which missed analyst forecasts and said the second half of 2008
was marked by a drop-off in growth across its units. Eiffage, which competes against larger rival Vinci SA
, had 2008 net profit of 301 million euros ($383.3
million) compared to 1 billion euros a year earlier.  Stripping out exceptionals, net profit in 2008 was 302
million euros, down 9.3 percent from 333 million euros a year
earlier. This lagged an average forecast of 373.15 million euros
from ten analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Eiffage, the builder of the Sydney Opera House and the
world's tallest suspension bridge near Millau in France, said it
was maintaining its dividend of 1.20 euros per share.  Its shares closed down 0.47 percent at 31.85 euros on
Thursday, lagging a 1.78 percent rise in the CAC 40 . Eiffage said its strong positioning in France and the
Benelux countries, adaptation measures in the Spanish peninsula
and reinforced control structures would help boost revenue by
3.55 percent to 13.7 billion euros this year. This would beat an average forecast of 13.5 billion by 12
analysts polled by Reuters. It said 2008 sales rose 5 percent to 13.23 billion euros
from 12.596 billion euros a year earlier, thanks to its solid
position in France, particularly in the construction and energy
sectors. Eiffage sold a 16.7 percent stake in toll road group
Cofiroute and a 49 percent stake in the Millau suspended road
viaduct to reap a net capital gain of 667 million euros in 2007. Eiffage had said earlier this month that its sales declined
in the fourth quarter by 7.6 percent but its orderbook rose 6.1
percent to 10.4 billion euros. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Eiffage had sales of 3.331
billion euros against 3.585 billion. The company came out of a bitter battle last year with Sacyr
Vallehermoso , with Eiffage rejecting the Spanish
group's moves to take control of the company.
