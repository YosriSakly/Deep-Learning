4,"Apr 11, 2019 04:02AM ET",StockBeat - Luxury Goods Shine After Another Big Quarter for LVMH,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It’s been a tough 12 months for most sectors in Europe’s stock market. Exporters of capital goods have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war, banks and financial services hobbled by negative interest rates, consumer stocks struggling to escape the shackles of low wage growth and demographic decline.But one sector has been a relatively constant bright light, and it’s leading the way again this Thursday. Luxury goods makers are roaring ahead after another strong quarter for LVMH (PA:LVMH), the French drinks-to-fashion group.LVMH announced after the bell on Wednesday that its revenue grew 16% on the year in the first quarter and said the positive trends that had helped it to a record year in 2018 were still in place. Most remarkably, in a world economy that is supposedly suffering a synchronized slowdown, the group said that “all geographic regions are experiencing good growth.”The news has sent the stock up 3.1% on a day when most indexes are down, due in part to frustration at the prospect of another six months of uncertainty over Brexit.  As of 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was at 385.12, down 1.56 points or 0.4%. The FTSE 100 was down 0.5%, while the German DAX was down 0.4%. The Paris CAC 40 was outperforming, down less than 0.1%, thanks mainly to its luxury names.As has often been the case, LVMH’s performance is supporting the rest of the sector. Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and scarf-maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) were close behind it at the top of the CAC 40, while Italian rivals Salvatore Ferragamo  (MI:SFER) and Moncler (MI:MONC) were also both among the best performers in Milan.The results have distracted attention away from one less pleasant piece of news that may come back to haunt the sector in due course. French police raided the premises of some of the country’s drinks makers on Wednesday on suspicion of anti-competitive practices.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a drinks maker that doesn’t have the same exposure to fashion as the other stocks in the sector, is the notable laggard this morning, rising only 0.3%."

6,"Mar 01, 2019 04:16AM ET",MarketPulse Europe: Strong Data Fuel Hopes That Economy Is Bottoming Out,nan,"By Geoffrey SmithInvesting.com -- It used to be said that when the U.S. sneezes, Europe caught a cold. That may still be true, but what is also true that when China gets off its sick bed, Europe’s stock markets go for a run.After a brief setback on Thursday morning in the wake of the U.S.-North Korea summit breakdown, European markets are again racing higher, taking their cue from Asian markets.The Stoxx 600 was up 0.7% at 375.46 by 04:20 AM ET (0920 GMT). Germany's Dax led the way, rising 1.2%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 lagged, rising only 0.6%.Asian markets had rallied on two things overnight: first, MSCI announced it would give a much greater weighting to China’s mainland shares in future, triggering a sharp rally in that market; second, the Caixin manufacturing survey showed a surprising uptick in February, further raising hopes that the global economy is bottoming out after the slowdown at the end of last year.Add stronger-than-expected retail sales out of Germany this morning, a slight upward revision to the Eurozone purchasing managers index for February and a much steeper-than-expected fall in joblessness in Germany, and a very broad-based rally this morning becomes easier to understand.However, it also weakens the case for action by the European Central Bank at its policy meeting next week. Normally, that would be a negative for stocks, but as former IMF economist Ashoka Mody argued in a recent blog post, the Eurozone economy now appears to react less to ECB policy than it does to developments in global trade.The fact that the narrower Stoxx 50 index is being led this morning by luxury goods groups  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) and a bunch of trade-sensitive auto stocks seems to support Mody’s argument.Among the other individual stocks standing out are U.K. fund manager Jupiter (LON:JUP), which is up 10% after accelerating a changeover of its top management and publishing full-year figures that were less awful than expected. The stock has been one of the most shorted in the London market, and was thus vulnerable to short-covering. Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa), meanwhile, is trailing the market, rising only 0.3% after news that Dutch prosecutors are preparing to charge it over allegations of bribery in Nigeria."
7,"Feb 01, 2019 04:46AM ET","MarketPulse Europe: Trade Hopes Lift Automakers, Luxury Groups",nan,"Hopes for a thaw in U.S.-Chinese relations nudged European stocks higher early Friday, with trade-sensitive industrials and luxury goods groups leading the way and distracting attention from weak manufacturing surveys and disappointing banking results.At 05:00 AM ET (10.00 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 0.04% at 3160.75Shares in automakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) were all higher after U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at a summit meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in February to reach a deal that would end the threat of fresh U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.Europe’s automakers have been caught badly in the middle of that trade war, since a large part of their sales in China come from their plants in the U.S. and are vulnerable to Chinese countermeasures.Luxury goods makers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), which had suffered in recent weeks amid signs of a Chinese economic slowdown, were also among the Euro Stoxx 50 leaders, while smaller rivals Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER), Moncler (MI:MONC) and  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) also gained.The moves suggest that trade news counts for more than another set of weak manufacturing surveys. Markit’s flash Purchasing Manager Index readings for January, released Friday, showed contraction in China, Germany and Italy. The U.K. PMI also slowed more than forecast, although it stayed above the 50 level that indicates growth.Elsewhere, it was Groundhog Day for European banks.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) continued its slide for a third day after disappointing again, with a net loss for the fourth quarter after a 23% slump in revenue at its core bond and currency trading business. Caixabank (MC:CABK) and Sabadell (MC:SABE), two of Spain’s largest banks, also fell more than 5% after missing fourth-quarter estimates, although BBVA (MC:BBVA) rose: the sale of its Chilean business and a solid performance in Mexico helped to offset weakness in crisis-hit Turkey.  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), which was hit last year by a money-laundering scandal, edged up 0.8% as its fourth-quarter report passed without any new shocks."

9,"Jan 30, 2019 05:12AM ET",MarketPulse Europe:  China More Important Than Brexit as Stocks Head Higher,nan,"Investing.com -- Stocks in Europe were mostly higher after early trading on Wednesday, as two positive items of China-related news outweighed a fresh bout of nerves over Brexit.The morning’s mood was set by two quarterly reports – from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and from French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH)- that came after the European close on Tuesday and reassured traders that demand from China is still holding up nicely.LVMH said revenue hit a record high in 2018, finishing the year with a 9% year-on-year rise in the fourth quarter. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told the Wall Street Journal that spending by Chinese customers either in China or on trips abroad grew by double digits for most of its major brands in the quarter, and that there had been no visible slowdown at the end of the year. LVMH shares were up 6.9% by 04.55 AM ET (09.55 GMT), and the results also pulled rivals Hermes (PA:HRMS) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) up to the top of the French CAC 40 index. The U.K.'s  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) also rose in sympathy.U.K. stocks posted mixed reactions to the votes in parliament last night that reaffirmed a ‘no-deal’ Brexit as the default option for March 29 and rejected the chance to call for an extension of a deadline that’s now less than two months away.The British pound lost nearly 1% against the dollar and euro on the votes but had recovered much of those losses by mid-morning. At 04:55 AM ET, the GBPUSD was at $1.3117, up over half a cent from its overnight lows. As usual, the FTSE 100’s big tobacco and resource companies, which book most of their revenues in dollars, led the index, while domestic-focused companies lagged."
10,"Jan 28, 2019 06:00AM ET","MarketPulse Europe - Miners Buck Gloomy Trend Ahead of Fed, Key Trade Talks",nan,"Investing.com -- Mining stocks were a rare bright spot in generally weak stock markets in Asia and Europe Monday, as traders priced in the risk that the world could be left short of iron ore if Brazil's authorities crack down on mining giant Vale (NYSE:VALE).Markets were otherwise broadly on hold ahead of key economic and political events - notably the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting - due later this week. The STOXX 600 was down 0.4% at 356.48 at 06:05 AM ET (11:05 GMT).Vale's biggest rivals,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) outperformed local markets in the U.K. Monday on speculation they would profit from higher prices if Vale's production plans are disrupted.The world’s largest iron ore producer, Vale is the operator of a tailings dam in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais that burst last week, leaving at least 58 dead and hundreds more missing. Over the weekend, Standard & Poor's put its credit rating on review for a downgrade, while the Brazilian authorities froze $3 billion of its assets to cover potential penalties.Vale’s ADRs in New York lost 8.1% on Friday and are set to open down another 7.5% on Monday.Earlier, there was more gloom about the state of the global economy after research institute Ifo reported Germany’s exporters have sharply cut their expectations for 2019. It said the key auto, chemicals and engineering sectors were all downbeat about their prospects. Bayer (DE:BAYGN) fell 1.2%, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz, were down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.Luxury goods makers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) were also among the biggest losers in Europe on nervousness for Chinese demand ahead of key trade talks between the Chinese and U.S. governments on Wednesday. Gucci owner Kering was also suffering after weekend reports that it faces a $1.6 billion tax bill in Italy."

12,"Jan 17, 2019 10:40AM ET",Audemars Piguet and Swiss watch rivals hasten shift to in-house sales,nan,"By Silke Koltrowitz and Sarah WhiteGENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille are snapping up stakes in their franchised shops, seeking to tighten their grip on the sales network as a growing number of top brands ditch wholesalers.Changes to distribution for luxury watches have lagged sectors such as groceries or fashion, with eye-watering price tags seen as a barrier to buying online and favoring a more traditional sales approach. But trouble clearing excess inventory at multi-brand watch retailers, and the lure of better margins, is persuading some labels to cut their reliance on the third-party resellers that still account for around 75 percent of industry sales, according to analysts. Family-owned Audemars Piguet, which has said it aimed to have only monobrand stores in three to five years' time, is also investing in some of the around 30 franchises that already carry its name.Out of a total 200 points of sale, it has 60 monobrand outlets but only 25 are fully-owned for now. The company is taking a majority stake in a Los Angeles franchise in an example of efforts to better control its image, Chief Executive Francois-Henry Bennahmias told Reuters. ""Between our stores in Rome and New York City a client could hear slightly different narratives, and we can't afford that,"" Bennahmias said at the SIHH trade fair in Geneva this week.KNOWING THE CUSTOMERThe shift in-house is not universal, with giants like privately-owned Rolex and Patek Philippe staying the course with multi-brands.For their part, some smaller independent brands simply cannot afford the higher fixed cost and ensuing risk attached to monobrand stores. But  Richemont  (S:CFR), owner of the Cartier and IWC brands, is among those moving more stores in-house at some of its labels. Sixty-three percent of its revenue comes from its own shops, up from 42 percent a decade ago.Audemars said its strategy was boosting sales. These grew 10 percent last year to 1.1 billion Swiss francs ($1.11 billion) - with half coming now from monobrand stores. ""It's huge. It's the point of no return,"" Bennahmias said. Ultra high-end Richard Mille, with average prices of around 180,000 euros ($205,236), already derives 75 percent of sales from its 40 monobrand boutiques, many of which are franchises it has invested in, marketing director Tim Malachard said. Launched in 2001, the label aimed to eventually phase multi-brand retailers out - it sells via 44 now - and reach 50 to 55 single-brand stores, he added. ""It allows us to get to know our clients. And there is no discounting,"" Malachard said. SURVIVORSThe industry is still reeling from a downturn, after a crackdown on luxury gift giving in China and the collapse of Hong Kong's market that has taken time to recover. That pushed brands like Cartier into buying back stocks languishing at distributors in recent years, to stop them being dumped at discounted prices on the so-called ""gray"" market. While momentum has recovered - in spite of renewed concerns about a Chinese slowdown - firms are also tussling over how to attract younger consumers who grew up using smartphones rather than watches. ""Clients want to buy watches but they also want an experience,"" said Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Hublot. It is cutting back on wholesalers too, though it expects them to still make up half of sales in the long term. ""The multi-brand retailers that used to stock 50 labels are disappearing little by little, only the big players will be left,"" Guadalupe said. For some small watchmakers, however, solo stores are an unaffordable gambit. ""Smaller independent brands cannot do without wholesale distributors,"" said Marco Tedeschi, CEO of Switzerland's RJ, which plans to produce 1,200 pieces this year, including some themed around Batman villains. RJ is however switching to distributors stocking fewer brands, which might do more to help promote its watches, Tedeschi added. MB&F, which makes 250 of its futuristic timepieces a year, now reaps up to a quarter of sales through a handful of art gallery joint ventures, from Geneva to Dubai - providing it with another way of reaching customers, said communications head Charris Yadigaroglou. ""Not all of the retailers will survive,"" he added.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

13,"Jan 14, 2019 01:51PM ET",Swiss watchmakers brace for slowing Chinese demand,nan,"By Silke Koltrowitz and Sarah WhiteGENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are starting to see signs of slowing spending from Chinese tourists, but are still banking on demand shifting to mainland China to fuel growth this year, several high-end brands said on Monday.Investors are on edge over a softening economic backdrop in China, and weak Chinese trade data on Monday sent shares in luxury goods companies that rely heavily on Chinese customers tumbling.Some brands like Parmigiani, owned by the Sandoz Family Foundation and which makes around 3,000 pieces a year, with average prices at 35,000 Swiss francs ($35,714), said they believed it was still a good time to invest in China.""People are traveling less, but consuming more domestically so it is the right moment for us to strengthen our local presence (in China),"" chief executive Davide Traxler told Reuters at the SIHH industry trade fair in Geneva, adding the label, in turnaround mode, was entering that market ""10 years late"".Parmigiani is repositioning itself at higher price points after trying to take a more accessible tack a few years ago.Chinese customers make up over a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, but a falling yuan and Chinese government measures like cuts in import taxes are pushing more of those shoppers to splurge domestically. Business in Hong Kong lost steam in the last three months of 2018, Cartier owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) reported on Friday, and others noted setbacks there and in other parts of Greater China, which includes Macau. ""We had growth everywhere last year, except for Greater China where we saw a dip in demand due to the trade war in October and November,"" said Edouard Meylan, chief executive of independent Swiss label H. Moser & Cie.""It has recovered since,"" Meylan said. He added the brand had sold an unusual amount of ""big-ticket"" watches in December and January, but was still wary of nasty surprises. ""With the shutdown (in the U.S.), the trade war and Brexit, there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment.""STILL GROWINGManufacturers of luxury wares from handbags to fancy timepieces have so far played down the chances of a dramatic fallout from a U.S.- China trade stand-off, arguing that appetite from young, middle-class Chinese customers keen to wear branded goods was likely to hold up in the long term. ""We've noticed a small slowdown, but we're still talking about a growth pattern,"" said Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Hublot brand, which is not exhibiting its watches at the Richemont-dominated SIHH but at a hotel in downtown Geneva. Young Chinese clients in their 20s and 30s boosted demand for Hublot watches in 2018, Guadalupe added. ""In principle this dynamic is going to continue, unless there is a real catastrophe in terms of the geopolitical relations between China and the United States,"" he told Reuters.Hublot, a stablemate of Tag Heuer and Zenith at LVMH, does not break out revenues. But its sales in Greater China - which accounts for 13 percent of its revenues - rose by 60 percent last year, Guadalupe said, helped partly by Hublot's status as a relatively new entrant in China, where it first invested 10 years ago.That growth could be closer to 10 to 15 percent in 2019 as comparisons get tougher, he added, while Hublot is banking on its global comparable sales expanding by at least 6 to 7 percent after 16 percent growth in 2018.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

LVMH, the firm behind fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, already has hotels including the Cheval Blanc in the prestigious Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps, as well as Bvlgari hotels.The Belmond deal is LVMH's largest since it spent 4.3 billion euros in 2011 to buy Bvlgari and 6.5 billion euros in 2017 to gain full control of Christian Dior.It will have a limited impact of its debt and boost 2018 earnings per share, before synergies by just 0.1 percent.LVMH will ""reach critical mass in the ultimate luxury hotel world with one single acquisition,"" finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a call.""The priority is to develop and improve the profitability of these exceptional brands and nurture complementarity with the LVMH group brands,"" he addedThe acquisition will give it properties including the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in southern Peru, Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian riviera and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, moving LVMH further into the fast-growing ""experiential"" high-end travel and hospitality sector.The transaction follows a wave of deals in the luxury hotels sector, including AccorHotels' (PA:ACCP) purchase of FRHI Holdings, the parent of the Fairmont and Raffles hotels.""While some investors may question the acquisition, which appears to lie outside LVMH group's core operations, we believe it is consistent with its long-term strategy focused on offering the consumer a full spectrum of luxury experience,"" Berenberg analysts said in a research note. ""LUXURY EXPERIENCES""Guiony said the deal reflected LVMH's belief that ""the future of luxury is in luxury goods and in luxury experiences"".It also pushes LVMH further into new luxury services at a time of growing concern that Chinese demand for high-end fashion and handbags will start waning amid worries about the health of the world's second-largest economy and potential damage from Washington's protracted trade spat with Beijing.LVMH said it would pay $25 per Belmond share, a 40 percent premium to Thursday's closing price. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2019, values Belmond's equity at $2.6 billion, and the group, including debt, at $3.2 billion.Belmond posted earnings of $140 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on revenue of $572 million in the 12 months to Sept. 30. Half of revenue comes from Europe and 20 percent from North America.At 1520 GMT, LVMH shares were down 0.9 percent at 253.45 euros in a weak European stock market (FTEU3) while Belmond shares jumped 40 percent in New York to $24.74.RBC Capital Markets analysts said the price of the deal - at 5.6 times recent sales and 22.9 times recent EBITDA - looked ""optically high"", but added: ""Belmond owns a unique portfolio of trophy real estate assets, that will allow LVMH to increase its exposure to experiential luxury"".LVMH ended up paying a multiple of 19 times Belmond’s expected EBITDA for next year, according to Refinitiv data. Bigger hotel chains like Hilton and Marriott International (O:MAR) trade on forward multiples of just over 12 times.Belmond owns, partly owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants and train and river-cruise properties located in exotic and distinctive destinations worldwide.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Unless U.S.-China trade talks wrap up successfully by March 1, new tariffs will be imposed, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday, clarifying there is a ""hard deadline"".Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) and STMicro (PA:STM) fell 2.9 to 5.1 percent as investors ditched the tech sector.Outside of trade, politics drove some of the biggest moves. French retail, hotel, and transport stocks tumbled anew after a fourth weekend of ""yellow vest"" protests which are disrupting the economy.LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among the biggest drags on the STOXX. But France's CAC 40 (FCHI) overall did not underperform European peers, down just 0.6 percent. Shares in British energy utilities  Centrica  (L:CNA) and SSE (L:SSE) fell around 3 percent as investors held their breath ahead of a crucial vote on Brexit on Tuesday. Traders said a Sunday Telegraph report flagging a risk Centrica may struggle to pay its dividend was also hurting sentiment. British housebuilders Berkeley Group (L:BKGH),  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and Barratt Development (L:BDEV) fell 1.5 to 2.5 percent as nerves built and Peel Hunt cut its ratings.Outside large-cap moves, shares in  Interserve  (L:IRV) plunged as much as 71 percent, last trading down 51 percent, after the embattled British outsourcer said it was in talks with debtholders and considering converting debt to equity.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 1.8 percent, set for its strongest day in eight months. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a truce at the G20 meeting on Saturday, halting additional tariffs and agreeing to fresh talks aimed at reaching an agreement within 90 days.Although markets reacted positively, some investors and analysts said there remained much for the two to agree upon. ""While President Trump described the bilateral meeting with China as ""amazing and productive"", we believe the rivalry between the U.S. and China will not be easily overcome, especially over the issue of intellectual property and market access,"" said UBS Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele in a note.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said the announcement strengthened their view that ""Trump is likely to want to conclude an agreement - even if it does not include a full rollback of tariffs - well ahead of the 2020 presidential election"".Financials were the biggest driver of European shares as China-exposed bank HSBC (L:HSBA) rose and investors cheered the prospect of a end to a trade war which has dented growth.Mining stocks (SXPP) led the gains and were up 5.1 percent on the news which gives China, the world's biggest metals consumer, more wiggle room in the next few months. Antofagasta  (L:ANTO),  Anglo American  (L:AAL), and  Glencore  (L:GLEN) were up 6.2 to 8.6 percent.Car stocks (SXAP), which have been battered by fears of rising tariffs, jumped 4.2 percent after Trump said China agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars.German carmakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG), and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) climbed 4.8 to 6.2 percent, while tire maker Continental (DE:CONG) gained 4.1 percent and  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) rose 6.9 percent.Tech stocks (SX8P) jumped 3.1 percent with chipmakers the best-performing. Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), and AMS (S:AMS) gained 5.8 to 6.7 percent. Overall analysts have cut their 2019 earnings growth expectations for world stocks over the past month as concern grew that a trade war would compound the impact of a slowing global economy. The oil sector (SXEP) also jumped 2.7 percent as crude soared ahead of this week’s OPEC meeting, expected to result in a supply cut.Luxury stocks highly sensitive to China were also among top gainers, with heavyweight conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH) up 5.9 percent and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) rising 6.1 percent.Away from the trade war relief, shares in French supermarkets  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and  Casino  (PA:CASP), underperformed after riots in Paris on Saturday.Carrefour was down 1.1 percent and Casino was up just 0.5 percent, while France's main CAC 40 rose 2 percent.Argenx (BR:ARGX) topped the STOXX with an 11.3 percent gain after the Netherlands-based biopharma company said it signed a deal worth potentially up to $1.6 billion with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) affiliate Cilag to develop its Cusatuxumab drug in certain types of cancer.Graphic: global earnings growth expectations dec 3 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Q9fNPZ  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

24,"Nov 30, 2018 05:03AM ET",Autos and miners drag Europe down as weak China and trade fears sap confidence,nan,"By Helen ReidLONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Friday as weak data from China rekindled anxiety over slowing growth and investors fretted ahead of Saturday's crucial G20 talks between U.S. President Trump and China's Xi Jinping over trade.The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) opened marginally up but rapidly fell into negative territory, down 0.5 percent by 0930 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI), the most sensitive to China due to its big exporters, fell 0.6 percent. The DAX was set for its fourth straight month of losses - its longest losing streak since 2008. The pan-European STOXX was set for its second straight month of losses as November, and a disappointing earnings season, draw to a close.Investors' hopes of a partial recovery in stock markets in December - known as a ""Santa rally"" - hang on the leaders' discussions resulting in a truce or de-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.""There are only two people in the world that can deliver a Santa rally, Trump and Xi, and I don't see that happening,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Garnry saw a 60 to 65 percent chance of the Trump-Xi talks resulting in ""no deal"".China reported its weakest factory growth in more than two years on Friday, reigniting fears about growth ahead of crucial trade talks.""The weak data out of China is increasingly a little bit of a surprise. Most investors would have anticipated that at least some of that stimulus six months ago would have had an impact, but this really tells us how big the headwinds are,"" said Garnry.Autos stocks (SXAP) were the worst-performing, down 1.4 percent, on the data and anxiety over tariffs.German car bosses are finalizing plans to visit the White House next week to discuss trade policy, German and U.S. officials said.Car parts makers were among the worst-performing stocks, with Hella (DE:HLE),  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), and tire maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) down 2.4 to 4.9 percent. Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) dragged the DAX down with a 2.7 percent fall, while peers BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 0.8 to 0.9 percent. ""The problem with Europe is that... quite a lot of our industrial supply chain and capital goods manufacturers have at least some exposure to the autos sector, so you can't get away from it,"" said Ian Ormiston, European smaller companies fund manager at Merian Global Investors. HSBC analysts downgraded both Faurecia and Daimler to ""reduce"" from ""hold"", saying a re-rating for the sector next year is ""hard to imagine"". Tariff fears have led analysts to slash their earnings growth forecasts for the sector.Mining stocks (SXPP) fell 1.1 percent, hit by growth fears over China, the world's top metals consumer.Among the biggest drags on the STOXX were also luxury goods conglomerates  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH), down 1.8 percent each. Luxury stocks have been especially sensitive to slowing growth in China, high-end brands' biggest market. In single-stock moves Altice (AS:ATCA) shares surged 9.4 percent after the telecoms and cable firm announced its French unit had agreed to sell a 49.99 percent stake in its fiber optic business.Zalando (DE:ZALG) fell 4.2 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut its price target on the stock, saying it has become more skeptical about the long-term potential for margins at the online retailer.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

25,"Nov 23, 2018 04:16AM ET",Dolce & Gabbana founders seek 'forgiveness' in China with video apology,nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Dolce & Gabbana's co-founders asked for China's ""forgiveness"" on Friday, trying to salvage a crucial market for the luxury brand after a backlash against its latest advertising campaign.The Italian fashion house canceled a marquee show in Shanghai on Wednesday after celebrities and social media users threatened a boycott over the campaign, which led e-commerce firms to pull Dolce & Gabbana items on Thursday.The furor is a setback for one of Italy's best-known fashion brands in China, where rivals from Louis Vuitton of LVMH (PA:LVMH) to Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci are vying to expand. Chinese buyers account for more than a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, and are increasingly shopping at home rather than on overseas trips. Users slammed the video campaign in which a Chinese woman struggles to eat pizza and pasta with chopsticks while the narrator offers eating lessons in a patronizing tone.The blunder was compounded when screenshots were circulated online of a private Instagram conversation, in which designer Stefano Gabbana makes a reference to ""China Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia"" and uses the smiling poo emoji to describe the country. The company said Gabbana's account had been hacked.In a video apology on Friday, Gabbana and co-founder Domenico Dolce said they had ""reflected seriously"" and were saddened by the impact of their words.""In the face of our cultural misunderstanding, we hope that we can earn your forgiveness,"" Dolce, speaking in Italian, said in the video of the two designers seated side-by-side. The 85-second video with Chinese subtitles was posted on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. Gabbana also asked for forgiveness and offered a formal apology to Chinese people around the world. The designers ended the video by saying sorry in Mandarin.""We will never forget this experience and lesson, and this sort of thing will never happen again,"" Gabbana said.It's not the first gaffe by Dolce & Gabbana in China, where the brand came under fire on social media last year for a series of advertisements showing the grungy side of Chinese life. Other upsets have come and gone in China without appearing to cause lasting damage, including at brands like Kering's Balenciaga, which apologized in April amid a backlash over how some Chinese customers had been treated in Paris.However, the crisis for Dolce & Gabbana showed no sign of easing on Friday. Retailer Lane Crawford said it would pull the brand from its stores and online sites in mainland China and Hong Kong after customers had returned Dolce & Gabbana items.Most of the comments posted under the apology video on Weibo were also critical.""We don't have to accept your apology. Go and make money in other countries, there's none for you here in China,"" one user wrote.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

27,"Nov 15, 2018 06:44AM ET",China's stay-at-home shoppers propel luxury sales: Bain,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Luxury brands will increasingly have to court Chinese shoppers on their home turf, as local purchases soar among a clientele who are forecast to generate nearly half the industry's sales by 2025, a study showed on Thursday. Global sales of personal luxury goods like handbags and watches are on course to grow 6 percent at constant currencies this year, on par with 2017, according to consultancy Bain and Italian manufacturers association Altagamma's report, which valued the market at 260 billion euros ($294 billion) in 2018.That pace will slow in the medium term to 3 to 5 percent per year, they forecast, with potential ""bumps"" along the way like the risk of a U.S. recession or an easing pace of China's economic growth. But leaving aside worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war's impact on high-end labels, Chinese consumers will continue to grow in stature for the luxury industry. Accounting for 33 percent of purchases now, they will anchor 46 percent of the market by 2025, the report said. Half of those sales are forecast to take place within China by then, up from a quarter today, against the backdrop of a global industry landscape that for the most part remains benign. ""The market fundamentals are very sound,"" Federica Levato, a partner at Bain, said. ""There could be some slight slowdown in the near future, in the next 12 to 18 months, (but) we don't think this will distract brands from a very solid market.""China's luxury shoppers are already propelling sales bounces at brands from France's Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, owned by LVMH (PA:LVMH), to Italian puffer jacker maker Moncler (MI:MONC). At one of the fastest-growing labels, Italy's Gucci, some 45 percent of Chinese clients' purchases already take place domestically, executives at parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) detailed in October. Narrowing price differentials compared with other regions for goods like handbags, import tax cuts by Beijing and spikes in the euro against the yuan have all helped to repatriate spending.GEN Z ON THE RISELuxury items cost 70 or 80 percent more in China than in Europe as recently as 2015, Levato said, with the average premium closer to 25 or 30 percent now. Habits are evolving rapidly as a result, with Chinese tourists no longer visiting fashion capitals like Paris just to pick up bargains.""They are now traveling for the experience. Of course they will also buy luxury goods, but it's not the first driver of traveling,"" Levato said. Rather than open more shops, brands are expanding online in China and considering partnerships with Chinese e-commerce giants like  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and JD.com (O:JD) to reach potential consumers in far-flung cities.In China and beyond, the dominance of ever-younger consumers is pushing labels to invest in social media marketing or churn out collections more often to cater to the smartphone generation who are used to shopping differently. Millenials, or those now roughly aged between 22 and 37, and the ""Gen Z"" generation right behind them, were the exclusive drivers of global sales growth in 2018, Bain said. From around a third of the market now, those younger shoppers are forecast to account for some 55 percent of revenues by 2025. The shifting age profile of luxury buyers is also reflected in sliding footfall in department stores, one sales channel that lost ground in 2018, while online shopping picked up. In China, luxury sales at constant currencies are on course to grow 20 percent in 2018 from 2017, but momentum has been weaker in Europe and the United States, where luxury goods sales are forecast to expand 3 percent and 5 percent respectively.

28,"Nov 12, 2018 04:50AM ET","China's Ruyi, pretender to LVMH's throne, plots more 'affordable luxury' deals",nan,"By Kane Wu and Pei LiHONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's acquisitive apparel firm Shandong Ruyi is targeting more global deals involving ""affordable luxury"" brands, under a push to establish the first high-end Chinese fashion empire to eventually challenge behemoth LVMH (PA:LVMH).Its chairman, Qiu Yafu, who has led a spate of deals buying tailors Gieves & Hawkes to Swiss luxury brand Bally, told Reuters on Monday the company would focus on affordable luxury, where he sees growth even amid broader economic slowdown.Qiu, a little-known billionaire with a low-profile even in China, has big ambitions in the world of fashion, where his growing empire is leading the race in China to rival established fashion houses in the traditionally European dominated industry.The magnate, who started as an apprentice at the age of 17 at one of Ruyi's textile mills, has built up control of a range of European luxury brands through aggressive acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including French fashion house SMCP and Britain's Aquascutum.Qiu, tall and wearing a dark fitted suit and red tie, said the broader Ruyi group wanted to become as big as LVMH, though added that wouldn't happen overnight.""LV is a world renowned god-like enterprise. It is our role model. We are still a far cry from it but that's our vision,"" Qiu, who was born in 1958, told Reuters during an interview in Hong Kong on the sidelines of a luxury industry conference.""Would it take five years, 10 years, even longer, or for the next generation or a better team to achieve? It is a very important project and challenge. It may even be impossible. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't learn, imitate or borrow ideas.""Qiu added the firm would ""pursue"" deals for quality ""trend-setter"" brands with sustainable development prospects, though he was less interested in brands he likened to ""pop music, only catering to people's tastes for a short while but not lasting"".""Ruyi has firm and specific requirements and strategic positioning for fashion brands. We are always studying and watching brands that fit the positioning of high quality, high growth and high pricing,"" he said.Ruyi and Qiu are looking to help brands target China's huge but slowing domestic apparel market, which research firm Euromonitor expects will hit 2.2 trillion yuan ($316.05 billion) by 2022, up around 10 percent from its current size. To that end, he said the firm would look to leverage big data and online stores to reach more shoppers.The firm's pivot into fashion is part of a wider drive by Chinese firms that also includes conglomerates Fosun (HK:0656), which could lead to an increase in fashion sector deal-making.Once a state-owned textiles firm, Ruyi was privatized two decades ago as part of a government reform. Its deal-making spree started in 2010 and has stretched from Japanese brand Renown to Hong Kong-based Trinity Group and textile brands such as Lycra.With presence in 84 countries, Ruyi's annual sales revenue has exceeded 20 billion yuan, Qiu said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

That echoes a similar message from its bigger competitor Alibaba and its Luxury Pavilion platform.As they chase labels, the firms are willing to go where the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN) will not.That includes giving them control over their image and prices - some of which, like $97,926 Tiffany (N:TIF) jewels, have reached eye-watering amounts - while offering advantageous fees compared with Western equivalents.And while some brands like Italy's independent Armani signed up early on to both sites, the platforms have since devised more elaborate deals to win over and retain others. Alibaba is developing a specific app for Chinese travellers with its most significant luxury client to date, Cartier-owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) and its Net-A-Porter online shopping portal, and it teamed up with Italy's Moncler (MI:MONC) to sell a collection of its fancy puffer jackets designed solely for Pavilion.Alibaba, behind mass market shopping sites Tmall and Taobao and YouTube equivalent Youku, has already bagged distribution or content-sharing alliances ranging from U.S. coffee behemoth Starbucks (O:SBUX) to Walt  Disney  (N:DIS).JD - which counts Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), owner of social media platform WeChat, as an investor - also has partnerships with the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL), helping it gain a foothold beyond China and Southeast Asia. In luxury, it has cracked some top brands at LVMH's rival, Paris-based conglomerate  Kering  (PA:PRTP), signing Balenciaga, known for its luxury sneakers, and fashion house Saint Laurent on to Toplife. SOLO EFFORTSVuitton, one of the market leaders in the luxury sector with annual revenues estimated at more than 9 billion euros, is fiercely protective of its distribution as a means of controlling prices and supply.That has helped Vuitton, and a handful of rivals such as Hermes , maker of $10,000-plus Birkin bags, sustain their status at the upper end of the luxury hierarchy, a high-margin sphere to which others like Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) aspire. In China, Vuitton - like Kering's Gucci or Hermes - has ventured online but on its own terms, with a WeChat store and a standalone e-commerce site launched in 2017 that it says is doing well, though it does not publish earnings. ""Everyone told me you couldn't go it alone in China, that no-one went to a 'brands.com' and I think we've proven that to be incorrect,"" Ian Rogers, who runs the digital operations at parent LVMH. ""When you have a product people really want, they're going to get it the way that's possible to get it.""Chinese customers are critical for Vuitton and its peers, already accounting for at least a third of all industry sales. Many are starting to spend more at home rather than on overseas trips, encouraged by government measures such as cuts in import duties, leading labels to lower prices accordingly.But while Vuitton has stores in 20 Chinese cities, it is relying like rivals on online sales to reach clients beyond that base. ""A third of potential buyers are in cities where there are no luxury stores. Their only access to products is e-commerce,"" said Sebastien Badault, Alibaba's managing director for France. The group says it can give luxury brands visibility and access to those areas, and also crunch data from its more than 600 million online shopping clients to help them identify pockets of demand. EDUCATION PROCESSLVMH did not comment on what it would take for Vuitton to join forces with either of the Chinese players.The two offer some subtly different services, with JD also handling inventories and storage for those who want it, or offering to ease brands' set-up within WeChat, a platform with a billion users. The sites offer to share client data and take commissions per sale, which at Alibaba's Luxury Pavilion sit at up to 5 percent, Badault said. That is in line with the broader online shopping sector in China, but lower than the 12-15 percent average on U.S. or European equivalents, he added. JD declined to give details.Other LVMH brands have already taken the plunge, including several cosmetics labels such as Benefit, which retails on Tmall. Upscale fur house Fendi has experimented with a pop-up store on JD's Toplife - a method used by the group to lure brands in. ""We're open to doing that because we know it's an education process,"" Ding said, adding that JD had constant exchanges even with the reticent brands like Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci. ""We are invited by them to give lectures, to share our findings and experience.""PEANUTSHermes has already signaled it could cave eventually - a major departure for a brand that also only sells in its own networks. Gucci has made its red lines clear, demanding more of a crackdown on fake luxury goods circulating on the likes of Tmall. JD and Alibaba will still have to persuade brands that their platforms can deliver. They aim to eventually reach a universe of 200 to 250 luxury labels, up from the 80 Toplife expects to have by year end or the 75 Pavilion now boasts. Moncler, which launched on Pavilion in late September, said in October it was happy with the project, though the impact on sales volumes was ""not yet"" material.But luxury players are also increasingly open about their struggle to break China's online market alone. ""Our business is on fire and when I look at the e-commerce that we do (in China) it's basically peanuts,"" Fabrizio Cardinali, chief operating officer at Italy's independent Dolce & Gabbana, told a Financial Times Business of Luxury conference earlier this year. ""We need to find a way to break through, and it's not just for us, it's for everybody.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Fears of a full-blown trade war, rising U.S. bond yields, slowing Chinese growth, political risk in the form of Brexit or Italy's populist government have all been blamed for last month ""red October"" during which indexes worldwide sustained some of their worst losses since the 2008 financial crisis.Markets' new found optimism is however pushing European shares up over four percent this week, their best performance since December 2016. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) jumped 1.6 percent, in what would be its biggest daily rise since July, lifted by the big exporters among its constituents, such as car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), up 4 percent. The European automotive index (SXAP) was the best performing one, jumping 3.5 percent and all other sectors were in positive territory except for a minority of defensive sectors. Both telecoms or utilities traded slightly or on the verge of negative territory. Boosted by a upgrade from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), France's  Kering  (PA:PRTP) topped the euro zone blue chip index (STOXX50E) with a 5.5 percent rise. Other luxury stocks such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) or  Burberry  (L:BRBY) did well, up 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent. Following Asia's lead, European tech stocks shrugged off Apple's (O:AAPL) disappointing results, which saw the iPhone marker's shares tumbled about seven percent after the bell.Apple supplier AMS however was down 5.3 percent and suffered the worst losses in the pan-European index. The banking sector (SX7P) was showing no angst about the results of European stress tests which will be divulged after the close.Italian lenders are under the spotlight with their heavy exposure to sovereign Italian debt, which is suffering from the populist government’s spending plans and its row with the EU's executive body.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

40,"Oct 04, 2018 09:04PM ET",Gucci boss reassures staff over looming era of slower growth,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - The head of Gucci has reassured shop staff over a looming slowdown in the pace of sales growth after a revenue explosion at the  Kering  (PA:PRTP)-owned label, according to an internal video message seen by Reuters. Italy-based Gucci - the biggest earnings driver at the French luxury conglomerate - has outperformed most of its peers since 2016 thanks to a flamboyant makeover under designer Alessandro Michele. The boom has lasted longer than many fashion analysts expected, even as rivals invest in competing brands. Marco Bizzarri, Gucci's chief executive since 2015, said in a message to store employees they should not be daunted by any sign of a slowdown or variations in daily performances, which he said would be normal after rapid growth and at a time when year-ago comparisons are growing tougher. ""I am here today to reassure you in the sense that Gucci is stronger than ever,"" Bizzarri said in the video message, adding Gucci was maintaining its competitive advantage over ""any other brand in the arena.""Kering executives had already flagged to market watchers a ""progressive normalization"" of sales growth in 2018. The nearly four-minute-long video was presented to staff in the past week following Gucci's catwalk show in Paris, which was highlighted by Bizzarri in his comments.A copy of the video was shared with Reuters by a person who had received it in the fashion industry.Kering declined to comment. ""ENJOY THE RIDE""Gucci, like its rivals, has been carried by strong demand from Chinese consumers. Comparable sales at the label increased 40.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. That was a touch below forecasts following better-than-expected 48.7 percent growth in the previous three months, but still a faster pace than rivals like LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton, a brand Gucci wants to overtake one day as it aims to increase annual sales to 10 billion euros, from 6.2 billion euros ($7.15 billion) in 2017.""We need to recognize the fact that at a certain point we're going to slow down, we cannot keep on growing 50, 60 percent per month, it's impossible,"" Bizzarri said in the video, adding that growth was still ""exceptional"" and telling staff to ""enjoy the ride"". ""I'm happier now than I was two years ago, I'm very very confident,"" Bizzarri said.Kering's shares have risen more than 20 percent this year, driven in large part by Gucci's strong performance. Its Saint Laurent and Balenciaga brands are riding high too, though Gucci accounts for over 70 percent of group profits. Gucci is investing in e-commerce and store facelifts to keep growing the brand, as well as building up areas like cosmetics and perfumes to maximize revenue from non-core products.Quirky runway styles have helped it attract younger shoppers at a time when not all luxury firms have profited from a benign industry backdrop. Yet Gucci's distinctive look could make it vulnerable to brand fatigue, analysts have said. Broader market worries about a potential slowdown in China rattled luxury stocks from LVMH to Kering and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) on Thursday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

44,"Sep 25, 2018 01:18PM ET",Michael Kors makes high-end fashion statement with $2.2 billion Versace buy,nan,"By Giulia Segreti and Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - Michael Kors (N:KORS) agreed to buy luxury designer Versace for 1.83 billion euros ($2.15 billion) including debt on Tuesday, as the U.S. fashion group positions itself to take on larger European rivals.Michael Kors, whose namesake label is best known for its leather handbags, has made no secret of its ambition to widen its customer base and its portfolio of high-end brands after buying British stiletto-heel maker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion last year.The bet on Versace comes as the U.S. group looks to refresh the more downmarket image of the Michael Kors brand and recover some of its pricing power. The move is also aimed at reviving Versace, which returned to a net profit last year.It is the latest in a string of foreign takeovers of Italian luxury brands in recent years.Milan-based Versace, known for its bold designs and its Medusa head logo, was one of a clutch of family-owned Italian brands cited as attractive targets at a time when the luxury industry is riding high on strong demand from China. ""With the acquisition of Versace we have created one of the world's leading fashion and luxury groups,"" said John Idol, chairman and CEO of  Michael Kors Holdings .Michael Kors has agreed to buy all of Versace's outstanding shares for a total enterprise value of 1.83 billion euros ($2.2 billion) to be funded in cash, debt and shares in Michael Kors Holding Ltd, which will be renamed Capri Holdings Ltd.Idol later ruled out any further acquisitions by Capri, which will focus on developing the three brands. Talks started before the summer, when Versace was on the radar of several investors, as Blackstone (NYSE:BX) intended to exit the group, a source close to the deal said. The U.S. private equity firm, which bought 20 percent of Versace for 210 million euros in 2014, will make a 156 million euro capital gain by exiting its investment, Reuters calculations show. The Versace family, which owns 80 percent of the Milan-based fashion house, will receive 150 million euros of the purchase price in Capri shares.""We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace's long-term success. My passion has never been stronger,"" said Donatella Versace, the sister of its late founder who is its artistic director and vice-president.Versace CEO Jonathan Akeroyd will remain at the helm of the company, while Donatella Versace will ""continue to lead the company's creative vision"", Idol added. The deal is expected to close in the fourth fiscal quarter, subject to regulatory approvals. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were among the advisers. BIG FASHIONBudding conglomerates like Michael Kors have been trying to make inroads into an industry dominated by European players such as Louis Vuitton-owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP).""The Versace brand has strong global growth potential which is untapped across all regions, particularly Asia and North America,"" Cowen analysts said in a note. Idol said his group plans to grow Versace's global sales to $2 billion globally, reach profit margins in the ""high teens range"" and open about 100 new stores as well as bolstering online sales. It also plans to raise the share of higher-margin accessories and footwear to 60 percent of sales from 35 percent. ""Versace is terribly under-developed. That is going to change with the resources of Capri behind them,"" Idol added, in a call with analysts, explaining that the group's runway line would remain the main ""focus"". He admitted that the brand's reach was bigger than its customer base and that ""we need to convert those metrics"".Versace does not disclose financial details, but filed documents showing 2017 sales were 668 million euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 45 million euros.""(In luxury) Americans are the opposite of Italians: Though not excellent in products, they are (excellent) in their approach to the market. The only risk is that they don't give the product their due value,"" said Giuliano Noci, professor at Milan's Politecnico School of Management. Michael Kors shares were trading 1.4 percent higher at 1655 GMT, after falling more than 8 percent on Monday when news of the deal emerged. Versace is the latest Made-in-Italy name to be snapped up by a foreign company. Rome-based Fendi, celebrity jeweler Bulgari and cashmere maker Loro Piana were all bought by LVMH. Gucci is the biggest brand in Kering, which also Bottega Veneta and menswear brand Brioni.Fans fretted on social media about the red carpet favorite losing its appeal, while Italian politicians mourned the loss of another of the country's cherished brands. ""I am a liberal but I'm tired of seeing the best Italian brands in fashion, food and technology being bought by foreigners,"" Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said.

""Would Michael Kors have what it takes to succeed in this? I wonder. The plan seems ambitious.""Shares in Michael Kors fell in early U.S. trade and were down 8.7 percent by 1526 GMT.The move is in line with the U.S. brand's ambition to aggregate various luxury brands - including fashion, shoes and accessories - under one larger group. The deal - which is expected to be announced imminently - will give Michael Kors a mega-brand and red carpet favorite that is among the most recognizable and followed fashion labels in the world. Two of the three sources who spoke to Reuters said the company had agreed to pay a large premium for Versace.Michael Kors could not be reached for comment. Versace declined to comment.Donatella Versace, sister of late founder Gianni who doubles as artistic director and vice-president of the Milan-based group, has called a staff meeting for Tuesday, according to a person who was briefed by a company employee. The Italian fashion icon has been considering a market listing after U.S. private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) bought a 20 percent stake in 2014 to fund overseas expansion, although Chief Executive Jonathan Akeroyd told Reuters earlier this year there was no rush for an IPO.After investing in Versace at a high multiple, Blackstone found its performance insufficient to justify a market listing, said one of the sources, who is close to the family. ""They gradually persuaded the family to look into a possible sale and introduced them to a series of buyers, including Michael Kors,"" the person added. ""Blackstone wasn't going to put any more money into it. They needed a buyer who could make heavy investments.""""OVERPRICED"" French fashion houses including Paris-based  Kering  (PA:PRTP) were among those holding talks with the Versace family, the sources said, but considered the price too expensive.""They didn't feel the need to invest so much money into another Italian fashion brand. It was overpriced,"" the source said. Kering declined to comment.As part of the deal, Blackstone will fully exit Versace, while the family, which owns the rest of the fashion house via a holding company called Givi, will keep a role, the sources said.Givi in turn is half-owned by Allegra Versace Beck, daughter of Donatella and niece of late founder Gianni. Donatella herself owns 30 percent of the holding, with the remainder in the hands of her brother Santo.Blackstone, whose stake acquisition valued Versace at $1.4 billion in 2014, declined to comment.Versace does not disclose its financial details, but documents deposited with the Italian chamber of commerce show that last year it posted sales of 668 million euros ($786 million) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and appreciation (EBITDA) of 44.6 million euros.Since Akeroyd's appointment in 2016, Versace has been working on streamlining its management structure, cutting costs and pushing to increase sales online. Last year it returned to a net profit of just under 15 million euros compared with a net loss of 7.9 million euros the previous year. ($1 = 0.8499 euros)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

47,"Sep 21, 2018 02:36PM ET",Farfetch tops price range in IPO in boon to luxury market,nan,"By Sarah White and Melissa FaresPARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Farfetch (N:FTCH) priced its shares above its targeted range on Friday in a New York flotation that values the online luxury retailer at over $5.8 billion and underscores how big a bet web sales have become for high-end brands.E-commerce is emerging as one of the biggest growth drivers for luxury labels initially fearful of diluting their image by selling online. London-based Farfetch - a 10-year-old site that connects shoppers to hundreds of boutiques and fashion labels but carries no inventory - is one of a clutch of rapidly-expanding multi-brand platforms that got an early foothold in the market.The company's shares were trading as much as 39 percent above its initial public offering at $20 per share on the New York stock exchange on Friday - surpassing the range of $17 to $19 that already had been increased. It will raise $885 million in the listing, with the company issuing 33.6 million new shares and existing shareholders, including early backers such as Advent Venture Partners and Vitrurian Partners, selling 10.6 million. The IPO values Farfetch, founded by Portuguese entrepreneur Jose Neves, at $5.8 billion according to the share count available in its latest filings. When including employee share options this would rise to $6.3 billion, the company said. Existing Farfetch investors include JD.com (O:JD), China's second largest e-commerce firm, which bought extra shares along the listing in a private placement. The flotation comes at a time of growing competition among independent online fashion retailers and luxury groups rolling out their e-commerce operations, including cash-rich luxury heavyweights like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), which is experimenting with its own multi-brand site.  Richemont  (S:CFR), the Swiss conglomerate that owns jeweler Cartier, this year took control of now delisted Farfetch rival Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter, in a deal that valued that platform at 5.3 billion euros ($6.2 billion). Farfetch - which has never turned a profit, but posted a 59 percent jump in revenues last year to $386 million - drew investment from prominent industry players in its IPO, like the Pinault family that controls  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the French group behind brands such as Italy's Gucci. To stand out from the crowd, the platform is investing heavily in technology, including for digital store services it is trialing with France's Chanel, one of Farfetch's big name tie-ups. ""It is an industry that, rightly so, chooses their path and their channels very carefully,"" said Farfetch Chief Executive Jose Neves, adding that, for most luxury retailers, it is all about brand image, aesthetic and high-end customer service.""But I think the industry has seen the potential of reaching key demographics like the new millennial customer that thinks digital first. These customers are online - they’re not offline.""Online sales are set to make up a quarter of the luxury industry's revenues by 2025 from just under 10 percent now, according to consultancy Bain, thanks in part to demand from young shoppers in tech-savvy markets like China.($1 = 0.8493 euros)""That is an incremental $100 billion opportunity just in online luxury fashion,"" Neves said. ""This is Chapter 2. We want to be a category leader and we want to continue to gain massive share in this space,"" Neves said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Founded in 1948, Longchamp, best known for its folding Pliage handbags, is one of the last remaining independent family-owned leather goods makers in France with a global presence. At a time when some top-of-the-range luxury brands, such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton and Hermes (PA:HRMS), are riding high on strong demand from China, others are having to refresh their designs or marketing strategies to keep young shoppers in particular hooked. Longchamp, which does not publish its earnings, saw sales grow at a ""less vigorous"" pace in 2016 and 2017, having tripled in the decade before, Chief Executive Jean Cassegrain, grandson of the firm's founder, said in an interview. The company - whose top market is French, followed closely by China - took a hit as tourist numbers in France fell following deadly Islamist militant attacks in 2015. But by next year, Cassegrain said Longchamp aims to outperform growth in the broader luxury industry, which according to consultancy Bain, should rise 6 to 8 percent globally.The firm had said it made sales of 560 million euros ($658.11 million) in 2015, and they are estimated by industry watchers to still be in a 500 million to 600 million range.Longchamp, which sells its bags and accessories in China through Tencent's (HK:0700) messaging site WeChat, plans to launch its own e-commerce platform there in 2019 to increase sales, following similar moves by rivals LVMH and Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci. The handbag maker has largely finished expanding its worldwide store network, with 1,500 sale points in department stores and 300 of its own shops, although it plans to open a few more in the United States, including one in Beverley Hills.""We're entering a different phase of growth, it's no longer about store openings but about improving the performance of our current network,"" Cassegrain said. Longchamp, which manufactures about half its bags in France with the rest in countries including Tunisia and Romania, recently marked its 70th anniversary with its first fashion show in New York and picked celebrity model Kendall Jenner as the face of its campaigns to raises its U.S. profile.

56,"Aug 19, 2018 07:10PM ET","Global luxury brands again chase China's young, rich and spendthrift",nan,"By Farah Master and Donny KwokHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global luxury brands from Prada (HK:1913) to LVMH (PA:LVMH) are investing in China for the first time since a crackdown on conspicuous spending five years ago, focusing on smaller, less developed cities even as the world's second-largest economy slows.Increasing spend by cash-rich Chinese millennials, largely unhindered by a crackdown on corruption and extravagant spending, is prompting brands to revamp some stores and open new ones in second- and third-tier cities where luxury spending is growing faster.The youngsters, who account for around 30 percent of the sector's China sales, are a demographic less sensitive to wider economic factors, executives said.""There is the emergence in China of a very strong upper class or upper middle class,"" Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and CEO of cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) said on a call with analysts.""And the difference is that now millennials from this middle and middle upper class are absolutely not hesitant to buy luxury brands.""Often single children armed with family money, the 20-34 year-old demographic started buying luxury brands at a young age and purchases more frequently, splurging on everything from jewelry and fashion, to cosmetics and handbags, industry experts say.Many millennials are also choosing to remain in the country's outlying provinces, shunning more expensive, larger cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, thanks to rapid industrialization and urbanization. ""Where the spend is? It is the post-90s, the young generation - definitely a young generation that spends money on luxury,"" said Shanghai-based Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey & Co.Revenue growth in China's luxury segment was around 15-20 percent for the first half of the year, Zipser added. TRADE WAR JITTERSChinese luxury shoppers account for over $500 billion yuan ($73 billion) in annual spending, representing almost a third of the global luxury market, McKinsey said in its latest report. Brands including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and French luxury handbag maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) all reported resilient appetite from Chinese shoppers in the second quarter even as escalating China-U.S. trade tensions cast a pall over the broader economy.The share of luxury purchases made in China is rapidly increasing, several executives said, spurred by price cuts from top brands after authorities reduced import duties on some goods and made it harder to buy products from overseas websites and vendors. A strong euro at the start of 2018 also put off tourists from spending in Europe, executives said.Prices of luxury goods in China, previously significantly higher than in Europe and the United States, have been gradually falling. Taxes have also been lowered by 7-17 percent, allowing firms to cut prices. Italian luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC) has reduced its prices in China by 3.5 percent on average since July, while Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermes have also cut prices. ""When I compare it with the United States the price difference between brands is not that large,"" said Sunny Deng, 28, who studies in America but was on holiday in Shanghai. ""Sometimes it's even cheaper here.""SMALLER CITY PUSHTo capture the rapidly growing millennial market, global names are increasingly moving further afield from China's first-tier cities - the previous engines of growth.Prada, which reported strong half-year earnings bolstered by Chinese consumers, opened seven stores this year in Xi'an, home of China's Terracotta Army in the northwest. Three were for the Prada label, two for its Miu Miu brand and two for Church's.LVMH opened a store in the sprawling central city of Wuhan, home to 11 million people, while jewelry brand Chaumet opened a store in the city of Wuxi, outside Shanghai. Hermes is launching a store in Xi'an in September.Even so, luxury firms are wary of demand softening in the second half of the year as a trade row between China and the United States escalates.""It would be unwise not to make some allowances for the uncertain political and macroenvironment,"" Jean-Francois Palus,  Kering  group managing director, said in July. LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony, on a call with analysts in July, also warned of potential risks from increased global tariffs.""Although the luxury industry is not in the front line on this, such a risk would certainly bare some negative consequences for us,"" he said.Brands have also been putting increasing emphasis on their digital offerings to court China's online shoppers.Louis Vuitton and Gucci both launched Chinese e-commerce sites last year and Hermes plans to roll out its site in China later this year.Louis Vuitton has also teamed up with China's Baidu to use facial recognition to support its first fragrance campaign in the country.Zipser said Chinese households were ramping up spending thanks to a younger generation who enjoyed buying luxury. McKinsey expects incremental spend from existing Chinese customers to account for 60 percent of the next 10 years of growth. ""It is all the extra spend per person increasing on that. In the past, it was primarily more people. Now it is more people plus more spend of existing people,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

60,"Aug 10, 2018 04:45AM ET",Trade war threatens reign of luxury stocks,nan,"By Helen Reid and Sarah WhiteLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - An escalating trade war between the United States and China could abruptly end a glittering stock market run for luxury goods firms, with some investors already put off by lofty valuations in a sector powered by shoppers in the two countries. From pricey handbags to designer shoes, booming sales at the European companies that dominate the industry like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have made them investor favorites, with shares still near record highs. But the possible trickle down effect of tit-for-tat tariffs hikes on consumers is adding to jitters over heady valuations, even though luxury firms are not as directly threatened by rising protectionism as carmakers and industrial companies.The sector has an average valuation of 21 times 12-month earnings forecasts, according to Reuters data, down from its May peak, but still 23 percent above its 10-year average. ""We are not making a call that they are bad companies, we think they're great companies. But they're bad investments,"" said Edinburgh-based David Keir, co-manager of the Saracen Global Income and Growth fund, which dropped its LVMH holdings last year and sold out of German suit maker  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) in early July. ""Now there's an incremental risk from the great unknown of trade tariffs as well.""It would not be the first demand-driven wobble the luxury industry has faced. In 2012, a Chinese crackdown on corruption caused purchases of premium cognac and other high-end goods used as gifts to fall sharply, taking the likes of LVMH and Remy Cointreau shares down with them. This time, tariffs threaten consumers' spending power in both the United States and China – the world's two biggest consumers of European luxury goods, which make up just over half the industry's revenues. The impact on confidence in China's markets, including the depreciation of the renminbi that would eat into Chinese tourists' budgets for shopping in Europe, is among risks that may not be fully reflected in stocks yet, analysts warn. ""We see very little priced in so far,"" said UBS analysts, who forecast as much as a 30 percent share price drop in the sector index in the event of a fully-fledged trade war.Among the stocks that would be worse affected, UBS included Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY). The two brands are in the midst of turnaround plans that have yet to fully hit their stride. For a related graphic, click https://reut.rs/2MxNtB9CHINA THRIVINGSo far, the knock-on effect on revenues has been muted. If anything, Chinese demand for Louis Vuitton's leather goods ticked up in the second quarter compared to the first, LVMH reported, while most firms argue their core clientele is here to stay. ""We have still an expansion of the middle and upper class in China,"" Kering's group managing director Jean-Francois Palus told analysts following the company's half-year results. Sales in China have been largely driven by a young clientele unafraid of splurging on branded goods, and often financed by their parents and grandparents, with rising property prices also providing a source of wealth.Even a moderate slowdown in the pace of revenue growth, as is expected regardless of the trade spat after two years of rebounding demand in China, is not enough to spook some drawn to the sector's underlying strengths. ""Demand is really healthy,"" said Andrea Gerst, co-portfolio manager of GAM's Luxury brands fund, which has stakes in many major European labels. ""If comparatives get more difficult, then the absolute madness may not be as strong, but there'll still be healthy growth.""More broadly, global luxury sales are driven by some of the world's wealthiest shoppers who might shrug off any direct impact from tariffs were it to come to that. ""With luxury you've got people who are far less price-sensitive as your customers and so you ask yourself if there's a tax put on and the price goes up a bit, how much is that really going to change the demand?"" said Fergus Shaw, partner and portfolio manager at Cerno Capital.Shaw said his fund owns LVMH shares, and he has not been tempted to sell out, expecting any impact from tariffs to be much smaller than the anti-corruption drive was. For a related graphic, click https://reut.rs/2MxI3WwNERVESYet market nerves around the sector are becoming more evident, and luxury companies and industry lobbies are on alert. Even good or in-line results from luxury companies for the second quarter prompted some sharp sell-offs on results day.Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded the luxury sector at the start of July to ""underweight"", citing trade war worries. Italy's Confindustria Moda, the national association of textile and fashion companies, said its entrepreneurs feared a possible rise in tariffs and that it was monitoring the situation in the hope of avoiding ""a protectionist escalation"".It estimates goods in the sector are already subject on average to 12 percent trade tariffs, and are unlikely to be targeted for increases, however. Though the bulk of luxury manufacturing is still anchored in Europe, some firms are also weighing whether to make changes to their supply chains should they get caught in the crossfire. ""This is an industry in which we have the capability, as we do and as we have done in the past, to switch capacity from one location to the other as is necessary,"" Ray-Ban maker Luxottica's (MI:LUX) finance chief Stefano Grassi told analysts following second-quarter results. The Italian group, which makes designer sunglasses for Chanel and Versace among other labels, could for example shift more production to the United States if needed, where it has a factory. It also has three in China, while the majority of its plants are in its home base.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

61,"Aug 09, 2018 08:20AM ET",L'Oreal adds to Facebook sales push with virtual make-up tests,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Maybelline parent L'Oreal (PA:OREP) is pairing up with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to roll out virtual tests for shoppers to see how they might look with different lipsticks or eye shadows, adding to its push to drive more sales online and through social media networks. Cosmetics firms including L'Oreal rival  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) and retailers like LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Sephora are investing heavily in technology, in an age of selfies and beauty bloggers that has helped shift the industry onto the web. France's L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics group, bought Canadian augmented reality and artificial intelligence specialist ModiFace in March. It said on Thursday that the Toronto-based company had now teamed up with Facebook to develop augmented reality experiences on the platform for L'Oreal brands, starting with NYX and including Urban Decay, Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent. Customers will eventually be able to try on anything from foundation shades to eyebrow shapes and hues, said L'Oreal's chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet, adding that the virtual tests helped the company clinch sales.""What we've seen on our sites is that when there is a virtual test facility, conversion rates increase significantly,"" said Rochet. Social media networks had become the biggest growth driver of web sales for L'Oreal in terms of attracting shopping traffic, though purchases are redirected to take place on brands' own sites or third party online retailers, Rochet added.The French company said e-commerce revenues reached 9.5 percent of all its sales in the first half of 2018, up from close to 5 percent three years ago. The virtual testing technology should eventually be rolled out on Facebook's photo-sharing networking site Instagram, Rochet said. In China, where Facebook is blocked, Rochet said L'Oreal was also talking to other partners about similar deals, without naming them. Luxury goods groups in China do a lot of business through Tencent (HK:0700)'s messaging and networking site WeChat. Facebook said it had begun testing augmented reality in advertising as of July, with Sephora and brands like fashion group Michael Kors (N:KORS).  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

68,"Jul 10, 2018 02:32AM ET",Old fashion: Vintage boom buoys RealReal and jolts luxury labels,nan,"By Sarah White and Melissa FaresPARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Second-hand fashion, once confined to thrift stores, is outstripping sales growth in the primary luxury goods sector, helping market leader The RealReal expand its business and prompting international labels to look at tie-ups.Sales of second-hand, or vintage, luxury goods - from Chanel handbags and Gucci dresses to Rolex watches - are thriving on dedicated web platforms that are drawing a younger clientele seeking bargains and championing recycling.The RealReal could be ready to list on the stock market within two years, when it expects the value of goods sold on the site to have roughly doubled to $1 billion annually, its founder and CEO told Reuters.The seven-year-old U.S. company is also in talks with high-end brands like Louis Vuitton parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) over potential partnerships, Julie Wainwright said. Luxury labels have hitherto shunned the second-hand trade, fearing diluting their exclusivity and cannibalizing their sales. But they are now finding it hard to ignore a second-hand luxury business that is worth $25 billion in annual revenue and is expected to grow by up to 10 percent annually in coming years, according to Berenberg analysts. That is more than twice the projected pace of growth of the much larger primary market.While there are few indications so far that they are planning in-house ventures, brands including LVMH and Kering are now talking to vintage sites as they try to figure out how they might extract some value from the burgeoning sector, The RealReal and executives from other resellers said. LVMH did not return requests to comment. Kering has said it is ""testing things with The RealReal"", without elaborating. FRIEND OR FOE TO BRANDS?Second-hand platforms make their money by taking a cut of the resale price of an item, anything from 10 percent to 50 percent depending on the product and how much the seller has sold via the site.The RealReal is facing growing competition from rival resellers looking to cash in on the booming market, including thredUP, which branched into luxury last year, and established players like Vestiaire Collective. For The RealReal and its rivals, partnerships with big brands could raise their profile and give them an edge. They declined to disclose details about the tie-ups they were discussing. But some executives, including Vestiaire CEO Sebastien Fabre, said deals could include data-sharing that allow brands to track what kind of people were buying and selling their products, and how items' value was holding. Such information could inform their marketing campaigns and pricing.The RealReal's existing partnership with British label Stella McCartney could also serve as a model. The brand actively encourages shoppers to recycle its clothes by offering $100 vouchers, half paid for by The RealReal, to spend on new products in stores for every old Stella McCartney item they sell on the site. Resale platforms are betting most luxury firms will prefer to opt for strategic alliances rather than to go it alone, in part because the logistics of second-hand sales can be daunting. Resellers said labels were also increasingly convinced by their argument that rather than threaten luxury sales, they may help funnel money back to brands. The RealReal's Wainwright said about a fifth of the money that sellers made was spent on buying items on the site, suggesting a significant proportion might go back into the broader apparel market. ""I think we're past the point where they may have felt we were a threat,"" she said. ""For many millennials it's their first-time experience with a luxury brand on our site.""'I ALSO SHOP AT PRADA'The RealReal has a 100-strong team of anti-counterfeiters to weed out fakes, and processes between 200,000 to 300,000 products a month. Vestiaire, which also works with authenticators, adds 6,000 new products a day to its site, after 30 percent of all items submitted for resale are rejected. Prices and discounts vary considerably, with determining factors including the condition of the item and how in demand a brand if at that moment.For example, shoppers on The RealReal can buy a 2015 black lace top from Givenchy for 1210 euros ($1,416), around a third of the original price, while polka-dotted Balenciaga high heels from last year were down to 374 euros from around 876 euros.Yet some things hold their value or even fetch premiums second-hand. A maroon Hermes Birkin bag made of ostrich leather from 2009 is on the RealReal at 21,130 euros when its 2017 retail price as a new product was around 15,000 euros.In New York's Soho district, Chinese student Fan Tu shopped for pre-owned items from Prada (HK:1913) and LVMH label Celine at The RealReal's store - its first, with a second due to open in Los Angeles in August. Tu, who had raised about $4,500 from selling used clothes via The RealReal this year, said she was not just after bargains - rather anything that caught her eye from her favorite labels, new or old. ""I also shop at Celine, right across the street, and at Prada, two blocks away,"" she said, clutching a pair of her old Chanel boots and Dolce & Gabbana loafers destined for resale.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

69,"Jul 09, 2018 02:20AM ET",The Foxconns of fast beauty propel South Korean cosmetics' success in China,nan,"By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo JinSEOUL (Reuters) - At a factory two hours south of Seoul, women clad in plastic caps and masks put peach-colored eye-shadow into cases, right next to a machine churning out a skin-color face powder.The difference between the two lines: the first is supplying one of France’s best-known premium cosmetic brands, while the second is serving a South Korean budget firm.The plant is operated by Cosmecca Korea (KQ:241710), the country's third-biggest contract cosmetics maker, which produces a range of products for more than 300 customers, all the way from high-end brands like  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) to nimble domestic firms such as Clio and Dr.Jart.It is factories like this that have made South Korea the epicenter of fast beauty, a world in which the time it takes to get a product idea onto store shelves has dropped dramatically, often by years. This is vital as fickle millennial consumers can easily leave last year's hits as this year's busts.Their dominance of the world of contract manufacturing for cosmetics may have become as important to the industry as Apple (O:AAPL) iPhone manufacturer Foxconn (TW:2354) has been for electronics.Some of the major Korean brands they work for have been acquired by global cosmetics companies such as L’Oreal (PA:OREP) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR), and according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, the manufacturers themselves have received investment offers, some from foreign cosmetics firms.South Korea's three largest contract manufacturers - Cosmax (KS:192820),  Korea Kolmar  (KS:161890) and Cosmecca - have all been approached by foreign investors about buying a minority stake in recent years, three people with direct knowledge of the situations told Reuters. The sources asked for anonymity and declined to elaborate further citing confidentiality of the approaches. One of the sources said one of the manufacturers had rejected a 2016 offer from an overseas cosmetics company for a minority stake, partly due to concerns that such an alliance could upset its broader customer base.Representatives for the companies declined to comment. DEMAND FROM CHINESE BRANDSThough largely staying in the background with little public recognition themselves, contract manufacturers stand to benefit as Korean brands they work for rapidly grow in China's $53.5billion cosmetics market. That's thanks to their value for money image, fast turnaround times for new products, and smart online marketing. China's own fast-growing cosmetics brands, albeit still small, are also driving the revenue growth of South Korean manufacturers, although margins on these contracts can be low, company officials say.The stock market performance of the three has been mixed, though they have all outperformed the main benchmark in South Korea. Shares of global No.1 Cosmax (KS:192820), has gained 34percent year to date, far outpacing a 8 percent drop in the wider South Korean market (KS11). Cosmecca shares rose 8 percent and second-ranked Korea Kolmar (KS:161890) fell 3 percent in the same period. All three have, though, outperformed the 21 percent decline in shares of Amorepacific Group (KS:002790), South Korea's largest cosmetics powerhouse. Amorepacific, which uses both in-house and contract manufacturing, reported revenue fell 10 percent and operating profit slumped by nearly 30 percent in the first three months of2018. Its brands include the top-end Sulwhasoo, mass market Innisfree, and young makeup offering Etude House.Even as all the top three contract firms, which are also known as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), posted revenue growth in the same period.""The surge of smaller players gives tough times to beauty giants like Amorepacific. By contrast, this is a favorable environment for OEMs,"" said Park Jong-dae, an analyst at HanaInvestment & Securities. ""While brand companies have up and downs, OEMs garner stable earnings. They are most suited to the industry's structural changes - Asian growth and diversified distribution channels."" STRUGGLING TO CATCH-UP In particular, they are central to the success in the high-growth China market of small Korean brands with new ideas but no production or research capabilities, industry executives and experts say. When French luxury giant LVMH's (PA:LVMH) private equity arm was conducting due diligence on Clio before buying a stake in2016, among its key questions was: ""How do you come up with new products at such a fast speed?,"" said Lim Mira, a manager atClio's strategic planning team. Contract manufacturers such as Cosmax deliver on orders much more quickly, in as fast as three months compared to about a year overseas contract manufacturers require, Lim said. The firm used to source products from an Italian contract manufacturer in the past, but has now shifted to Korean manufacturers, she said. ""Many global players are struggling to catch up as the life cycle of any success has shortened, pushing them to come up with new innovations at a much faster speed,"" said Laura Chu, a China-based account director at researcher Kantar International. In China, Unilever's share declined from 3.2 percent in 2014to 2.8 percent in 2017, while L'Oreal's share fell from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent during the same period, according to research firm Euromonitor. Seeking to turn the tables, both Unilever and L'Oreal, as well as other European and American majors, have paid big premiums in the last two years to scoop up South Korean brands thriving in China. Unilever announced a 2.27 billion euro ($2.67 billion) deal for Carver Korea in September - maker of the A.H.C. cosmetics brand, whose China sales rose more than 30 percent in 2017,according to Kantar International. ""Geographically it will enable us to strength our position in two of the top five largest skin care markets - China and Korea,"" Lizzy Chen, a U.K.-based executive at Unilever, told Reuters. South Korea-based Nanda, which was acquired by L'Oreal for an undisclosed sum in May, saw sales of its flagship cosmetics brand 3CE double in China last year. The strong performance was particularly notable given that last year a major spat between Seoul and Beijing over South Korea’s installation of a new U.S. missile defense system led to an unofficial boycott of South Korean brands in China. South Korean contract manufacturers have been expanding China production to meet surging demand.Cosmecca's chairman Cho Im-rae said that in recent years it has been running its factories in China at full throttle. It is planning to open a third factory there. ""China's cosmetics demand is growing enormously,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The company, which was based out of New York, will cease operations in the United States and already shut down its one store there in May, a source close to the firm said, confirming a report by website Business of Fashion.Edun also sold its wares online and through 15 other outlets, although the current collection produced for spring and summer will be its last, while the label decides how to take the business forward, the source added. Edun, headquartered in Ireland for financial matters, had been in the red for several years, filings with the Irish companies registry showed. It made a $6.3 million loss in 2016, according to the latest available accounts, with accumulated losses reaching $80.6 million. The business is a very small part of the LVMH portfolio, which includes multi-billion euro brands such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior and also drinks companies such as champagne maker Moet & Chandon. But LVMH's 2009 investment - for an undisclosed sum - underscored a move by big luxury groups toward promoting more sustainable fashion, an area they have since been building up. Edun, launched in 2004, works with weavers and clothing workshops in Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa to help promote fair trade, and aims to source materials in an eco-friendly way, using recycled fabrics for instance.The company is financed by shareholder loans, according to its filings for the 2016 financial year, which showed its net liabilities stood at $57 million. Shareholders had agreed to not seek repayment of their loans ""for the foreseeable future"", according to the documents. Irish singer Bono, the lead singer of rock band U2 whose real name is Paul Hewson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Unlike large pharmacy chains such as CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Duane Reade in the United States or Boots in Britain, French pharmacies stock only medicines and a limited range of personal products and often have restricted opening hours.The ""drugstore"" outlets' longer opening hours are aimed at reflecting changing, modern lifestyles. A spokeswoman for Casino said a third ""drugstore"" could open in Paris if the first two did well, and that Casino and L'Oreal might expand the concept abroad. The companies did not give any financial details or targets for the ""drugstores"".Department stores in the French capital are also seeking to give consumers a more interesting shopping experience to lure them away from buying goods online.In January, Le Printemps opened a food hall on the 7th and 8th floors of its Haussmann building dedicated to men's fashion and luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) opened a second upmarket La Grande Epicerie store in Paris's posh 16th district last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Germany's DAX (GDAXI), home to some of the carmakers that Trump has explicitly targeted in his tariffs rhetoric, fell the most, down 1.2 percent. BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) dropped 0.8 to 2.4 percent. The STOXX 600 autos sector (SXAP) hit a seven-month low.""The automotive sector is one of the main sectors that could potentially be impacted by import tariffs,"" said Weidenbach, adding that the impact on different German carmakers may depend on how much of their production is U.S.-based.Europe's companies in general are more exposed to the global economy than their U.S. counterparts, making them more vulnerable to countries imposing higher tariffs on goods. Some 18 percent of European company revenues comes from North America and 9 percent from China. Thirty-two percent is derived from emerging markets.U.S. companies get just 4 percent of their revenues from China and 10 percent from Europe, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).Multinational sportswear company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) fell 2.5 percent, as the fear of an end to unfettered access to global markets also bruised luxury stocks  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes (PA:HRMS), LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Moncler (MI:MONC).Industrial conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) was one of the biggest drags on the STOXX, along with French planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR). Mining shares (SXPP) tumbled 2.4 percent, tracking a decline in London copper prices amid the escalating trade tensions.Highly valued tech stocks were also selling off as investors shed the sectors that have led the strong equity rally. The tech sector (SX8P) fell 1.4 percent, having hit a 17-year high as recently as Friday.The most impressive falls were in the UK retail and housing sectors.  Debenhams  (L:DEB) shares plummeted 10 percent after the British department store warned on profits for the third time in six months, blaming its poor trading on increased competitor discounting and weakness in its key markets.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

74,"Jun 09, 2018 03:52PM ET","With sales boom in mind, Gucci tightens grip on suppliers",nan,"By Sarah WhiteFLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - Kering's (PA:PRTP) fashion powerhouse Gucci is bringing more manufacturing in-house, as luxury firms step up efforts to meet rampant demand from Chinese shoppers with slicker operations. Gucci, which said this week it could one day overtake LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton as the world's top luxury brand by sales, also outlined plans at its strategy update to almost halve its reliance on independent leather goods suppliers. The step comes as labels including Britain's  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and France's Vuitton begin to levy greater control over their production or invest in speeding up internal processes to ride a rebound in luxury goods sales.Gucci, one of the fastest-growing fashion brands in 2017 following a flamboyant design makeover, plans to cut its use of independent suppliers to 40 percent of its leather goods production over the long term, from 75 percent now. The Italian brand aims to halve the turnaround time between a product's conception and delivery in store as a result, CEO Marco Bizzarri said, as well as secure the production capacity it needs to match its punchy sales ambitions. ""We want to reduce the lead time, and it's not possible if you're too scattered with small suppliers,"" Bizzarri told reporters, speaking at Gucci's new ""ArtLab"" site outside Florence, where it will do prototypes of bag and shoe designs. ""We also need to make sure other brands are not stealing supply. Because of the growth that we're having we need to protect our artisans,"" Bizzarri added. Italian brands have traditionally worked with an external network of dozens of local artisans on items such as handbags, when French peers Hermes  and Vuitton almost exclusively use their own workshops. Gucci has bought out 10 local suppliers and said it was closing in on another 10, though the shift to what the brand considers internal production will for the most part involve creating joint ventures with external workshops or giving them exclusive contracts.FAMILY WORKSHOPSEven that can help to stabilize production, however, when some manufacturers in Italy are vulnerable.Some are ""tiny, almost family-like workshops which have know-how but where there are often questions over whether they are sustainable, or regarding succession,"" said Olivier Salomon, managing director at consultancy Alix Partners in Paris.Other brands with a big focus on leather goods like Milan-based Prada (HK:1913) are grappling with these issues too as they also consider taking more production in-house, partly to help nurture new generations of skilled workers. ""One of the problems with outsourcing is one of quality. You need artisans ... and the problem with craftsmanship is one of training, you can't find these kind of people everywhere,"" Prada Chairman Carlo Mazzi told Reuters, as the label inaugurated a new industrial site in eastern Tuscany on Friday.While traditional skills are in demand, fashion brands are also seeking to build-up internal expertise at a time of radical innovations in the materials used in fashion. Gucci's Bizzarri cited leather grown in laboratories as one potential industry game-changer, albeit a far-off one. Part of Gucci's ArtLab remit is research and development, as the brand seeks to perfect production methods new and old.At the site on Thursday, workers buffed python skins dyed orange and blue for use in samples; elsewhere, a robot stress-tested sneakers, rhythmically bending them back and forth. ""If you internalise production you are able to experiment much more in terms of innovation,"" Bizzarri said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

75,"Jun 08, 2018 01:11PM ET",Italy's luxury brand Prada paves way for family succession: CEO,nan,"VALVIGNA, Italy (Reuters) - Prada (HK:1913) Chief Executive Patrizio Bertelli said on Friday his family would not sell its 80 percent stake in Italy's biggest luxury goods group and said his son Lorenzo may one day head the company.The Milan-based firm is run by the husband-and-wife team of Patrizio Bertelli and designer Miuccia Prada, whose grandfather founded the label in 1913. The couple's eldest child Lorenzo, 30, joined Prada to run its digital communications last year, the company confirmed this week following a Bloomberg report. Bertelli said his son was being prepared to take over. ""Lorenzo is getting ready to become one day - if he wants to - the head of Prada,"" Bertelli said, at the inauguration of a production site in Italy, although 72-year-old also said it was ""too early to retire.""The succession question comes as Prada looks to cement early signs of a turnaround following several years of falling sales. Chinese consumer demand rebounded in the past 18 months, fuelling rapid growth for some rivals like Kering's Gucci (PA:PRTP) or LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton, but Prada was slow to catch on to trends such as the rise of high-end streetwear like sneakers. It is also playing catch up with online sales, and trying to build a bigger digital presence by forging ties with influential fashion bloggers, especially in China. Sales trends improved in the second half of 2017.Other famed Italian fashion houses such as Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) are also in the midst of a turnaround, as some brands struggle more than others to grab younger shoppers' attention with new products and eye-catching looks. That has sparked speculation that names like Prada or Ferragamo could become takeover targets, though both are tightly controlled by families seen as unlikely to let go easily.""We're not selling, we'll never sell,"" Prada's Bertelli said, adding that there were no acquisitions in sight either because of ""really crazy"" prices.The luxury industry's biggest, cash-rich players - French conglomerates  Kering  and LVMH - have succeeded in picking up some Italian family brands in recent years, however. LVMH grabbed jeweler Bulgari in 2011, while Kering bought into smaller Italian jewelry brand Pomellato in 2013.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

80,"Jun 07, 2018 04:18AM ET",Southeast Europe targets luxury brands' fast fashion catchup,nan,"By Tsvetelia Tsolova and Michael KahnROUSSE, Bulgaria/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Miglena Hristova's factory near the Danube is among a growing number in southeastern Europe positioning themselves to help top brands adjust to faster fashion cycles.Bulgaria, Romania and other countries in the Balkan region have established a foothold in the luxury market and fashion houses from Paris and Milan are quietly building a bigger presence as they feed demand for a quicker turnover of styles.More affordable labels have long produced bags, scarves, clothes and shoes in southeastern Europe, but margins are becoming slimmer as Balkan companies jostle for that business with China, Turkey and, increasingly, Africa.The luxury sector is expected to grow up to 5 percent this year, outpacing fashion as a whole, encouraging southeastern Europe to focus its efforts on attracting more upmarket clients alongside competitors such as Portugal.""In the more luxury segment you make fewer pieces but they are more profitable, which is why we are now targeting them,"" Hristova said at her factory in Rousse, where some 40 workers stitch dresses, women's tops and trench coats.She said orders and inquiries from top brands were increasing and she has invested in machines to do the specialized stitches, buttons and ironing they demand alongside hand sewing, which is sometimes done through contractors.She is also installing a fitness room, new bathrooms and renovating the canteen to hold on to workers tempted by higher paying jobs elsewhere as Bulgaria's economy grows.For the brands, the cost advantage of nearby countries with the lowest wages in the European Union is not the only factor in an era where word of lapses in quality or poor working conditions spreads fast.""Convenience and proximity are only two of the precise criteria used by the Group to pick its suppliers; the essential requirements are quality, reliability and the respect of company conduct codes,"" said Italy's Armani, which confirmed it had some suppliers in eastern Europe.NO JUMPSTARTWhile top French and Italian luxury houses have experimented with manufacturing outside their home base for years now, it is often for more basic garments such as branded T-shirts.But the need for small batches of work, done fast, to exacting standards, is growing.Gone are the days when everything was geared towards a few pre-seasonal catwalk shows giving them months to roll out their collections. Now they depend on social media influencers whose audience is spoilt for choice and hungry for something new.""You need different producers, more capacities with shorter lead times,"" said Achim Berg, head of global apparel, fashion and luxury practice for management consultants McKinsey.Almost 80 percent of 200 luxury industry executives it surveyed saw proximity sourcing as a growing trend. It said luxury fashion is expected to grow four to five percent this year, compared with 3.5-4.5 percent rise for fashion as a whole. ""This is benefiting local producers in the southeastern European region,"" Berg said.Contracts for the assembly of parts or all of more intricate or big ticket items are on the increase, but brands are not always open about what, and how much, is produced abroad.Italian down coat maker Moncler (L:MONC), which is pioneering faster production times in the luxury world with monthly launches of limited editions, invested around 5 million euros to set up its own manufacturing plant in Romania in 2016.It accounts for some 20 percent of its puffer production and will be a research and development centre, CEO Remo Ruffini said.Hristova declined to give details of what she produced, citing confidentiality agreements. The website of her company, MIK-BG, lists Givenchy and Kenzo, two labels owned by Paris-based luxury conglomerate LVMH's (PA:LVMH). LVMH did not respond to requests to comment.It was two years ago, she said, when designer brands, often working through French agents place, began placing small orders on more basic items and conducting spot checks on workmanship.""There is no way to jumpstart with the luxury brands. You start with the lower end, once you prove yourself and deliver on the quality they demand, then you start to receive a higher class of clothes,"" she said, citing production times of four to six weeks.Mihai Tincu, who runs one of Romania's biggest clothing manufacturers, Rapsodia Conf, said luxury goods firms deliver materials for it to assemble and orders were getting bigger, mentioning Italy's Prada (HK:1913) and French fashion house Maison Margiela.Prada declined to comment while Maison Margiela said 90 percent of its products were made in Italy with the rest elsewhere, including Romania.Tincu said his was not the only firm working on the luxury front. ""There are other, smaller production outlets in the (northeastern) Botosani county that produce everything from shirts to suits for the world's majors.""SKILL SHORTAGEClothing exports have been growing strongly in Romania and Bulgaria for years but cost pressures are showing.In Romania they were 2.6 billion last year, Eurostat data shows, a seven percent dip from a record high the previous year, while Bulgaria exported 1.5 billion euros-worth, a slight dip from its record high a year earlier. Exports from Croatia and Slovenia were much smaller but on the rise.Bulgarian Association of Apparel and Textile Producers and Exporters chief Radina Bankova said salaries were becoming less competitive, a problem for the textile industry across Europe.In the first six months of last year, 4,000 people quit the sector, leaving around 88,000, just over half the number a decade ago. ""It is called light industry but it is not light at all. People need a lot of skills. And the people with the right set of skills are getting close to retiring age,"" Hristova said.Hence the drive upmarket where margins were better.""If a dress takes 100 minutes to make, the cost is 16 euros for mid-range and 40 euros for luxury brands, she said, adding the mantle of cheap clothing supplier, once held by Bulgaria, had long since moved to China and would shift again. ""The next Bulgaria will be somewhere in Africa, most probably,"" she said.Bankova listed Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss as companies producing in Bulgaria. Versace said some of its Versus and Versace Collection products were manufactured through suppliers in countries including Bulgaria and Romania. Hugo Boss said it was working with six suppliers in Bulgaria.Portugal also targets the luxury end. Its clothing exports rose some three percent last year to an all time high of 3.2 billion euros, according to Eurostat.The head of the Textile and Clothing Association, Paulo Vaz, said while Portuguese salaries were higher than in eastern Europe they were half those in France or Italy and cited lead times of two to five weeks.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Communications had previously fallen under the remit of Nicolas Bazire, in charge of development and acquisitions and managing director of Groupe Arnault, the family holding company that has a 47 percent stake in LVMH. The group made the change at a time of ""increased exposure"", including from public authorities and on social media, Bernard Arnault said in the internal memo seen by Reuters. Antoine Arnault, 41 - CEO of LVMH's Berluti, known for its high-end men's shoes, and chairman of luxury cashmere label Loro Piana - was already behind some communications initiatives at the group. They included organizing ""open days"" for the public at some brands. Most of Bernard Arnault's other children also work at LVMH. Daughter Delphine, 43, is number two at mega-brand Vuitton, the group's biggest revenue driver. Son Alexandre, 26, runs German luggage brand Rimowa, which LVMH bought in 2016, and Frederic, 23, is head of connected technologies at watch brand Tag Heuer. The youngest son, Jean, is still a student. Asked on several occasions which of his children was likely to succeed him, Bernard Arnault has always said the job would go to the most capable and the one who could combine business acumen with creative flair, without giving a name.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

82,"May 30, 2018 01:20PM ET",Moncler aspires to give its puffer jackets a monthly makeover,nan,"By Sarah White, Giulia Segreti and Claudia CristoferiMILAN (Reuters) - Italian label Moncler (MI:MONC) has already turned luxury fashion on its head by transforming casual skiwear into trendy items with its sleek puffer jackets.Now it wants to lead the sector in fast-paced production, and Chief Executive Remo Ruffini said he hopes his company can one day offer new products for all of its down coat collections on a monthly basis. The shift highlights luxury brands' race to adapt to changing shopping habits as the sector attracts younger consumers and those more influenced by the fast pace of social media, who are constantly seeking eye-catching new items. Moncler has already announced that, under what it calls its ""Genius"" strategy, it will from June offer each month a limited edition collection of down jackets specially produced for the label by a world famous designer, starting with Japanese streetwear king Hiroshi Fujiwara.But the shift could be more wide-ranging, Ruffini said, eventually encompassing Moncler's main puffer ranges - which account for 80 percent of its sales - and which are now phased into stores on a more drawn-out basis. ""I think and I hope that if everything goes well, we will work on a monthly basis for all collections,"" Ruffini told Reuters in an interview at Moncler's headquarters in Milan, adding that the overhaul was still in its early stages.""When you go to a store in July you find one concept, and when you go in September you find a totally different one, the one launched in that moment,"" he said. The overhaul also responds to a particular Moncler challenge: how to keep growing a business with a market value of 10 billion euros ($11.5 billion) that revolves around one star product, down jackets that can cost up to 2,000 euros.Ruffini is credited with reviving the company after buying in 2003 what was then a French mountain gear brand on the verge of bankruptcy.Adapting to the Genius plan involves an upgrade of technology and logistics, including investments in a new facilities center in Piacenza, near Milan, tightening oversight of Moncler's supply chain and bringing quality control in-house. ""It's really challenging. It's a change of culture in the company from logistics to production,"" Ruffini said, adding that most of the manufacturing will remain outsourced so that Moncler can easily raise or cut production at will. ""Flexibility is particularly important when you think on a monthly basis,"" the 56-year-old Italian entrepreneur said. Since Ruffini snapped up Moncler, the company's valuation has soared and it now trades at a premium to many luxury peers. Analysts have warned further upside could be limited, but are encouraged by the Genius strategy. (Graphic: Moncler recommendations May 30 - https://reut.rs/2L9behN)NEW ENERGYRuffini said Genius sales would be small, yet higher than the Gamme Bleu and Gamme Rouge catwalk collections which Moncler said in November would be phased out.""It's not a matter of revenues and top line... it's to give energy to the brand,"" he said. Analysts estimate those ranges accounted for less than 10 percent of Moncler's 1.2 billion euro in annual sales.Despite the Instagram-friendly nature of glitzy launches planned in stores, Ruffini said he wanted Genius, and the brand as a whole, to appeal in the same way to ""millennials and the ladies with the Hermes bag"", but without being skewed towards younger generations, seen as more fickle.""We believe the benefits from greater frequency drops far outweigh low probability execution risks from this revised approach,"" said Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""Over time we may see other luxury apparel brands follow.""Luxury labels from Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci to LVMH (PA:LVMH)'s Louis Vuitton do several mid-season collections beyond the traditional two a year, though none match the frequency of Moncler's planned ""Genius"" collections. ""The main concern with Moncler is the fashion risk,"" said Chiara Rotelli, an analyst at Mediobanca. ""The Genius project is reducing that concern ... showing that it is able to enlarge its proposition to reach a wider customer base."" Moncler's knitwear, shoes and accessories are also attracting more customers, but will never outshine the main product. ""I will always base my strategy on jackets, it's the uniqueness of Moncler,"" Ruffini said.(Graphic: Moncler catches up with  Kering  - https://reut.rs/2JgmXNZ)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

85,"May 01, 2018 01:40PM ET",Facebook to use augmented reality to draw ads to Messenger app,nan,"By David IngramMENLO PARK, Calif. (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's (O:FB) Messenger app launched an augmented reality feature on Tuesday to allow people to see products they are shopping for as if they already have them, such as a car parked in a driveway, in a move aimed at drawing in potential advertisers. Although smartphone messaging apps are not known for displaying ads, Facebook has said that targeting the 1.3 billion people who use its Messenger service with ads will be an important part of the company's long-term revenue growth. Silicon Valley tech firms are pouring money into augmented reality, a mix of the real and digital worlds best known from the game Pokemon Go. Facebook, at a tech conference that begins on Tuesday, is launching a new toolkit for software developers to make augmented reality features. David Marcus, head of Facebook's Messenger app, said in an interview that shoppers will be able to visualize and potentially test out products that advertisers have made available. Sephora, one of the first businesses that will use the feature, will let people virtually try on cosmetics.Similar augmented-reality features have proliferated on the apps of retailers such Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Ikea, which allow people to see how a toaster or couch would look in a room. Facebook, the world's largest social media network, has been encouraging businesses to use Messenger to talk with consumers, sometimes for customer service. Having businesses using Messenger helps Facebook's advertising business, Marcus said. Marketers can place ads directly in the service, and Facebook sells ads in its News Feed that connect to Messenger conversations. Messenger and the News Feed create a feedback loop like a ""flywheel"" for ad sales, Marcus said. Four businesses are participating in the launch: electronics company  Asustek  Computer Inc (TW:2357), automaker Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270), clothing company  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Sephora, a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH).WhatsApp, another Facebook-owned messaging service with more than 1 billion users, has sworn off advertising. WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said on Monday he was leaving. The Washington Post reported he was doing so in part after conflicts about advertising, which he opposes. Marcus said he was not worried about ads turning off Messenger users. People must opt in to talk with a business on the service. ""People actually find it helpful,"" he said.Messenger is trying to attract businesses in other ways, such as automated chat ""bots"" that can reply to customer inquiries. There are 300,000 bots on Messenger, three times more than a year ago, Marcus said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

88,"Apr 10, 2018 04:30AM ET",Autos drive European shares higher after Xi pledges tariff cut,nan,"By Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, led higher by gains among automakers after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised a considerable reduction in auto import tariffs this year.More broadly Xi's speech helped calm investor jitters over an escalating U.S.-China trade row that roiled markets last week, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark up 0.5 percent by 0756 GMT.The auto index (SXAP) was among the strongest, up as much as 2.1 percent with Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) leading the way.Xi promised to open China's economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars in a speech seen as conciliatory amid rising trade tensions with Washington.""We would see this as a major step towards opening the Chinese economy and to easing the very tense trade atmosphere... The primary beneficiaries would be German carmakers and the German economy as a whole,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote.According to their estimates this could lead to earnings tailwinds of up to 4.5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) for German carmakers. BMW is expected to benefit most, followed by Daimler and VW. Xi also said China would raise the foreign ownership limit in the auto sector ""as soon as possible"" and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector.Elsewhere mergers and acquisitions activity and earnings dominated trade. Bayer (DE:BAYGn) rose 4.9 percent after the WSJ reported that the U.S. Justice Department will allow the German drugs and pesticides group to acquire  Monsanto  (N:MON) in a $62.5 billion deal, after the companies agreed to sell more assets to win antitrust approval.If confirmed the approval would remove the last major obstacle to the deal, which Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said would be highly accretive for the German group.""If the Monsanto deal takes place, the implied portfolio change together with a potential agrochemical cycle recovery might lead to a re-rating,"" Mayer said.LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose 4.9 percent to record highs after the Louis Vuitton owner posted better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter, helped by thriving Chinese appetite for luxury goods. Its solid update boosted shares in other luxury companies such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP), up 3.7 percent.Higher-than-expected quarterly revenues lifted TGS Nopec (OL:TGS) up 12.9 percent to lead STOXX gainers.Givaudan was a weak spot after the fragrance and flavor maker reported a weaker-than-expected sales increase during its first quarter despite a boost from new contract wins and acquisitions.According to Thomson Reuters data, STOXX 600 earnings are estimated to rise 3.4 percent in the first quarter, with sales seen up 1.1 percent. Energy companies are expected to be the main drivers of growth. That compares to 18.5 percent earnings growth expected for the U.S.'s S&P 500 (SPX) index.The basic resources index (SXDP) was one of the strongest sectoral gainers, up 1.8 percent, as it recovered from large losses on Monday when stocks with exposure to Russia were hit after the United States unveiled fresh sanctions.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

A lawyer for the Paris-based company could not immediately be located.Levi said it has put distinctive tabs bearing its name, in the form of folded cloth ribbons, in the seams of its pants pockets since 1936, to provide ""sight identification"" for its products.It said Kenzo has not complied with its cease-and-desist letters to stop selling its own clothing bearing similar tabs, including in its ""Kenzo presents Britney Spears-La Collection Memento No. 2"" line launched last month.The complaint quoted Leo Christopher Lucier, Levi's national sales manager in 1936, as having said ""no other maker of overalls can have any other purpose in putting a colored tab on an outside patch pocket, unless for the express and sole purpose of copying our mark, and confusing the customer.""Levi is seeking to recoup lost profits, compensatory and punitive damages, and halt further infringements.The case is Levi Strauss & Co v Kenzo Paris USA LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-02106.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Hermes, known for its squared silk scarves as well as its hand-stitched $10,000 Kelly or Birkin bags, trades off its ""Made in France"" appeal and is famed for attracting long waiting lists. Like luxury peers, Hermes benefited from strong appetite from Asian shoppers in 2017, lifting its sales and profits to record levels.In the fourth quarter, sales growth slowed slightly from the previous three months, however, as stocks of its handbags ran low. Hermes, originally a saddle and equestrian equipment maker, said its 16th leather goods workshop, located in the country not far from the city of Mulhouse, would eventually house 260 specialists trained to hand-craft a bag from start to finish. Vuitton is also expanding its leather goods production with at least two new domestic workshops this year and next.Hermes has tended to pick sites in rural areas for its plants, hiring locally and training staff-in house, for workshops of around 300 people maximum. Hermes also plans two more production sites in France by 2020, and currently employs around 3,310 leather goods workers making everything from saddles to wallets. France's manufacturing sector has seen a burst of renewed job creation recently, after almost two decades of rapid de-industrialisation. The industrial sector saw its first net job creation since 2001 in the last three months of 2017, national statistics showed last month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The stock was up 2.3 percent to $25.47 on Wednesday.Three weeks ago Icahn reached a settlement with Newell that immediately gave him four board seats. Investors will have a chance to vote on the directors at next month's annual meeting. The deal was seen undercutting Starboard's campaign.Weeks before the two sides settled, Starboard, run by Jeffrey Smith, announced plans to oust the entire board, including Newell Chief Executive Officer Michael Polk.Starboard wanted to slow the pace of planned asset sales and stocked its slate with a group of former Newell directors who had resigned from the board earlier in the year after disagreements over strategy.Starboard is now pressing ahead, listing Smith, Peter Feld, Starboard's head of research, and executives with experience at companies ranging from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) to Michael Cos Inc (O:MIK) as possible directors. While Starboard is not seeking control, it has not said how many directors it plans to run.Former Newell directors Martin Franklin, Ian Ashman and Domenico DeSole as well as Jim Lillie who previously worked with Franklin, who had been on Starboard's earlier slate. They split with Starboard after Newell settled with Icahn.Franklin did not want to be caught between two activists, people who know him said.He told Reuters last month that his blank-check acquisition vehicle  J2 Acquisition  Ltd (L:JTWO) might be interested in buying assets that Newell may sell.Starboard has been well respected by other investors for its thoroughly laid-out plans on how to unlock value at targeted companies, industry analysts said.

93,"Mar 27, 2018 04:20PM ET",Louis Vuitton expands French manufacturing to meet handbag demand,nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisSAINTE-FLORENCE, France (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton, the biggest earnings driver at French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH), is expanding its leather goods and handbag production with at least two new workshops planned for this year and next, the brand said on Tuesday.The label, originally known for its travel trunks, will hire 500 people for two sites in western France, bringing its staff of leather goods specialists to around 4,000 as it looks to meet growing demand.One site will open by July this year, and another by early 2019. A third new opening should follow later next year, Vuitton's industrial director Emmanuel Mathieu said.Parent LVMH, also home to labels like Givenchy and Christian Dior, reported record profits and sales in 2017, helped like its peers by the rebounding appetite of Asian shoppers for luxury goods.Fashion labels derive some of their highest margins from leather goods like handbags and wallets.Vuitton makes the majority of these items in its home market, echoing rival Hermes (PA:HRMS), which trades off its ""Made in France"" appeal and is also due to open several new workshops by 2020.By early 2019 Vuitton will have 16 French leather workshops, the firm said. Its last opening was in 2017, following a lull since 2011, although it had increased staff at its sites in the meantime.France's manufacturing sector has seen a burst of renewed job creation recently, after almost two decades of rapid de-industrialization.The industrial sector saw its first net job creation since 2001 in the last three months of 2017, national statistics showed this month.Louis Vuitton, which owns all of its own stores, is also looking to cut lead times to help it react to sales trends, managers said. It aims to deliver handbags within a week of internal orders coming in, down from the current two weeks.""When we launch a new product we can adapt very quickly to demand,"" Mathieu said at one of Vuitton's existing plants near the village of Sainte-Florence in western France.Models including Vuitton's Twist bags or the mini Palm Springs backpacks are assembled by hand at the site by some 250 workers trained on specialist stitching machines. Vuitton does have several plants elsewhere, however, including two in California to cater to the U.S. market and a new one planned in Texas.It also has four workshops in the Spanish region of Catalonia, and production facilities in Portugal and Romania where it makes components like luggage handles.LVMH does not break out earnings for its brands, but analysts estimate Vuitton's sales reached at least 8 billion euros last year.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

96,"Mar 25, 2018 04:21PM ET",Booming online luxury goods sales convert watchmakers to the web,nan,"By Sarah White and Silke KoltrowitzBASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - A boom in online luxury goods sales is finally convincing high-end watchmakers, long skeptical that customers would pay thousands to buy intricate timepieces on the web, to step up their investments in e-commerce. Courting younger shoppers, brands large and small are joining an online push sweeping the luxury goods world, where web sales are already major growth drivers for fashion labels. ""We didn't realize the speed at which millennials would take to buying cars or watches online,"" said Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) watch business, in an interview at the Baselworld watch trade fair. LVMH's Tag Heuer, a label long associated with motor racing, is looking to fully build out its own shoppable sites over the next 18 months, Biver added. Tag already operates online stores in five countries including the United States and Britain, and has a partnership in China with JD.com (O:JD), the company said.LVMH sister brands Hublot and Zenith are yet to follow suit. Many watchmakers have flirted with web sales, though often through one-off collaborations with multi-brand web retailers. Tech-savvy shoppers in Asia have partly inspired a drive to do more - China overtook the United States last year as the leading source of traffic to luxury watch websites, according to consultancy DLG. And watchmakers have reasons to take control of their online image, as websites run by unofficial resellers proliferate. ""We want to reassure people, while taking into account that today clients also might like to buy their watch at home in the evening while they drink a glass of wine,"" said Jerome Biard, chief executive of Corum, owned by China's Citychamp (HK:0256).The Swiss brand's first e-commerce site will be fully operational in about two months, Biard said. NO TABOOSWeb sales are expected to make up a quarter of all global luxury goods sales by 2025, up from around 9 percent last year, consultancy Bain & Co projects. There are notable holdouts - France's Chanel shuns e-commerce for its coveted clothing, quilted handbags or watches. Watchmaker Rolex, owned by a private foundation, is not known to have any plans to build its own online shop.But others are stumping up serious cash, betting on online growth.  Richemont  (S:CFR), owner of Cartier and Baume & Mercier, is offering up to 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for full control of multi-brand site Yoox Net-a-Porter (MI:YNAP).""There is no taboo with buying online anymore,"" said Anish Bhatt, a watch enthusiast with 1.7 million followers on Instagram who works with brands such as Rolex, Richard Mille and Chopard on social media campaigns. Watchmakers were long hobbled by the perception sales could only happen in a certain environment, with ""shop assistants wearing silk gloves, while you sipped champagne,"" Bhatt added. PRICE LIMITS?Independent Swiss watchmaker Oris, Breitling, now owned by private equity firm CVC, and RJ, formerly known as Romain Jerome, have also confirmed plans to expand online operations. The push still comes with caveats and limitations, however. ""There are watch adjustments that require customers to pass through a store,"" said Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of LVMH's Italian jeweler and watchmaker Bulgari.Bulgari already sells through its sites in the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom, and is rolling out e-commerce to all of Europe by year-end. It aims to launch in Australia early in 2019.Bulgari sees 30,000-40,000 euros as the ceiling for the kind of watches it would sell online, Babin added.Yet even those boundaries may one day shift. Mr Porter, a men's style site run by Yoox Net-A-Porter, this week launched the sale of its most expensive item yet, a $480,000 watch made of sapphire by French label Bell & Ross.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

99,"Feb 18, 2018 07:10PM ET","Chanel, Farfetch pair up for digital push at fashion label's stores",nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - French couture house Chanel has taken a minority stake in London-based online retailer Farfetch, the companies said on Monday, as part of a tie-up to develop digital services such as chats to connect the label's clients with store assistants. Luxury goods companies worldwide are trying to expand their digital services to court younger or more tech-savvy clients.Privately-owned Chanel, famed for its tweed suits and quilted leather handbags, has been an outlier in the industry push to move more shopping online by deciding not to roll out web sales of its clothing and leather goods. Under the new deal, the label will not sell its wares through Farfetch but would work with the platform in coming years on digital innovations linked to customer services, said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's fashion president. These could include smartphone applications allowing people to flag their preferences and sizes online before entering a store, meaning assistants can cater to their needs, or help them locate an item spotted in a magazine for instance, he said. ""This is about how to enrich our relationship with our customers,"" Pavlovsky told Reuters, adding that Chanel was not trying to take a ""Big Brother"" approach of tracking clients but giving those who wished it more tailor-made assistance. He did not give any financial details about the tie-up. Farfetch has long been tipped for a stock market listing, and investment banks were recently pitching to work on a U.S. flotation later this year, sources said in January.Farfetch's other investors include Chinese online retailer JD.com (O:JD), French investment company Eurazeo (PA:EURA) and Singapore state investor Temasek. The online retailer's shopping platform connects buyers to luxury fashion items from more 700 boutiques worldwide. The firm has also invested in developing digital functions for stores, which can be adapted to suit its partners. Britain's Burberry said on Thursday it would team up with Farfetch.""The challenge for our luxury industry is that our clients are used to ultra-personalized experiences,"" Farfetch's Portuguese founder and Chief Executive Jose Neves said. ""When you walk into a store, people don't know you.""Chanel already offers select clients some digital support but wants to make this more widely available, Pavlovsky said, adding the firm would start testing new services this year.The brand has close to 200 stores. It sells cosmetics, eyeglasses and perfumes online, but says releasing other items on the web would make them less exclusive.Rivals such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton,  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci or Hermes (PA:HRMS) have taken a different tack, chasing sales growth by selling more online.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

103,"Jan 31, 2018 01:31PM ET",Farfetch gears up for fashion store of the future,nan,"By Sarah WhiteLONDON (Reuters) - London-based online fashion retailer Farfetch plans to roll out new technology to revolutionize shopping in stores in the coming months, its chief executive said on Wednesday. Farfetch, long tipped for a stock market listing, runs an online marketplace allowing people to buy luxury clothes or accessories from more than 700 brands and boutiques worldwide.After buying London boutique Browns in 2015, Farfetch is also working on technology that allows customers to flag a wish list of items via their phones when they stroll into a store, or even tell assistants that they are not feeling chatty.Portuguese CEO and founder Jose Neves, who previously started a shoe brand, said Farfetch is trialing such services and will start adapting them for other brands or boutiques.""The plan is to this year start rolling out very selectively to other partners,"" Neves said in an interview. ""We think it's a tremendous opportunity and it's actually inevitable. Retail shops still operate in the 80s.""Luxury goods firms including industry leaders like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) or Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have recently made a big push to sell their wares online, launching and revamping e-commerce sites for various labels. Cartier owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) last week said it would bid for full control of Farfetch's larger rival, luxury retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter (MI:YNAP), as it tries to do more on the web.Unlike Yoox, Farfetch does not have to stock inventory. LISTING ON THE CARDS? Online sales of high-end items such as shoes, clothing, jewellery, perfumes and handbags should rise to at least a fifth of the luxury goods market by 2025 from 8 percent in 2016, consultants McKinsey said in a report this week. Neves did not disclose how much Farfetch was investing in technology, and declined to comment on when the firm would turn a profit or potentially float. Farfetch doubled its pool of engineers to just under 1,000 between 2016 and 2017 - out of a total staff of 2,000 - and expects that figure to reach around 1,600 this year, with some 90 engineers working on the ""store of the future"", up from 60 now, Neves said. According to the latest available UK filings, Farfetch revenues increased by 74 percent in 2016 to 151.3 million pounds ($215 million), while net losses widened, to 34 million pounds. Neves said in late 2016 that a flotation could be on the cards in two or three years, while investment banks have recently been pitching to work on a possible U.S. listing, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. A fundraising round in 2016 valued the firm at around $1.5 billion. China's second-biggest e-commerce site, JD.com, has since invested in and partnered with Farfetch.China is one of Farfetch's fastest growing markets, Neves said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

106,"Jan 17, 2018 01:10AM ET","China luxury sales rebound as millennials snap up cosmetics, handbags: report",nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's luxury goods market is back in fashion.Domestic sales of Gucci handbags to Chanel cosmetics, sluggish in China for years, rose at the fastest pace in over half a decade last year and are poised to consolidate the gains in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co.That could provide a major fillip for brands targeting the world's top luxury spenders, though who benefits most will depend on which brands are able to lure in China's big-spending youth - now the driving force in the market.Sales of luxury goods in China hit 142 billion yuan ($22.07 billion) last year, up around 20 percent from the year before, Bain & Co said in a report on Wednesday. That's the sharpest growth since 2011, when luxury sales started to be hit by slower economic growth and a fierce crackdown on corruption.China's shoppers are the biggest spenders worldwide on luxury products, making up 32 percent of the 262 billion euros ($308 bln) global market last year and propelling France's LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Burberry  (L:BRBY) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP).""It's essentially been a flattish market for the last five years; now 2017 is plus 20 percent, that's an amazing rebound,"" said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain, adding lower pricing and government support were key drivers.The sharp rise - which saw particularly strong growth for women's clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, shoes and handbags - follows tepid growth in 2016 and dips in both 2015 and 2014.Beijing has been pushing for greater domestic spending, cracking down on shopping agents known as ""daigou"" bringing products into China from overseas, and cutting high tax rates on imported luxury goods sold in the country.China's domestic market makes up 8 percent of global luxury sales, according to Bain, and despite fast growth at home Chinese shoppers still make three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas.MILLENNIAL DRIVERSBain said China's luxury market should also see robust growth this year ""fueled by millennials and ready to wear"" attire, though the growth rate would likely slow down to ""low-mid teen"" levels given the fast growth in 2017.The revival is being driven by China's tech-savvy millennial generation aged between 20 to 34, who generally prefer ready-to-wear and fast fashion over more traditional design, helping propel new areas like luxury casual wear and sports wear.""This is a new China coming in as opposed to the old China coming back,"" said Lannes.That shift creates a challenge for more traditional brands like Prada (HK:1913), which is having to play catch up with newer rivals like Coach.Others like Hermes (PA:HRMS), France's LVMH and Kering are seeing revived appetite from China, helping boost their global sales last year.Luxury spirits makers, including China's own Kweichow  Moutai  (SS:600519) and France's  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP), saw a pick up in China sales too.Lannes added the fast growth would see winners and losers emerge, depending on who could crack the code of China's youth.""A new China is emerging with new consumers that were not there five years ago that have different profiles, different expectations and different tastes,"" he said.

107,"Jan 11, 2018 03:26PM ET",Luxury group Kering to spin off Puma to its own shareholders,nan,"By Arno Schuetze and Pamela BarbagliaFRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) plans to spin off German sports brand Puma (DE:PUMG) to the French conglomerate's shareholders to focus squarely on its luxury brands. Kering said on Thursday it planned to distribute 70 percent of Puma shares to its investors, leaving it with only a 16 percent stake, confirming an exclusive Reuters report.Puma shares were down 4.4 percent at the close as some investors worried about the company losing a powerful backer. Kering stock was down almost 1 percent.The deal comes after a recent turnaround at Puma, which struggled for years following Kering's 5.3 billion euros ($6.4 billion) purchase in 2007. The French firm, meanwhile, has long wanted to focus purely on its high-margin luxury business, where it rivals larger groups such as French conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH). ""We found ourselves in a sort of imbalance, linked to the outperformance of the luxury sector,"" Kering's finance chief Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists, adding the group would also look at options to shed its remaining sportswear label, Volcom. Kering is a little more than 40 percent controlled by France's Pinault family, which would receive about 29 percent of the sporting goods company, while Puma's free float would stand at about 55 percent. The French company was retaining a stake in Puma to reap some benefits from the brand's recovery, Duplaix said, as Kering will make no cash gains from the deal. The price of the transaction, which will be put to Kering shareholders in April at the group's annual meeting, has yet to be determined, he said. The disposal was likely to be a boost for Kering shares, analysts said. ""The Puma divestiture materializing sooner - rather than later - will add oomph to the stock,"" Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca said in a notePUMA TURNAROUNDUnder Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, appointed in 2013, Puma has refocused on its core sports business after sales were hurt by a shift into fashion products, ousting  Nike  as sponsor of English soccer club Arsenal.A distant third in the global sportswear market behind Nike and Adidas, Puma has focused on the world's most popular sports, such as soccer, running and motorsport, and launched a new drive to tap into booming sales of women's sportswear by appointing singer Rihanna as creative director in 2014. Puma said it welcomed the transaction because it increases the company's free float - or freely tradable shares. It added the move would not affect its current strategy. Puma will likely now be a candidate for inclusion in Germany's mid-cap index (MDAXI), Duplaix said. The sports goods company is due to report full-year results on Feb. 12, having increased its profit guidance three times last year on the popularity of the collections designed by Rihanna, and shoes worn by Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt.Like German rival Adidas (DE:ADSGn), Puma has enjoyed a revival in the United States as shoppers snap up its retro styles instead of basketball shoes, hurting Nike (N:NKE) and  Under Armour  (N:UAA).Puma's shares have risen by 45 percent over the past year, bringing its market capitalization to 5.3 billion euros, back at the level at which Kering bought. Kering emerged as one of the big winners in a luxury goods revival last year as Chinese demand picked up, with a stellar turn at brand-of-the-moment Gucci helping earnings, and other labels such as Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga doing well.

It rivals Luxury Pavilion, a similar portal launched in August which is backed by Alibaba's Tmall platform and features products from fashion groups such as  Burberry  (L:BRBY).Chinese shoppers made up 32 percent of the worldwide luxury market in 2017, more than any other nationality, consultancy Bain & Co said, making it a crucial market for fashion brands. KPMG has projected, meanwhile, that half of China's domestic luxury consumption could come from web sales by 2020. Online shopping has proved a potent earnings driver for fashion brands even if many were initially reluctant to distribute their wares too widely. Top labels such as Kering's Gucci or LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton recently started marketing directly to Chinese buyers with their own websites in the country.High-end fashion houses are still wary of alliances with mass-market platforms such as Amazon (O:AMZN), however, fearful they will lose control of their image.JD.com and Alibaba's specialist luxury platforms have already lured several other brands, touting themselves as more exclusive, selective sites.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

113,"Dec 06, 2017 07:10AM ET",Luxury brands lifted by EU court backing for online sales ban,nan,"By Foo Yun CheeLUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Coty and other luxury brands scored a landmark victory on Wednesday in their bid to stop retailers selling their products on online platforms such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and eBay (O:EBAY) when Europe's top court backed their right to protect their image.The issue is significant in Europe, whose companies account for 70 percent of global luxury goods sales. Luxury owners have long waged a battle against what they see as free riders cashing in on their exclusivity and branding. Online platforms such as Amazon and eBay, in turn, say online sales curbs are anti-competitive and hurt small businesses.The Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) ruling came in a case involving U.S. cosmetics maker Coty's (N:COTY) German subsidiary and German retailer Parfumerie Akzente, which sells Coty's goods on sites including Amazon against the company's wishes.A German court had sought guidance on whether banning online sales on third-party sites restricted competition.""A supplier of luxury goods can prohibit its authorized distributors from selling those goods on a third-party internet platform such as Amazon,"" the ECJ said.""Such a prohibition is appropriate and does not, in principle, go beyond what is necessary to preserve the luxury image of the goods.""Coty, whose brands include Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein and Chloe, welcomed the ruling, which carries legal weight across the 28-nation EU.""After years of uncertainty, this means luxury brands can determine how they are placed on digital platforms and it is a clear ruling for the protection of luxury brands' image, the defense of our teams' work and the protection of consumers' rights and information,"" the company said.Parfumerie Akzente said it meets the terms for online sales set by luxury owners.""Authorized merchants such as us may sell brand-name products on outward-visible third-party platforms, provided that we meet the conditions that are necessary and reasonable for preserving the luxury image,"" Chief Executive Kai Renchen said in a statement. Amazon declined to comment.After intense lobbying by LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Richemont  (S:CFR) and other luxury goods companies, EU antitrust regulators laid down rules in 2010 allowing brand owners with less than a 30 percent market share to block online retailers without a bricks-and-mortar shop from distributing their products.The issue has split EU countries, with Germany more eager to promote e-commerce. In two test cases in recent years, the German cartel office forced Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and Asics (T:7936) to drop such bans, saying online platforms are crucial for small- and medium-sized companies and consumers.The German cartel office said it expected the court's ruling to have a limited effect on its policy, noting that its decisions had involved brand manufacturers from outside the luxury industries.""Our preliminary view is that such manufacturers have not received carte blanche to impose blanket bans on selling via platforms,"" the office's president, Andreas Mundt, said in a statement.Germany will now have to fall in line though, said a competition lawyer, who declined to be named.""This judgment sets the principles for the EU as a whole. Germany will have to align with European case law and accept this kind of restrictions unless it contradicts some conditions in competition law,"" he said.The case is C-230/15 Coty Germany.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

114,"Nov 24, 2017 01:40PM ET","Online sales? Maybe one day, says Chanel",nan,"By Sarah White and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - France's Chanel has no immediate plans for online sales of its coveted outfits or handbags, a senior executive said on Friday, making it one of the fashion world's last hold-outs as rivals experiment with websites to win over new clients. The label, known for its tweed suits and $4,300-plus quilted leather bags, already sells perfumes online, like its Chanel No 5, as well as eyeglasses and beauty products. But it will draw the line there for the foreseeable future, said Bruno Pavlovsky, president of fashion at Chanel.""If you give everything to everyone straight away, I think you lose that exclusivity,"" Pavlovsky told a Vogue conference in Paris. ""I'm not saying we won't try it one day, but if we do it will be because we'll really think there's some added value.""Luxury goods brands were slow to develop e-commerce sites as they worried that making products too widely available would erode their cachet. But most have now taken the plunge. Conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH), parent to Louis Vuitton, hired a former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) executive and recently launched a site hosting multiple labels, though its online strategy at each of its brands still varies wildly.Web sales will make up some 10 percent of revenues in the luxury goods market this year, according to consultancy Bain, which projects they could reach 25 percent by 2025. But Chanel's out-of-step attitude was not a drag on the business, Pavlovsky said, adding that the label, founded by Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel in 1910, was reaching an increasingly young audience and had waiting lists for best-selling bags. Controlled by secretive billionaires Alain and Gerard Wertheimer, Chanel does not regularly release financial results.According to figures filed with the Amsterdam exchange, Chanel's net profit fell nearly 35 percent in 2016 and sales dropped 9 percent to $5.7 billion.Most major rivals have enjoyed a sales bounce in 2017. Chanel is no stranger to digital marketing, however, showing images on media like Instagram and Twitter from its extravagant catwalk shows and collections by designer Karl Lagerfeld. But buyers want to try on the clothes, Pavlovsky said, adding that the business would look into providing ""e-services"" to allow buyers to reserve items online or make store appointments. ""Every time I'm in China I meet clients who come and say, 'whatever you do don't do e-commerce.

117,"Nov 06, 2017 01:20PM ET",Exclusive: France's Lanvin in financial straits as sales slump - sources,nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Auditors for Lanvin, France's oldest fashion house, have filed a warning with a commercial court in Paris over financial troubles at the label as it struggles to stem slumping sales, two sources familiar with the company's performance said.The privately-owned label, founded in 1889 and long synonymous with Parisian chic, does not publish its earnings. However, the sources said the company's provisional forecast for the year shows sales will fall 30 percent in 2017 after a 23 percent drop last year.Under French company law auditors have to inform managers and file court warnings when a firm's operations risk being compromised by its financial situation. Lanvin and the auditor did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Lanvin has had trouble inspiring buyers since it stunned the fashion industry two years ago by firing star designer Alber Elbaz. The label has changed artistic director twice since then. ""The auditor has now alerted the Paris commercial court over the company's very worrying situation,"" one of the sources said. The sources said Lanvin needed an injection of cash to buy some breathing space or it may not be able to pay employees' salaries in January. However, they added that a recapitalization originally discussed for September may yet happen by the end of the year. The company is majority held by Chinese-born businesswoman Shaw-Lan Wang. It made an 18.3 million euro loss in 2016, sources with knowledge of the situation had previously told Reuters. They forecast that losses were set to deepen to at least 27 million euros in 2017.STRUGGLING FOR ORDERSLanvin's financial struggles come as rivals including France's Louis Vuitton, part of LVMH (PA:LVMH), and Italy's Gucci, owned by  Kering  (PA:PRTP), enjoy a sales bounce driven by resurgent demand from China. New artistic chief Olivier Lapidus - who has designed menswear for Balmain as well as wedding dresses and furniture -- has yet to make his mark. Industry analysts acknowledge brand reiventions can take several seasons before translating into an earnings boost. Lanvin unveiled its latest collection in September. Orders at the showroom, where designs are presented to department store buyers, were down about 50 percent on the previous year, a third source familiar with the matter said.Lapidus's collection - a sober array of skimpy mini-dresses, many in black or imprinted with an assortment of letters evoking the Lanvin brand - was put together in 42 days after his appointment in July. ""The buyers are struggling to figure out Lanvin and were thrown by the sudden appearance of the logo on the clothes,"" the third source added.More ostentatious branding has worked well for other labels in recent years, including Christian Dior, although it was traditionally not an approach taken by Lanvin.Lapidus's predecessor, Bouchra Jarrar, had brought in a more tailored style - a shift from Elbaz's more exuberant, frilly designs - that also failed to reignite sales. Lanvin has been closing unprofitable stores and cutting advertising spending to control costs. Named after founding French ""couturiere"" Jeanne Lanvin, the label employed some 300 staff at the end of 2016.Wang, a media magnate based in Taiwan, owns 75 percent of Lanvin, with the remainder held by Swiss businessman Ralph Bartel, who stepped down from the firm's board in July. Bartel has previously offered to inject extra capital into the label in exchange for majority control.Lanvin has shaken up its management in recent months with a series of board changes, including the appointment of Nicolas Druz, who was a close advisor to Wang and has just been appointed deputy managing director.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Hermes is also known for its printed silk scarves and neckties and makes perfume and watches, but its leather division - home to coveted handbags that are often only available through a waiting list - is its biggest revenue driver. Sales in that unit were up 12.2 percent in the first half of the year at constant exchange rates, while revenue across the group grew 9.7 percent.The broader luxury goods industry is enjoying a comeback after several years as Chinese demand improves following a slowdown, and younger shoppers worldwide show a growing taste for high-end goods, boosting online sales.Many firms are wary about 2018, however, as comparatives become less favorable following a buoyant year for growth. A strengthening euro is also making a dent in earnings when converted into the currency, and could put off some buyers.Hermes is due to report third quarter sales on Nov. 8.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

121,"Oct 25, 2017 04:30AM ET",Chinese and millennial shoppers drive rebound in luxury goods sales: Bain,nan,"By Sarah White and Giulia SegretiPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Worldwide sales of luxury goods such as high-end handbags, shoes and jewelry are growing faster than expected this year thanks to thriving demand from Chinese customers and young shoppers, according to consultancy Bain & Co.After stalling in 2016, revenues from personal luxury goods are set to rise 6 percent at constant exchange rates in 2017 to 262 billion euros ($308 bln), Bain forecast in an annual report released on Wednesday, compiled with Italy's Altagamma. That trumped an earlier projection for 2 to 4 percent growth. The rosy outlook tallies with stronger earnings at many luxury retailers, such as France's LVMH (PA:LVMH), owner of jeweler Bulgari and fashion house Louis Vuitton, or Italy's Brunello Cucinelli (MI:BCU). A spate of security threats in Europe had curbed tourist spending in the region in recent years while a Chinese economic slowdown had rattled the luxury sector. But visitors to Europe are splashing out again and demand from middle class Chinese has rebounded quickly, helping to offset a more muted U.S. market.Retailers' attempts to connect with younger buyers and bridge a price divide between Europe and more expensive Asia were also paying off, Bain said. ""Luxury goods companies have rethought strategies and are now regaining the trust they lost from customers,"" said Federica Levato, a partner at Bain and a co-author of the report. The growth this year is ""healthier"", driven by a rise in volumes rather than in prices and is balanced between tourist purchases and local buyers, Levato added. Chinese buyers made up 32 percent of the luxury goods market in 2017 - more than any other nationality - thanks to both rising purchases in their home market and abroad. The industry as a whole could notch up annual growth rates of 4 to 5 percent until 2020, Bain projected, at a time when online sales, once a more peripheral channel for luxury brands wanting to project an air of exclusivity, are growing steadily.They are forecast to reach a quarter of all sales by 2025, up from 9 percent at present. GENERATION ZMillennials, born between the early 1980s and mid-90s and who already represent a third of the market, and the later ""generation Z"", which grew up with smartphones, are starting to make a dent in the luxury market, Bain said. Brands have been increasingly turning to social media or pairing up with popstars and so-called influencers, making sure their products chime with younger tastes and branching into casualwear and streetwear, with t-shirts, sneakers and denim. These efforts come at a cost, however. While 65 percent of luxury firms will experience sales growth in 2017, only 35 percent will manage to increase their operating profit, Bain found. Young buyers are notoriously fickle, happily jumping from one brand to the other and keeping retailers on their toes. ""It raises the bar in how companies are thinking about their marketing strategies. It was traditionally just beautiful pictures in a landscape with a beautiful product, this is not the case any more,"" Levato said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Sales at Hennessy, one of LVMH's big revenue drivers, are set to grow at a much more muted pace over the coming quarters as it grapples with low stocks and production problems, including hail and frost that hurt recent harvests.With no quick fixes likely - cognac is a double-distilled spirit that needs to be aged for at last two years - Hennessy is tackling production constraints with an eye on the longer term, by planting more grapes, Arnault said. ""There is land within the area which is not being used,"" Arnault, LVMH's chairman and chief executive, told journalists at a new Hennessy bottling plant near the city of Cognac, on the banks of the Charente river in western France. The label works with 1,600 winegrowers there. ""We have a bottle shortage, given the success of our products across the Atlantic and in China,"" he said.The acquisitive businessman - whose sprawling LVMH group, the world's biggest luxury goods producer, includes fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton and champagne label Moet & Chandon - ruled out buying up rival cognac makers to fix shortages.Hennessy is looking to produce more of its lower-end ""VS"" stocks for the United States, the world's biggest cognac importer where the spirit is a popular base for cocktails.Cognac has also shed its fusty image to become a hit with rap musicians. ""We will try to boost the product for which we have the greatest demand to satisfy ... I'm certain that in a year or two we can do it,"" Arnault said. Smaller peers such as  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) are hoping to capitalize on Hennessy's U.S. blip to take market share. Hennessy says it has 50 percent of the global cognac market.Newer vineyards may take over six years to provide Hennessy with saleable cognac, but the firm would be able to release more stocks in the shorter term knowing it has more coming, Hennessy's CEO Bernard Peillon said. The new 100 million-euro plant will lift Hennessy's annual production capacity from 2019-20 onwards to 10 million crates of Cognac bottles, up from 7 million now.Sales at LVMH's wine and spirits unit grew 4 percent on a comparable basis in the third quarter from a year ago, down from growth of 6 percent three months earlier.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

130,"Sep 28, 2017 09:24AM ET",A little help from 'Mr Bags'? Prada plays catch-up online in China,nan,"By Pei Li and Giulia SegretiBEIJING/MILAN (Reuters) - At Prada's (HK:1913) Spring/Summer 2018 show in Milan last week in a warehouse papered with giant pop-art comic strips, one name in the coveted front row stood out: Tao Liang, otherwise known as Chinese blogger 'Mr Bags'.His presence alongside Vogue's Anna Wintour and Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni is a sign of Prada's efforts to turn around its business with a focus on the digital sphere - where it has lost ground to rivals including Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci.And nowhere is a revival more critical than in China, which accounts for close to a third of all global luxury sales. Crucially, Chinese luxury buyers tend to be younger than elsewhere, and online influencers like 'Mr Bags' carry real clout.Prada, whose profits and sales have been sliding, is playing catch-up with rivals like Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH), Fendi and even the more affordable luxury brands like  Coach  (N:COH). All have raced ahead, forging tie-ups with bloggers and online stars who draw in Asia's smartphone-obsessed youth.While online influencers are a force globally, in China, bloggers like 'Mr Bags', 'Gogoboi' or 'FreshBoy' can have tens of millions of followers, and an outsized say on shopping trends.""The key opinion leaders (KOLs) in China are very powerful. They can promote a product to an extent that no counterparts in Europe can match,"" said Chinese fashion blogger Yang Dong, who has called Prada the ""depressed teenager"" of luxury brands.Yang said Prada's issue in the market was not its design.""When other brands roll out new products, they first come to China weeks in advance and get Internet celebrities and KOLs to lead the trend,"" he said. ""If Prada doesn't put its marketing focus on China, it will lose more ground.""Prada, which appointed a new global digital director, Chiara Tosato, in March, is starting to catch on. Tosato said earlier this month the fashion house would look to drive online sales globally - a change from 2014, when CEO Patrizio Bertelli said it would focus on physical stores.Prada will this year complete the roll-out of its e-commerce platform in key markets including China, South Korea, Japan, Australia and Russia. It's already active in Europe and the United States.Prada declined to comment for this article.RISKS AND REWARDSTo be sure, an online presence won't solve other issues like too many shops, and customers can feel some tie-ups make the brand less aspirational. Online buyers can also be more fickle.Yet Prada's modest online sales target, including sales through e-tailer partners, is for 5 percent of its total by end-2018. For smaller, luxury outerwear maker Moncler (MI:MONC), it's 6 percent this year - meaning it's already reaping the data dividends that come with online sales.The power of China's online stars means they are impossible to ignore in a country where hundreds of millions of people use microblogs such as Weibo (O:WB).Top fashion blogger 'Gogoboi' has more than 7 million followers there. 'Mr Bags' has a more modest 3 million, but is seen as a leading influencer when it comes to accessories.""When a new bag comes out, probably it doesn't get much attention. But when a fashion blogger or celebrity carries it, it's suddenly out of stock,"" said Yang Lei, a Chinese online shopping agent selling luxury goods back to China.And Prada needs that support.Even as its China sales recovered slightly in the first half of this year, to 302 million euros ($359 million), Prada's global profits fell 18 percent, after a 2016 bottom line that was its lowest since its 2011 initial public offering. Gucci, meanwhile, has seen its sales jump.Of course, slow-to-digital was not Prada's only issue. It also opened more stores than its mega-brand rivals and failed to spot the power of high-margin casualwear.A Reuters analysis of Weibo shows Prada far behind Coach, Gucci and Louis Vuitton in terms of celebrity tie-ups and endorsements online. The brand has 309,000 followers on the popular platform - around a tenth of what Coach can boast.Unlike some rivals, Prada has steered clear of creating limited edition capsule collections in collaboration with influencers. In contrast, a young, fringe Chinese rap group told Reuters they were in talks with Coach over a tie-up - a sign that even potential future stars are being tapped.""The power of digital is a critical part of our global transformation plan ... we are always seeking innovative ways to leverage social platforms,"" a Coach spokesperson told Reuters, adding that partnering with Chinese actress Tiffany Tang and singer Timmy Xu ""is one way we are working with KOLs to build emotional bonds with our consumers.""Prada is finally following, albeit cautiously.""Prada works with influencers in different regions including Asia, but will push into this more and increase collaborations,"" a person familiar with its plans told Reuters, noting Prada is ""not obsessed"" with collaboration and doesn't want to dilute its brand.Alongside 'Mr Bags' in Milan last week, Prada also hosted Filipino fashion blogger 'BryanBoy', Hong Kong actress Tina Leung, South Korean model Irene Kim and Singaporean designer Yoyo Cao.Prada has also done pop-up stores focused on Asia, aiming at millennial shoppers.That push could help reach consumers like Xu Dan, a 28-year-old business development worker in Beijing, who says she reads all 'Mr Bags' posts: ""I trust these bloggers' sensitivity to fashion.""Not everyone will be easy to move.Akane Kishi, a 29-year-old human resources worker shopping in Tokyo, said Prada had just not kept up. ""I often see Fendi on Instagram and think I want to buy that one, in that color,"" she said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

131,"Sep 25, 2017 08:51AM ET",Unilever steps up beauty push with $2.7 billion Carver Korea deal,nan,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Martinne GellerSEOUL/LONDON (Reuters) -  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) has agreed to pay 2.27 billion euros ($2.71 billion) to buy fast-growing cosmetics company Carver Korea in its latest move to build a global beauty business.The purchase from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bain Capital and Carver's founder follows a string of smaller skincare and cosmetics deals as the Anglo-Dutch pivots away from slower-growth food.The deal announced on Monday gives Unilever what it said is the fastest-growing skincare business in South Korea through its AHC brand of anti-ageing creams, moisturisers and other skin products. Carver also provides a strong foothold in North Asia, the world's largest skincare market, Unilever said.""Unilever continues to build a portfolio of niche brands in premium beauty to capture opportunities in high-margin dynamic categories,"" said Ildiko Szalai, analyst at Euromonitor International, which says the South Korean beauty and personal care market has grown faster than the global average over the past five years.Korean beauty brands are in huge demand throughout Asia and have attracted investors including LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) over the past couple of years.Monday's deal comes even though political tensions between China and South Korea have dented earnings of many South Korean cosmetics businesses. Chinese tourists have been big buyers of South Korean cosmetics but China this year banned group tours to the country over Seoul's decision to deploy an anti-missile system to counter North Korean threats.VALUATION JUMPBain and Goldman Sachs jointly bought about 60 percent of Carver for roughly $500 million last year, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.That would have valued the whole company at $833 million, less than a third of what Unilever is paying, but Carver's net profit nearly quadrupled last year to $117 million, from $32 million in 2015, public filings show.Unilever said that Carver's 2016 sales were 321 million euros ($381 million) with core profit of 137 million euros. Based on that figure, Unilever paid 16.6 times EBITDA, in line with home and personal care deals over the past decade. Unilever is working hard to boost its performance after an unexpected takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) in February. It has since raised its margin target, announced a share buyback and a plan to sell its shrinking margarine and spreads business.The company had already been trying to become more reliant on bath, body and beauty products, which tend to have higher growth and margins than food. To that end, it has bought a string of higher-end cosmetics and skincare companies including Murad, Dermalogica, REN and Kate Somerville. Bain and Goldman held 60.39 percent of Carver at the end of 2016, while its founder Lee Sang-rok held a 35 percent stake.Carver Korea, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs were not available for immediate comment.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

132,"Sep 20, 2017 02:20PM ET",LVMH keen to be green as sector embraces ethical fashion,nan,"By Sarah WhitePARIS (Reuters) - LVMH (PA:LVMH), the world's largest luxury group, will invest more to improve its environmental credentials as fashion businesses seek to reassure shoppers who are increasingly drawn to eco-friendly brands, it said on Wednesday. In an industry not known for half-measures and that has drawn flak for cruel or wasteful practices, including some companies embroiled in animal abuse scandals, many luxury houses are trying to improve their ""green"" image. Beyond tightening standards on the way some materials are sourced, including the leather used for handbags, companies are also running the rule over everything from packaging to the type of energy-saving lightbulbs used in their stores. LVMH, which owns fashion house Louis Vuitton and champagne maker Moet & Chandon among its 70 businesses, said its companies would be contributing 30 euros to an in-house carbon fund for every tonne of CO2 emissions they generate from 2018, up from 15 euros previously. Those funds are then earmarked for insulating buildings and other projects. LVMH has rarely publicized its sustainability targets, in contrast with Paris-based rival  Kering  (PA:PRTP). However, it said that it is working on other steps such as raising the share of leather goods sourced from strictly monitored tanneries to 70 percent by 2020. ""Our clients are more and more sensitive to the fact the products they consume should respect the environment,"" its billionaire Chairman Bernard Arnault told journalists. ""Our partners and clients are very attached to this aspect and it seemed logical to make a shift and talk about it a little more.""Consumers have become more sensitive to how clothes and accessories are made, with some fast-fashion companies in particular coming under fire for exploitative working conditions or the use of fabrics that encourage pollution. At the luxury end of the scale, companies have been careful to protect their standards and image, even if they still sometimes parade models in fur coats. France's Hermes was caught in a storm two years ago when a crocodile farm used to supply leather for one of its best-selling handbags was accused of cruel slaughter practices.""What motivates these luxury groups to be more and more vigilant is that they run a reputational risk,"" said Olivier Abtan of Boston Consulting Group. Kering, which owns Gucci and Alexander McQueen, has long promoted its eco-friendly credentials and since 2015 has broken out accounts for the environmental impact of its business. It also works with Stella McCartney, a brand well known for shunning leather or fur in its designs.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Kors said earlier this week it would buy Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion and plans to expand the line by opening more stores, especially in Asia.Jimmy Choo, whose towering stilettos were made famous by characters in the popular TV series ""Sex and the City,"" is synonymous with affluence, and somewhat at odds with Kors' image of accessible luxury.It could be argued that Jimmy Choo will give Kors's tumbling sales and stock a leg up, but experts said Kors' expansion plans could dilute the shoemaker's brandname.""Revenue expansion doesn't come from opening stores today, but figuring out how to unlock the e-commerce component and (Kors) haven't proven that they get that either,"" said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.Kors has made this mistake before.Once a seller of popular Mercer and Hamilton handbags, Kors put its wares too quickly on too many shelves, making them ubiquitous.Since then, the company has struggled to come up with designs that have caught the fancy of the well-heeled buyer, who have gravitated toward bags offered by  Coach  Inc (N:COH) and Tory Burch.Kors' has been trying to stem the sales declines by expanding into dresses, menswear and online, but has had little success. ""If (Kors) had fixed their U.S. market, if they'd shown improvements there and then made this acquisition, people would be a lot more comfortable with it,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, analyst at A-Line partners.""For (Jimmy Choo), I could see them opening in another market but I think that is what makes everyone nervous. It is like: ""Look what they did with the Michael Kors brand, are they going to do that to Jimmy Choo?""MULTIBRAND STRATEGYKors' rival Coach Inc (N:COH) faced similar problems not so long ago.But Coach responded quickly, by tightening supplies to department stores to regain its luxury cachet, before diversifying with the buyout of upscale shoemaker Stuart Weitzman in 2015.The company recently bought smaller rival Kate Spade, whose products are a hit with millennials.Both retailers seem to be looking to emulate the successful multibrand strategy employed by European companies LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP), where cash flows from one large brand are reinvested into smaller but faster growing ones.These two companies have grown into luxury powerhouses by buying multiple luxury brands such as Christian Dior, Tag Heuer, Gucci, and Alexander McQueen.Kors' CEO John Idol said the company would look to grow by buying more globally recognized luxury brands like Jimmy Choo.""... we are really looking to build an international luxury company and less so brands that ... have a greater reliance on wholesale than its own retail strategy,"" he said on a conference call on Tuesday.Idol said Jimmy Choo would be run independently with minimal interference from Kors' management and that he doesn't want the two brands to be linked with each other.But analysts said while this could be the right approach for Coach, which has a creative, forward-thinking team, it could overwhelm Kors, at least initially.Kors will need to have a deep understanding of demand, it will have to innovate to drive excitement, maintain the trueness of the brands it acquires, and little or no overlap with other brands in its portfolio, said Jason Green, CEO of customer strategy firm Cambridge Group.For now at least, analysts said, Kors should be looking to walk before it runs.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

144,"May 04, 2017 10:00AM ET",Bubble risks loom for Italy's small caps as new fund scheme sparks rally,nan,"By Maria Pia Quaglia and Danilo MasoniMILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks and asset managers are rushing to tap a 10 billion-euro ($11 billion) wave of money expected to flow into small- and mid-caps, as clients seek tax breaks on investments in a government-sponsored plan, potentially creating a bubble.The scheme, called Piano Individuale di Risparmio (PIR), offers tax savings if part of the money is invested into small-sized domestic stocks and locked in for five years.Final details are still missing but that has not stopped a rush that has sent indexes tracking Italy's small-caps to all-time highs, easily outpacing the country's bluechips (FTMIB) and peers in other European markets.PIR, along with easing political risks and a brighter economic outlook, is also drawing money into Italian asset managers.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) noted that inflows at Italian fund managers were outperforming those seen in the industry elsewhere in the region, adding that PIR could give the Italian fund industry a ""new lease of life"".However, the rapid rally in small-caps and rush of funds is sparking worries about a price bubble forming as valuations diverge from fundamentals.The rally, which gained steam at the start of 2017, has lifted valuations of some industrial companies to extreme levels that are usually a privilege of top luxury groups like  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) or LVMH (PA:LVMH).Italy's STAR index (FTSTAR), which tracks companies worth 1 billion euros or less, is up 29 percent this year to record highs, leaving behind peers in France (CACMS) or Germany where gains are less than half that. Pan-European small caps (SCXP) are up 12 percent.""The risk of a bubble is there: a lot of money is rapidly flowing,"" Banca  Mediolanum  (MI:BMED) CEO Massimo Doris said at a conference. His firm, one of Italy's biggest asset gatherers, has already launched funds that are compliant with the tax break scheme.Only six months ago Italy's smaller firms were off limits for overseas investors, who feared political turmoil in the euro zone could leave them trapped in illiquid stocks.But a conference this year where executives from STAR-listed companies presented to investors saw a record number of meetings involving more than 100 foreign investment houses including from France, Switzerland, Germany, the Nordics and the United States.DON'T BE GREEDY""Our advice is 'enjoy the rally but don't be greedy',"" said Citi's Mauro Baragiola, the first analyst at a foreign brokerage to warn clients about a potential bubble.Valuations are getting stretched, leaving little room for disappointment on the earnings front.Alessandro Pacchiani, head of asset management at Banca Ifigest in Milan said there were high risks of significant corrections, especially for firms listed in the STAR segment, where some multiples were ""too generous"".""We hope the market will start to be selective,"" he said.According to Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), companies like industrial machinery producer IMA (MI:IMAI), pump maker Interpump (MI:ITPG) and Datalogic (MI:DAL), which makes bar code readers, have already reached peak multiples.These companies are priced at 27-33 times earnings, more than twice as much as the average for the STAR index they are listed on. As a whole the STAR is still cheaper than its German and French peers.One hope is that the rally in small-caps stokes the market for new listings and share sales as entrepreneurs tap investor enthusiasm to raise new capital when valuations are high.A fresh supply of shares coming to the market may lessen the risk of overheating.""If IPOs and share sales grow any bubble would deflate, multiplying opportunities and attracting institutional investors from abroad,"" Mediolanum's Doris said."

That will unite the 70 year old fashion label worn by film stars from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman with the Christian Dior perfume and beauty business already owned by LVMH. The Arnault family, which holds a 47 percent stake in LVMH, will also offer to buy the 25.9 percent of the Christian Dior holding company it does not already own for about 260 euros per share, a premium of 15 percent over Monday's closing price.

Dior shares jumped 13 percent to a new high of 256 euros.

148,"Apr 25, 2017 05:12AM ET", European stocks continue rally with eyes on M&A and earnings,nan,"Investing.com – European stock markets extended their rally on Tuesday while global stock markets reached record highs as a wave of relief over the first-round French presidential election results continued to sweep through equity markets.Nearing midday trade in Europe, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.25%, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.15% while Germany’s DAX 30 inched up 0.03%.After the largely expected victory of centrist Emmanuel Macron in the first round of voting, polls also predict that he will become the French President by a comfortable margin in the final runoff with far-right, euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen on May 7, easing fears over a possible French exit from the euro zone.In a session lacking in major economic reports, French business confidence unexpectedly increased in April, hitting its highest level in almost six years.On the company front,  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) surged more than 10% as luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH) and billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault announced Tuesday that they would buy the shares in the firm that they do not already own.In other corporate movements,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said it was interesting in buying three Italian savings banks though the French financial institution added that the project was still “in the very early stages”.European earnings out Tuesday gave a mixed reading with  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) leading the Stoxx 600 lower with losses of around 7% as the British hotel and coffee chain reported earnings and gave a cautious outlook, forecasting ""a tougher consumer environment than last year”.

150,"Apr 13, 2017 04:47AM ET",Gray market has become a necessary evil for luxury watchmakers,nan,"By Silke KoltrowitzZURICH (Reuters) - A diamond-studded Rolex at 40 percent off the $34,000 retail price or an Omega Speedmaster Moonphase for less than $10,000? While still out of reach for most people, the increasing prevalence of such deals highlights the perplexing predicament in which luxury watchmakers now find themselves.With sales falling, more unsold timepieces are finding their way from the Swiss-dominated industry's carefully controlled official retail networks to online platforms where they are often offered at steep discounts.Swiss watchmakers say they loathe this ""gray market"" because high discounts damage the meticulously crafted aura of prestige and make it harder to sell their goods at the full price. ""In luxury goods, when you break the illusion of prestige, the dream, the prices, it takes away the confidence. It means slow death for luxury goods,"" Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) watch division, told Reuters at last month's Baselworld watch fair, describing the gray market as the ""industry's cancer"". However, a sudden end to a boom in Chinese demand is forcing the brands to begin working quietly with dealers in the gray market, occasionally to help with sales but mostly to secure some influence over the unofficial resellers, according to dealers and industry executives interviewed by Reuters. ""There are many sources for gray market watches: authorized retailers who want to get rid of slow-selling models, country distributors or even the brands themselves,"" said one watch industry executive who asked not to be named. He said that in some cases operators in the gray market are cooperating with the brands, removing new models from sale when asked or reducing discounts manufacturers consider excessive.FREE ADVERTISING Though representatives of the biggest luxury watchmakers, including Swatch Group (S:UHR) and  Richemont  (S:CFR), refused to discuss their strategy with regard to the gray market, some manufacturers may find that it offers benefits.""For every timepiece we sell, the manufacturer is getting the lion's share of the profit, and then all the search engine queries, image searches, social media brand posts, tweets and pins are terrific and free (advertising),"" said Darryl Randall, founder and owner of United States-based online platform SwissLuxury.com, which he said generates sales of about $10 million in good years. Another gray market dealer said he will sometimes withdraw watches if asked by manufacturers and that brands regularly offer U.S. dealers packages of 15 or 20 pieces at a discount. ""As much as the brands dislike us, we have more or less the same goals they have -- we also want to sell the goods and be able to make a profit,"" he said. Chinese demand for luxury timepieces boomed after the 2008/09 financial crisis, leading to a surge in production and retail prices. But demand has dropped sharply in the past two years as extremist attacks have deterred tourists from visiting Europe, where many of the watches are sold, and China has cracked down on luxury gift-giving by civil servants.It was difficult to rein in production when demand fell, partly because the watches are put together slowly in stages, meaning production plans are often made two years in advance.Nobody needs a luxury product, but the brands find that when customers see and touch an intricately crafted watch in an opulent boutique and are drawn into its ""story"", they will want it so much that the price becomes secondary. MIXED AVAILABILITYIn the good times, the industry can take home 20 percent of sales as profit and retailers are still left with an attractive margin of up to 45 percent. But when business tails off, the manufacturers do not allow official retailers to cut sticker prices too far, fearing that big discounts will damage their brands -- a policy that may push cash-strapped retailers to sell to the gray market.Swiss watch exports fell 8 percent in the first two months of this year, on top of a 10 percent drop last year.In the gray market sales are often clinched in small, shabby stores or via online platforms that do not have most of the watches in stock and source them only when orders are placed. Randall said that brands vary in their efforts to keep products out of the gray market. Some of the hardest to source are Patek Philippe and Richard Mille, which both keep a tight rein on production. Audemars Piguet, another independent brand, only distributes certain models through its own boutiques.""Brands like (Swatch's) Omega and (LVMH's) Tag Heuer are easily available at all times,"" Randall said. The unnamed U.S. gray market dealer agreed and said that Richemont's Jaeger-LeCoultre and Vacheron Constantin and Swatch's Breguet are also easy to source.The United States is the second-biggest market for Swiss watches and is a hub for gray market watches, with online platforms such as Jomashop.com, AuthenticWatches.com and PrestigeTime.com. ""There's a lot of gray market watches coming in from outside the country. The excess of the world's products used to flow to Hong Kong, now it flows to the States,"" said Danny Govberg, an official U.S. retail partner for Switzerland's biggest brands but who also sells pre-owned watches online. He confirmed that brands sometimes offer him new pieces to sell as pre-owned but would not name them and said it was only a small share of his flourishing business. FROM ZURICH WITH A DISCOUNTThe gray market is by no means restricted to the United States. Germany's Chrono24.com has sales offices in both Hong Kong and New York, while a lot of gray market watches are also sold on Amazon (O:AMZN) and eBay (O:EBAY), the unnamed watch industry executive said.As its name suggests, there are no statistics on the gray market and few dealers are willing to explain how the system works.Unlike fakes, gray market watches are legal, authentic goods sold by their rightful owners, though they generally come without factory warranties because brands refuse to service watches that are not sold via their official networks.While that might deter some buyers, other more price-conscious shoppers may actually prefer the convenience of the online platforms that are tempting potential customers with trade-in schemes for old watches, financing solutions, price-match guarantees and their own warranty and service centers. Randall said he has been sourcing most of his watches in the United States to get them to customers quickly but can also find good deals in Europe thanks in part to the strong dollar. ""We just sold a beautiful Jaquet Droz Eclipse to a Chicago businessman and were able to get a great deal and quick shipment out of Zurich. The price was so good we gave him an additional $2,000 discount,"" Randall said, adding he sold the watch at 22 percent below the list price of $29,300.Saifullah Kazmi, from Karachi, said he bought a TAG Heuer Carrera at almost half price on Jomashop.com and had a relative bring it to Pakistan, where a local retailer confirmed that it was genuine. Kazmi was concerned at first about the legitimacy of Jomashop and the absence of a factory warranty, but the big discount tipped the scales, he said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

151,"Mar 24, 2017 11:50AM ET",From crepes to cocktails: can Grand Marnier's new owner make the leap?,nan,"By Francesca Landini and Maria Pia QuagliaMILAN (Reuters) - Italian drinks group Davide  Campari  (MI:CPRI) has a tall order to fulfill: take a neglected old liqueur out of the kitchen, where it is used as a dessert topping, and turn it into a hot new cocktail trend.Grand Marnier, a 137-year-old French brand that Davide Campari bought for 652 million euros ($700 million) last year, was once a drink for the wealthy, a meld of cognac and oranges that was sipped by first-class passengers on the Titanic.Today, in its European home market, it is more often tucked away in kitchen cabinets than featured prominently in trendy bars, and its return to the cocktail circuit is not assured, even for a company that has a record of reviving faded brands.Grand Marnier sales have fallen around 2 percent in the past three years and Davide Campari expects them to flatline for two years before picking up in 2019. Based on the latest six-month data, annual sales of the brand are running at around 160 million euros, making it the company's fifth biggest brand.The stakes are high for the world's sixth largest premium spirit maker, which bought the French liqueur last June in its biggest-ever acquisition. The price included assumed debt and represented more than a tenth of Davide Campari's market value.Industry analysts say they are confident the company can restore Grand Marnier's fortunes but say it could be costly and take time, a brake on profit margins. A prolonged stagnation of Grand Marnier sales could also slow down the company's acquisition strategy, vital to compete with much bigger rivals.The group's debts, in proportion to core earnings, are manageable but higher than the average of its main rivals after making more than 2 billion euros in acquisitions in 22 years. Euromonitor analyst Jeremy Cunnington thinks it should take a break from acquisitions and develop its newly acquired brands.That all adds up to pressure to revive Grand Marnier, the biggest challenge yet for Chief Executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz.He must shake off the liqueur's reputation in Europe as a fancy dessert topping and introduce it to more drinkers in America, its biggest market even though it is relatively little known there.""In Europe the challenge is making the leap from the kitchen to the glass, while in the Unites States the issue is more of increasing the glasses drunk,"" Kunze-Concewitz told Reuters. The CEO declined to give his target for Grand Marnier but the company aims to grow sales across all its brands by 5 percent in the medium term. Investment bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) says that implies Grand Marnier reaching around 5 percent growth by 2020.However, it took Kunze-Concewitz six years to shift the group's signature red aperitif, Campari, up a gear and accelerate the drink's growth from 3.5 percent in 2007, when he took the helm, to the high single digits by 2013.""Someone says Grand Marnier is an old brand but ... three out of four consumers have never tasted it. This is a great opportunity, like it was for the re-launch of Campari,"" he told Reuters, adding that the company's last brand makeover, of Appleton rum, took just three years.Kunze-Concewitz, a multi-lingual Austrian who was actually born in Turkey, expects Grand Marnier's sales to rise in value but not in volumes this year in the United States, while a return to growth in Europe will take longer.BANKING ON THE B-52 Davide Campari will start its offensive in America's biggest cities this year, with young drinkers and also bar managers such as 32-year-old Isaac Flores of Dick & Janes, a trendy cocktail bar in Brooklyn, New York.Flores rarely uses Grand Marnier and says brand recognition is just one of the problems to tackle. Retailing at $47 a bottle, it makes for an expensive cocktail.""Cocktails including it should cost at least $15-16 compared to $13 I charge the cocktails I craft,"" said Flores. ""Grand Marnier is a beautiful liqueur, which is best drunk on its own.""Since he was appointed CEO at the family-controlled spirit company, CEO Kunze-Concewitz has bought 14 brands, boosting sales by 80 percent in 10 years. But debt has trebled over that time to more than 1 billion euros, or 2.9 times its core profit against an average of 2.6 for Campari's main rivals.The company plans to launch new long drinks and capitalize on the revival of classic cocktails that feature the liqueur, such as Grand Margarita and B-52.It has tightened its grip on Grand Marnier's distribution, strengthening ties with Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits in the United States, and dropping third-party distributors and rivals Moet Hennessy (PA:LVMH) and  Diageo  (L:DGE).Davide Campari did not say how much it would spend on marketing Grand Marnier but the CEO said, overall, advertising and promotion expenses would rise by 20-25 basis points to just over 18 percent of sales, a level above the sector average.Grand Marnier's main rival in the United States is Remy Cointreau's (PA:RCOP) eponymous liqueur which has a smaller market share but has long set a faster pace in terms of sales.Davide Campari plans to hold tasting events in bars to show drinkers the difference between the two.But food and beverage expert Vittoria Veronesi, of Milan's Bocconi University, says it should not take Grand Marnier out of the kitchen altogether.""It would be fun to create new dishes and match them to a Grand Marnier-based aperitif, putting together the work of the chef with that of the barman.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

152,"Mar 23, 2017 04:30PM ET",Swiss watchmakers expect challenging U.S. market this year,nan,"By Silke KoltrowitzBASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers expect the market to stay challenging this year with the United States, their second-biggest market, showing no signs of recovering, executives told Reuters at an industry fair in Basel.Swiss watchmakers are grappling with declining sales in their biggest markets -- Hong Kong and the United States -- and have been hit by tourist shoppers avoiding Europe for fear of extremist attacks.The trend for shopping online has also kept buyers out of stores, said Efraim Grinberg, chairman and chief executive of  Movado Group Inc . (MGI) (N:MOV). ""We see a significant retail shift, especially in the U.S. The acceleration of the digital shift over the last five years has led to less traffic to retailers,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.""You're seeing some adjustments, but they'll take time to materialize. Retailers have to up their game to make venues more exciting and there's also a shift to online sales,"" he said, adding he didn't see that resolving very quickly.Shipments of Swiss watches fell 8 percent in January and February, dragged down notably by a 12.4 percent decline in the United States, where shipments also dropped 9 percent last year. U.S.-based MGI, whose brands include Swiss labels Movado and Ebel, on Monday reported a decline in sales and profits for the fiscal year to Jan. 31 and said it expected a mid single-digit drop in sales this year.Ricardo Guadalupe, head of LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Hublot brand, said U.S. sales were flat for the brand so far this year. ""The Americans don't have the same luxury watch culture, it's not like in China where people love mechanical watches,"" he said.Laurent Dordet, at the helm of Hermes' (PA:HRMS) watch business, said sales were improving at Hermes boutiques, but multibrand retailers were still facing difficulties in many markets, notably the United States, due to excess stock.Industry major Swatch Group (S:UHR) gave a more optimistic forecast last week, forecasting a 7-9 percent rise in sales for 2017.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

De Beers said in a statement that fully integrating De Beers Diamond Jewellers would enable the group to enhance value.Anglo American, which along with other mining companies has largely recovered from a deep commodities downturn in 2015, has put diamonds, along with copper and platinum, at the heart of its portfolio.One of the advantages of diamonds is that they are a counter-cyclical luxury product that can generate profits even when bulk industrial commodities are in a downturn.De Beers Diamond Jewellers' retail network comprises 32 stores in 17 countries. This includes a growing business in greater China, an established presence in London and Paris, and a new flagship location in New York.In addition, De Beers' Forevermark high-end diamond brand has expanded into 2,000 outlets globally and it says it expects the growth to continue this year.Analysts said LVMH had finally ended a joint venture that dated back to when the group did not have any branded jewelry of its own.""The situation is very different today, as they own one of the megabrands in this space: Bulgari,"" Luca Solca, analyst at Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), said.""It seems appropriate therefore to turn the page on this and relegate it to the 'experiments that didn't work' pile.""Anglo American shares were 1.4 percent higher by 1200 GMT (8 a.m. ET) while LVMH was up 0.6 percent.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

155,"Mar 14, 2017 11:55AM ET",Connected or mechanical? TAG Heuer tries to bridge gap with module watch,nan,"By Silke KoltrowitzBRUNNEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer, owned by LVMH (PA:LVMH), sought to appeal to tech geeks and traditionalists alike on Tuesday by launching a connected watch that lets wearers switch between a smart watch head and a traditional mechanical movement.Watch exports fell some 10 percent last year as sales of traditional Swiss timepieces slowed.But Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH's watch business, said: ""We're seeing a really spectacular rebound in mainland China, and this, thanks to tourism, is helping other markets as well."" TAG Heuer's connected watch looks traditional. But the round watch case, containing the module that displays the time and information from the applications installed, can be unfastened from the watch strap and replaced with a separately sold watch case which looks almost identical, but has a traditional dial instead of a screen and contains a traditional mechanical watch movement. TAG Heuer is trying to overcome the apparent contradiction between Swiss mechanical watches -- powered by gearworks invented centuries ago and designed to last decades -- and the latest technology to win new customers.Biver, launching TAG Heuer's second-generation connected watch in Brunnen, was echoing comments by Swatch Group (S:UHR) Chief Executive Nick Hayek in a newspaper interview.Biver said TAG Heuer aimed to sell 150,000 pieces in 2017 and would launch a smaller unisex version in October. Despite an investment of over 10 million Swiss francs ($10 million), the connected watch was profitable, he said, adding TAG Heuer had sold 56,000 pieces of the first-generation connected watch.Thanks to a technology transfer from partner  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), the watch can be assembled in Switzerland, thus qualifying for the traditionally coveted ""Swiss Made"" label.The basic TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 will cost $1,650 for a watch module based on Google's (O:GOOGL) Android Wear 2.0, with a built-in GPS and NFC contactless payment chip. An extra $4,000 can buy a mechanical watch module and a more expensive version is also available. Market research firm Strategy Analytics estimates that 21 million smartwatches were sold in 2016. During the fourth quarter, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch took 63 percent of the smartwatch market, or 5 million devices. Samsung (KS:005930) was second with 10 percent, down from 16 percent in the year-ago quarter.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

156,"Feb 28, 2017 06:27AM ET",France: Reasons to be bullish despite election stress,nan,"By Leigh ThomasPARIS (Reuters) - If financial markets are a guide, France is facing a perilous period of turbulence and uncertainty as the presidential election nears. But the underlying economy is telling a different story.While France's bond yields have spiked and its stocks have trailed the rest of the euro zone, as investors run scared of political risk, the country's economic prospects are actually looking up.French business confidence, consumer confidence and job creation are surging, while earnings expectations for big French companies are also improving. Whoever wins May's election - whether it be conservative Francois Fillon, far-right leader Marine Le Pen or centrist Emmanuel Macron - will start their five-year term with hiring at a decade high and the sluggish economy finally strengthening.Ironically they may have predecessor Francois Hollande to thank, as his business-friendly reforms could be bearing fruit at last - too late for the man whose failure to turn the economy around helped make him the most unpopular president in modern French history and pushed him towards the political exit.For a factbox on past reforms click For some large international investors, any risk aversion to France offers buying opportunities for stocks underpinned by robust fundamentals.""When markets apply a blanket negative response to an issue like France, we can come in and benefit our shareholders,"" said Steve Caruthers, an investment specialist in Los Angeles with Capital Group Companies Inc, which manages $1.4 trillion.""We have lots of companies within France that we have high conviction in today. They offer attractive valuations, certainly, compared to a lot of their U.S. competitors,"" said Caruthers, whose firm holds stakes in Airbus (PA:AIR), spirits maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH). POLITICAL RISKOther bond and stock market investors fear the global populist revolt that propelled Brexit and Donald Trump could sweep Le Pen to power. A scandal over Fillon's payments of state money to family members has left the election with no clear favorite. Though polls put Le Pen in the lead to win the Apr. 23 first round of the two-round election, either Fillon or Macron are seen easily beating her in a May 7 runoff.She has however narrowed the gap with her rivals in second-round voting intention surveys, a development which last week drove the premium that investors demand to hold French over German debt to highs not seen since late 2012. ""Le Pen's campaign is gaining traction and we can't ignore that, even though her victory is hardly anybody's main scenario,"" said Hideo Shimomura, chief fund manager at Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management. Japanese investors, traditionally big buyers of French debt, have been net sellers in recent months, according to official data.Some funds say this is more about Japanese investors staying home as long-term yields rise there. Shimomura said that many Japanese institutional investors could also not buy ahead of their book-closing at the end of March.Meanwhile, French bond futures (FOATc1) - used to hedge risk and trade market swings - have seen record interest this month, while some equity investors have been looking for hedges against volatility around the election in put and call options.French stocks have also become the least preferred by portfolio managers in Europe, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey. France's CAC-40 blue-chip index is largely flat since the start of this year, while the Stoxx Europe index of euro zone shares has gained 2 percent. http://reut.rs/2kGj1GTThis is despite improving earnings expectations for French companies; the number of analysts upgrading their earnings expectations for the country's firms is now higher than the number downgrading for the first time since mid-2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) put the probability of a Le Pen presidency at no more than 15 percent, in a research note on Thursday, saying markets were overestimating the likelihood. REAL ECONOMYWhile markets stress about the election, business leaders appear largely unfazed, judging by the latest monthly purchasing managers surveys, which came in at a near six-year high. The surveys have exceeded expectations and, at least for the service sector, have surpassed levels seen in the stronger German economy on firming domestic demand. http://tmsnrt.rs/2mhcHWGEven the long-struggling industrial sector is picking up, with morale rising more than expected this month, according to a monthly survey from the INSEE statistics agency.Official data this month also showed the economy created jobs in the fourth quarter at the fastest pace in a decade thanks to the services sector, which is by far the biggest sector in France. http://tmsnrt.rs/2mhrTmJThe trend looks set to continue with the Labor Ministry reporting job vacancies running at a five-year high and employers planning on hiring a record 216,500 managerial level workers this year, according to the APEC association that represents them.The recovering economy could be down to Hollande's reforms over the past five years, which included a payroll tax credit scheme to boost firms profitability and looser labor market rules to encourage hiring, and are likely to benefit his successor.""Whatever party is elected, these measures will keep having a positive impact on (economic) activity,"" said economist Arthur Jurus at Switzerland's Mirabaud Asset Management.

157,"Feb 21, 2017 05:57PM ET",Tiffany adds three directors in pact with activist JANA,nan,"By Michael Flaherty(Reuters) - Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) on Tuesday struck a surprise deal with JANA Partners, an activist investor and now a shareholder, agreeing to add three directors to its board as the luxury retailer tries to entice younger shoppers and revive struggling sales. The deal with JANA jolted the company's stock and came before the market was even aware the hedge fund was a shareholder. JANA owns around 5 percent of the stock, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jana's precise plan for the company is not yet clear, though some analysts surmised that the $6-billion hedge fund may view Tiffany as a potential takeover candidate.Tiffany, whose jewelry is a status symbol and popular among A-list celebrities and politicians, said on Feb. 5 that CEO Frederic Cumenal was stepping down amid disappointing results. Chairman and previous CEO Michael Kowalski was named interim chief executive while the company searched for someone to fill the role.As part of the deal with JANA, the three new board seats will go to Francesco Trapani, the ex-CEO of luxury retailer Bulgari; Roger Farah, co-chief executive of luxury brand Tory Burch; and James Lillie, a former CEO of consumer products company Jarden Corp. Trapani and Lillie both have a history of dealmaking. Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL) bought Jarden, the maker of Yankee Candle and Crock-Pot cookware, in April 2016 when Lillie was CEO.Trapani, who will be part of Tiffany's CEO search committee, was the CEO of Bulgari when LVMH agreed to buy the company for $5 billion. ""With the company now looking for a new CEO and today’s news in mind, we think (Tiffany’s) strategic prospects have improved,"" said Don Bilson, head of research at event-driven research firm Gordon Haskett. Bilson said Tiffany could be a takeover target for European luxury retailers such as  Richemont  (S:CFR),  Kering  SA (PA:PRTP) or LVMH (PA:LVMH). Shares of Tiffany closed up 2.6 percent at $88.41, reaching its highest level since August 2015.JANA is not the first activist in Tiffany's stock. Trian Partners sold out of most of its position in 2012 and fully exited the stock last year. Trian co-founding partner Peter May remains on the company's board. LADY GAGA Tiffany said in January its sales during the November-December holiday period were ""somewhat lower"" than it had expected, hurt by lower consumer spending and a drop in sales at its flagship store in New York. Tiffany's jewelry remains coveted by well-to-do baby boomers who made the brand synonymous with weddings and anniversaries, but it's struggling to attract younger shoppers. The New York-based retailer, with a market value of $11.1 billion, signed on pop star Lady Gaga to appear in an advertisement during the Super Bowl earlier this month - the same event where she was the featured singer at the U.S. football extravaganza's halftime show.Last month, Tiffany said it appointed  Coach  (N:COH) creative director Reed Krakoff as Chief Artistic Officer, a newly created position.Still, the moves to kick-start sales and seek a new chief executive were not enough to keep JANA from pouncing on the stock.JANA's quarterly filing, disclosed last week, had showed no sign of Tiffany shares as of Dec. 31, meaning the market was not even aware that JANA was an investor until Tuesday's announcement, which said JANA and Trapani own 5.1 percent of the company. JANA owns the majority of that position, a person familiar with the matter said.Tiffany's board will increase to 13 seats from ten.The deadline for Tiffany shareholders to nominate directors for its board at the annual meeting is Feb. 25.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

158,"Feb 09, 2017 12:42PM ET","In French bellwether city, scandal deepens election uncertainty",nan,"By Patrick VignalCHARTRES, France (Reuters) - Chartres has in past decades been a bellwether for France's presidential elections, but ahead of this spring's poll the signal from this white-collar city appears to be blurred by a scandal that has fed into a wave of anti-establishment feeling.In at least the past four elections, the affluent city famous for its towering thirteenth century gothic cathedral has voted in close alignment with the final national result.Lying in the Beauce plain 90 km (56 miles) southwest of Paris, Chartres counts perfume makers including Guerlain (PA:LVMH) and Danish pharmaceutical firm  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) as local companies. It should be a fertile ground for center-right challenger Francois Fillon.The 62-year-old former prime minister's clean-cut, clean-living image had held appeal in Chartres, run for over 15 years by a conservative mayor. But embarrassing revelations that his family for years benefited from large parliamentary salaries have hurt that image. In a Reuters poll of 100 people in Chartres city center, more than half said their vote was undecided. The survey intends to provide a snapshot of views in a single location and is not intended to reflect nationwide opinions. For many in Chartres, the Fillon debacle was a factor behind their indecision.""We are living at a time when the word integrity is becoming meaningless for our politicians. We've had some blatant examples in the past week"", 86-year-old Maurice Beauzac told a Reuters multimedia team.Fillon looked a shoo-in for the Elysee palace before the scandal surfaced two weeks ago, campaigning on a free-market platform to reduce regulation and haul down the stubbornly high unemployment rate.Now opinion polls suggest he will crash out in the first round. So too will the candidate of the ruling Socialist Party, Benoit Hamon, the surveys indicate, as mainstream parties battle against a rising tide of populism across Europe.The favorites to reach the runoff vote on May 7 are the far-right National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen, and independent challenger Emmanuel Macron who has yet to release a full manifesto. Among those polled by Reuters in Chartres, 25 percent said unemployment was their number one concern, while 19 percent named a lack of integrity, or honesty, as their main worry.For a graphic on the Reuters poll: http://tmsnrt.rs/2kras5jFor a photo essay: http://reut.rs/2k3TE0J For an online video: http://reut.rs/2kqsmT3""FED UP""The high level of uncertainty in Chartres underlines how wide open the presidential race remains. It also points to the disaffection many voters feel towards the political elite.""People are becoming less and less interested in politics,"" said Sebastien  Renault  (PA:RENA), a 35-year-old florist. ""It's a world of sharks out there, one eating the other.""It is a sentiment that will worry the main political parties, especially in a place where unemployment runs almost two points below the national average of nearly 10 percent, and a median annual salary of 30,000 euros places it in the top 10 for cities of its small size.""Like France, Chartres is fed up with the traditional political system but it's not only linked with the recent affairs,"" said Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges. ""It's just that the situation in this country has been deteriorating for the past 40 years. Almost everybody has somebody in his family who is out of work.""France's outgoing president, Francois Hollande, was elected in 2012 on a promise to create jobs, winning the hearts of socialists by declaring banks to be his ""main enemy"" and pledging extra taxes for millionaires. But he later launched reforms -- including cutting corporate taxes and legislation to make it easier for companies to hire and fire -- that traditional socialists viewed as a betrayal of left-wing values. Now it is the anti-European Union Le Pen who rails against free-trade who is pitching herself as the true defender of French workers' interests.Against this backdrop, some in the National Front are optimistic the party will get a boost from the Fillon scandal.""I think all of this clearly plays in Marine's favor,"" said Aleksandar Nikolic, the youthful head of the National Front's regional branch. Nikolic expressed surprise that immigration and security ranked low among the concerns of those polled by Reuters.""When we ask the people here what their main concerns are, security and immigration clearly come first,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

164,"Jan 12, 2017 01:20PM ET",Exclusive: Staff at French fashion house Lanvin fear job cuts as sales slump - sources,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Morale is low at Lanvin with staff expecting job cuts after France's oldest fashion brand swung into the red in 2016 and new designer Bouchra Jarrar failed to lift sales, sources told Reuters.The company appointed advisory firm Long Term Partners to conduct an audit and it is due to present its findings to Lanvin's board at the end of this month and recommend ways to reduce the company's cost base, the sources with first hand knowledge of the matter said. Founded in 1889, Lanvin is one of France's last major independent fashion brands, part of the country's fashion heritage, in the same league as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Christian Dior, Hermes (PA:HRMS) and privately owned Chanel.Lanvin expects to post a net loss of more than 10 million euros for 2016 - its first in nearly a decade - against a profit of 6.3 million euros in 2015, sources have said.Many items on its website are being offered at a 50 percent discount. Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company's woes stem in part from the uncertainty created by the arrival of its new designer, as well as the luxury spending downturn and underinvestment. Controlling shareholder, 75-year-old Chinese media magnate Shaw-Lan Wang who is based in Taiwan, has been reluctant to invest in the brand for many years. Wang would also not let her associate, private investor Ralph Bartel who owns 25 percent, inject more cash into the business as it would dilute her stake, the sources said. ""It is clear that the company's situation is deteriorating fast and now it is in a stalemate,"" one of the sources told Reuters.""But since Mrs Wang simply refuses to sell or (let the capital) be diluted, there is nothing we can do about it. It is so sad for the brand and its staff."" Wang shocked the fashion world in 2015 by sacking star designer Alber Elbaz after a boardroom dispute. Elbaz had been at the creative helm for 14 years and was frustrated by Wang's refusal to invest in Lanvin, particularly in areas crucial to growth such as new boutiques and accessories, several sources said. Lanvin declined to comment, while a spokesman for Wang said she was not available for comment and Long Term Partners did not return calls or emails asking for comment. DOWNWARD SPIRALLuxury analysts believe that Lanvin, had it benefited from more investment, has all it takes to become France's answer to Italy's Valentino, now generating more than 1 billion euros ($1.07 billion) in sales and preparing itself for a flotation. Instead, orders for new collections from multi-brand shops and department stores, which represent around 70 percent of Lanvin's turnover, fell 30-40 percent in the last half year. Overall, consolidated 2016 sales fell by more than 20 percent to below 170 million euros, from 210 million in 2015, several sources said. Designer Jarrar, appointed in March last year, presented at a show in September a Lanvin woman dressed in black and white tuxedos, very different from Elbaz's ethereal, light, ultra-feminine silhouettes adorned with clunky jewelry.DISPUTES At its peak in 2012, before Chief Executive Thierry Andretta, now CEO of Britain's Mulberry, resigned over strategic differences, revenue reached 235 million euros and the company's operating margins stood at around 10-12 percent. In 2015, Wang refused offers secured by Elbaz for Lanvin, including one of more than 400 million euros from Mayhoola, the Qatari firm that now owns Balmain and Valentino, sources said. Elbaz is still in legal proceedings with Lanvin and Wang over his dismissal and the value of his stake.Dozens of employees have resigned or been sacked and many former key staff are in legal fights, they said. Wang also sold off many of Lanvin's assets in the past decade, such as its Japanese operations to Japan's Itochu and its perfume business to Interparfums, which the brand can buy back in 2025.

168,"Jan 04, 2017 08:00AM ET",Louis Vuitton senior designer to take lead at French label Chloé: sources,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - French fashion house Chloé is set to name as it new creative director Natacha Ramsay-Levi, second-in-command to Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere, sources told Reuters, as the industry braces for a fresh round of leadership changes.After a year marked by a series of reshuffles at labels such as  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn), Kering's (PA:PRTP) Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga and LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Dior and Celine amid lower luxury spending, 2017 should see another round of musical chairs.The departure of Louis Vuitton's Ramsay-Levi raises questions about the future inner workings of the design studio, headed by Ghesquiere, who made his name at Balenciaga before joining Louis Vuitton in 2013.The appointment would also mean disruption for Richemont-owned Chloé (S:CFR), as Ramsay-Levi is associated with modern looks involving hard fabrics such as leather and synthetics, at odds with the label's traditional flowing romantic silhouettes. Citing the success of Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent and Demna Gvasalia at Balenciaga, fashion consultants argue that a new artistic direction, if thought out well, can be good for a brand because it gets consumers' attention and can help boost sales. Chloé's current creative director, Clare Waight Keller, a mother of three, decided not to renew her contract, which ends in March. Since her family moved back to London from Paris in June, she had been commuting between the two cities and wished to stop, the sources said. Analysts estimate Chloé, Richemont's (S:CFR) biggest fashion brand, generates sales of around 400 million euros ($417.20 million).  Richemont  and Chloé declined to comment. Industry sources have said Ghesquiere could end his collaboration with Louis Vuitton before his contract was up for renewal, which LVMH said was in 2018.Ghesquiere told French TV channel Canal Plus last year he wished to create his own label but did not provide details. In recent months, several fashion recruitment sources said Louis Vuitton executives were actively scouting for a replacement. LVMH and Louis Vuitton declined to comment on Ramsay-Levi's departure. THE GO-BETWEEN At Louis Vuitton, Ramsay-Levi was a key member of Ghesquiere's team. As design director, she was the only person the studio's designers and assistants regularly spoke to, as Ghesquiere rarely interacted with them directly, former studio employees told Reuters. Ramsay-Levi, who worked more than a decade with Ghesquiere at Balenciaga, on top of being his go-between, understood well his creative directions and translated them into concrete looks and products she asked designers to produce. There has been high staff turnover at Louis Vuitton's design studio the past two years, partly due to the brand's long working hours and stressful environment, former employees have told Reuters. Many studio staff are on three-month or one-month renewable contracts which prevents them from having days off or compensation for over-time.WWD reported last month that Ramsay-Levi was in talks with Chloé but it did not say Waight Keller had decided not to renew her contract.Waight Keller, who had joined Chloé in 2011 from Pringle of Scotland where she was artistic director and worked at Gucci, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), is parting ways on a high note, the sources said. Cartier owner Richemont said in November the French label ""enjoyed a geographically broad-based double-digit growth rate (in half-year sales), largely driven by leather,"" helped by the popularity of the Drew and Faye leather bags.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

169,"Dec 14, 2016 09:50PM ET",Lotte duty-free ambitions hinge on South Korea store license,nan,"By Joyce LeeSEOUL (Reuters) - Five bidders covet three lucrative downtown duty free licenses to be issued by South Korea on Saturday, and arguably none is more desperate for a win than Lotte Duty Free.The world's No.3 duty-free retailer's ambitions to one day become the world’s biggest operator were thwarted this year by a criminal investigation that forced its parent Lotte Group to scrap a multi-billion-dollar IPO.A win on Saturday would allow the beleaguered South Korean conglomerate to reopen a Seoul mega-store and revive its goal of global duty-free dominance. Failure would not only keep the store shuttered, it would curb enthusiasm for the planned $4.5 billion initial public offering of Lotte Group's hotel business, designed in part to help fund expansion in duty free. ""If Lotte is chosen, it's expected to have a positive influence on Hotel Lotte's planned IPO, which is the centrepiece of Lotte Group's announced target of turning into a holding company structure,"" said Yang Ji-hye, retail analyst for Meritz Securities.South Korea's customs agency will decide the winners of three new duty-free licenses for large companies in Seoul on Saturday, adding new stores to the world's largest duty-free market worth $7.9 billion last year.Other participants in the auction include Samsung (KS:005930) Group's  Hotel Shilla  Co Ltd (KS:008770) joint venture,  Shinsegae  Inc (KS:004170),  Hyundai Department  Store Co Ltd (KS:069960) and  SK Networks Co Ltd  (KS:001740).South Korea's fifth-largest business group, Lotte has invested a huge amount of energy in regaining the license that it failed to renew six months ago, around the time that prosecutors revealed they were investigating the group.Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, his father and 20 other current and former officials now face charges including embezzlement and breach of trust in one of the highest-profile investigations of a South Korea company's dealings in recent years.Shin, who denies any wrongdoing, unveiled a major restructuring of the conglomerate in October to boost confidence among consumers and potential investors.But the scandal had already derailed the hotel IPO just as money was draining out of the duty-free business. Lotte has bled 3 billion won ($2.6 million) a month since July to manage the now-empty Lotte World Tower store, which is about twice the size of a football pitch and once boasted about 700 brands including Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hermes.The closed store generated 611 billion won in revenue last year, about half the revenue raised by the vast mall surrounding the group's new Lotte World Tower skyscraper in Jamsil, southeastern Seoul, Lotte Duty Free says.The store is key to the group's ambition to become the world's biggest duty-free operator. Lotte Duty Free, with 3.75 billion euros turnover in 2015, is currently ranked third globally following Dufry and second-ranked DFS Group, a unit of LVMH (PA:LVMH).""We can reopen the store within a month because the space has been left open. All we have to do is shift the merchandise from our other locations,"" a Lotte Duty Free spokesman said. South Korea overtook the United Kingdom as the world's largest duty-free market in 2010, and has seen duty-free sales nearly double in the past four years to 9.2 trillion won in 2015.($1 = 1,163.3000 won)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

170,"Dec 09, 2016 09:34AM ET","Tag Heuer bucks downturn, expands in China: CEO",nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Tag Heuer's renaissance is far from over, its chief executive told Reuters, adding the high-end watch brand still had room to expand in China and other markets after some of the strongest sales growth in the industry this year.LVMH's (PA:LVMH) biggest watch brand in terms of sales has seen revenue growth of more than 10 percent so far in 2016, compared with a drop of more than 10 percent just two years ago, Jean-Claude Biver said in an interview. The revival was due in part to new models in its core price band of $1,000-$2,000 and the launch last year of its internet-connected watch, priced at $1,500, which helped burnish the Swiss brand's image, he said. The Swiss watch industry is mired in a downturn, having suffered more than two years of declining sales and with Swiss watch exports down 11 percent since the beginning of the year.First hit in 2012 by China's crackdown on gift giving to officials, it then suffered from various market shocks and a tourism slump after militant attacks in Europe in 2015 and 2016.""For us, China is a country where historically we were not very present, so it is huge opportunity,"" said Biver, an industry veteran credited with reviving Hublot and Swatch's Blancpain before being drafted in by LVMH boss Bernard Arnault in 2014 to turn around Tag Heuer and head LVMH's watch division.Biver said Tag Heuer this year had become a sponsor of the China National Space Agency, China's national soccer team and its captain, as well as England's Manchester United and Premier League, which were popular in China as well. ""We are investing massively in China while the others are cutting their investments,"" he said. The brand opened around 60 points of sale in China this year, including boutiques and corners in department stores as well as in multi-brand retailers, and plans to expand there at around the same pace next year.""This is going to drive our growth in 2017,"" Biver said. For next year, Biver said he wanted to be conservative in light of unpredictable global trends, forecasting Tag Heuer sales would rise by a single-digit percentage.While many rivals such as Richemont were cutting staff, Biver said Tag Heuer had hired 100 people this year. The brand sold 50,000 connected watches in 2016 and he expected 150,000 next year, as production is expanded. Biver said LVMH sister brand Hublot, with average watch prices at 18,000 euros ($19,000), was also among the few Swiss watchmakers enjoying growth, with sales up by a single-digit percentage in 2016.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

171,"Dec 04, 2016 12:21AM ET",No price like home: Big spenders reappear in China,nan,"By Jackie Cai and Jake SpringSHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's wealthiest shoppers are spending at home again, roused from a three-year slumber by a weaker yuan, lower prices and a crackdown on overseas sales agents - a welcome boost for the world's luxury brands. China's rich make up almost a third of the world's luxury shoppers, up from only 2 percent around the turn of the millennium. They are a driving force for global luxury, even after a slight dip this year when fewer traveled abroad, in part due to militant attacks in Europe. For the past three years, a crackdown on corruption and ostentation by President Xi Jinping dampened sales: big names such as LVMH (PA:LVMH), owner of Louis Vuitton, shuttered stores, particularly in second- and third-tier cities. In 2016, however, fashion houses, jewelers and buyers say that is changing, as China tries to shift away from an economy driven by heavy investment in infrastructure and encourages consumers to shop. Burberry  (L:BRBY), Gucci-owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP), and Tiffany (N:TIF) have all reported an uptick in their most recent China earnings, striking a note of optimism as the industry enters its critical weeks between the Christmas rush and Chinese New Year.""Everyone is benefiting from more traffic at the Chinese (luxury) shops,"" said Bruno Lannes, a Shanghai-based partner with consultancy Bain. It estimates a four-percent increase in mainland China sales after three years of decline.""Some brands in China are expecting 2016 to go back to their peak in 2012, though the mix is different. I expect some brands will beat that record,"" Lannes said.SHOPPERS FOR HIREOn the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, shoppers say they are, indeed, splashing out more often at home.The depreciating yuan means the currency doesn't buy as much abroad, while luxury brands such as Chanel have moved since last year to narrow once huge differences between prices in China and overseas. At the same time, the government has cracked down on daigous, shoppers-for-hire who trade off that price imbalance and buy goods more cheaply overseas for mainland Chinese.""Some brands price their products in China closer to the overseas markets, such as Chanel,"" said Emma Yu, a 32-year-old housewife exiting a Cartier store while shopping for a handbag in Shanghai's financial district. ""If there's only a few thousand yuan difference, I would just buy it at home."" Another shopper outside a Louis Vuitton store in central Shanghai, an accountant at a multinational who gave her surname as Lu, said she was also buying more at home, especially if not traveling. ""I definitely bought more luxury items at home than in the past since last year - a lot more - because it's convenient to buy things here,"" she said, standing with a friend as she compared a $5,700 purse she had bought with one in the shop window.BEARING FRUITMainland China has been seeing positive sales for a while, Johann Rupert, chairman of Compagnie Financiere  Richemont  (S:CFR), told investors last month.""It seems that the Chinese government's intent to promote growth through consumption rather than just investment is bearing fruit,"" Rupert said.Richemont, the owner of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and a dozen other luxury brands, reported ""marked"" October sales growth in mainland China in its presentation to investors.Kering, owner of Gucci and Saint Laurent, reported Asia Pacific sales were up 24 percent in the third quarter as many Chinese buyers stayed home. Burberry reported a double-digit increase in China in the second quarter, excluding the impact of changes to its offerings in Beijing.Local brands have benefited less, analysts say. A spokesman for jeweler Chao Tai Fook (HK:1929) said sales in greater China stabilized in September and October compared to declines in the previous two quarters.The picture is also less rosy in Hong Kong, once the prime destination for Chinese shoppers wanting to avoid the hefty taxes of mainland without requiring extensive travel. Even so, after drops of over 20 percent a year in the last two years, sales have stabilized, analysts and luxury companies said.Mainland shoppers willing to splash out abroad, and wanting a more original high-end experience, prefer to go to Japan, Europe or even Macau, said Mariana Kou, an analyst at investment bank CLSA. Tax incentives are no longer enough.""Hong Kong has become a bit boring,"" Kou said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Analysts had on average forecast 1 percent growth in sales for 2017.Shares in Hugo Boss, which have rallied 14 percent in the last month after it and other luxury fashion companies signaled a recovery in China, fell 6 percent by 0923 GMT, making them the biggest fallers among German mid-cap stocks (MDAXI).Since Langer took over, the stock has narrowed its discount to luxury peers, trading at 17.3 times forward earnings, compared with 19.3 times for sector leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) and 17.7 times for  Burberry  (L:BRBY). Boss said it will continue to bring the prices of its goods in different regions in line, leading to further cuts in Asia and a slight rise in Europe, while prices should stay stable in North America. Despite price cuts in China, a suit that costs 500 euros ($535) in Germany still costs 900 euros in China. The firm said the BOSS Orange and BOSS Green labels - the former more fashion-focused and the latter inspired by sports - would no longer be continued as separate brands, but would be integrated into its main BOSS line.Its HUGO line aimed at a younger, more fashion conscious customer will be priced at roughly a third less than the BOSS brand by the time of its Spring 2018 collection.Langer had already announced plans to return Hugo Boss to its roots selling smart men's suits, cutting costs and shutting stores. Under Lahrs, the company opened more than 400 stores worldwide and had invested heavily in womenswear.Boss said that womenswear would remain an important part of the business, and is continuing its collaboration with designer Jason Wu. However, the group will only present its menswear collection at the New York fashion week next year.Boss reiterated that it would slow down the store openings, moving more of its business to online. It also plans to lift productivity in its retail business by around 20 percent over the next few years.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

176,"Nov 03, 2016 10:10AM ET",Strong Hermes sales confirm China-fueled luxury revival,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - Hermes (PA:HRMS) confirmed stronger-than-expected global demand for luxury goods on Thursday, joining luxury goods industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) in outshining third quarter results forecasts.A sales rebound in mainland China, improvements in Hong Kong, a British surge thanks to a weaker pound and relative U.S. resilience despite the stronger dollar have all lifted luxury stocks including LVMH, Kering, Hermes,  Richemont  (S:CFR),  Burberry  (LA:BRBY) and  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) in the past month.Chinese customers, the biggest buyers of luxury goods who make up more than a third of global demand, have been re-opening their wallets, luxury groups said, spurred in part by government policies encouraging local consumption.""The driving trend is that the Chinese customer is slowly coming back,"" Makiko Zuercher, who manages the 22-million euro Dynapartners Luxury Brands Fund, said. These positives now outweigh concerns about lower tourist traffic in Europe, due to the attacks on Paris, and the drop in purchasing power among Russian, Middle East and Brazilian consumers after the depreciation of their currencies. ""Many of the psychological catalysts which dampened luxury demand - starting with the renminbi deterioration in August 2015 and including attacks in Paris in November 2015 - have now been shrugged off,"" HSBC said in a note. ""Every market, with the possible exception of Japan, is doing better or in line with previous trends.""The broker said luxury stocks had been sold ""short"" by hedge funds, a trade showing they expect the price to fall, and largely ignored by ""long-only"" institutions for many months.The one luxury stock for which there is still shorting interest is Cartier owner Richemont, which makes half of its sales from watches, the luxury sector's most depressed segment. Data from Astec Analytics shows Richemont has the highest ""short"" interest. It is also one of the few luxury stocks still down for the year to date and analysts are not expecting any upbeat comments when it publishes its trading update on Friday. Kering is easily the best performer this year, and short-sellers have very low positions in the stock.Fund managers and buy-side analysts said investors needed to be remain selective as some brands such as Prada (HK:1913) and Tod's (MI:TOD) could continue to suffer in the near term from competition from more innovative rivals. Recent trading updates showed that sales growth in the sector could only be achieved through market share gains as the past levers to boost revenues such as opening new shops and lifting prices were no longer available.Hermes beat market expectations with a 8.8 percent rise in third-quarter sales at constant currencies, above analysts' 7 percent forecast, helped partly by China's rebound.Last month industry leader LVMH, regarded as a proxy for the sector, and later Kering, saw their shares soar after their respective Louis Vuitton and Gucci brands published much stronger than expected sales.""Who would have expected two years ago Gucci's recovery would be so strong,"" said Scilla Huang, manager of the Julius Baer Luxury Brands Fund, with 200 million euros under management.    ""They made courageous efforts and people were hungry for that kind of newness.""    /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Consob also said it had fined Sonvico 350,000 euros. Belloni denies the charges against him and LVMH said he would appeal the Consob decision. ""Mr. Belloni notes the administrative decision by Consob which he has decided to appeal, challenging all aspects of the charges against him,"" Belloni's lawyers said. No-one at Pentagram was immediately available to comment. Sonvico did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to comment via Linkedin.Consob also said Belloni was barred from holding any management role in a listed company for eight months.LVMH said that according to its French and Italian lawyers, none of the positions held by Belloni would be affected by the Consob decision.

178,"Oct 11, 2016 01:24PM ET",LVMH says no way will do business with Amazon,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt(Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH) said there was ""no way"" it would do business with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  even though the Internet retailer was keen to take on more high-end brands.Amazon currently sells mostly so-called ""accessible luxury"" brands such as Michael Kors, Calvin Klein and Kate Spade, but LVMH said it did not think it was an appropriate platform for its luxury brands.""We believe the business of Amazon does not fit with LVMH full stop and it does not fit with our brands,"" LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors in a conference call on Tuesday, after the group announced unexpectedly robust quarterly sales. ""There is no way we can do business with them for the time being.""Amazon has been growing its fashion, jewelry and watch retailing in recent years but failed to attract heavyweight luxury brands as they are concerned the U.S. retailer's product presentation and discounts could damage their image.LVMH and other luxury goods groups such as Chanel and  Richemont  (S:CFR) fought hard to obtain the right from the European Commission in 2010 to refuse partnering with certain websites, citing worries about pricing and counterfeits.LVMH's shares jumped by as much as 5.7 percent on Tuesday after the group reported much higher than expected third-quarter sales late on Monday, driven by strong trading at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand and revived demand from Chinese customers at home and abroad.LVMH's sales figures boosted investor sentiment toward the luxury sector, which has been relatively bearish in recent months, and lifted shares of peers such as Richemont, which gained more than 3 percent on Tuesday, and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), up 2 percent.There is concern that tourists will stay away from major European luxury markets in the near future following recent attacks, while an uncertain global economic outlook could also keep demand subdued. However, the group behind fashion brands Fendi, Dior and Guerlain perfume, said sales in mainland China had improved to ""mid teens"" in the third quarter from ""mid single digits"" in the first half. ""The Chinese customer (who represents one third of LVMH sales) is doing very well,"" Guiony told investors. Without the negative impact of phasing out the Donna Karan brand, organic growth at the group's all-important fashion and leather unit would have been more than 7 percent, rather than the 5 percent reported, Guiony told investors. LVMH's leading jewelry brand Bulgari had seen growth slow down as 2015 had been a bumper year, he said. LVMH shares, which have now risen more than 14 percent this year, closed 4.5 percent higher valuing the group at 80.2 billion euros.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

183,"Sep 02, 2016 10:04AM ET",Louis Vuitton targets middle-income shoppers with perfume launch,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton has launched its first perfume range since the founding merger of its parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) in 1987, targeting middle-income shoppers amid a downturn in luxury spending.This week's launch is an important step for the French brand as it tries to strike the delicate balance between increasing its number of more affordable goods while retaining its cachet.Until now, shoppers on more modest incomes have only been catered for by Louis Vuitton's key chains and very small leather goods, costing around 200-300 euros apiece.But the brand needs to boost sales growth after a sharp slowdown in the past three years, and with little sign of an industry recovery as security fears and geo-political uncertainty hit the tourism flows vital for luxury brands. Louis Vuitton's collection of seven perfumes, with names including ""turbulences"" and ""matiere noire"" or ""dark matter,"" are on sale for around 200 euros ($224) for a 100 ml bottle. That is close to the price of niche perfume brands such as By Kilian, which have been enjoying sales growth four to five times higher than big, traditional fragrance providers whose prices cost under 100 euros. Perfume has been more resilient to the industry downturn than some parts of the luxury market, with global sales estimated to have risen 2.9 percent to about 15 billion euros last year. Within that, sales by niche brands jumped about 15 percent to around 1 billion euros. At first, Louis Vuitton will sell the perfumes in only about 180 of its 460 stores. Analysts estimate they could generate 60-80 million euros of sales in the first year. By comparison, luxury giants such as Chanel and LVMH's Dior, whose products are much more widely distributed, make about 2.5 billion euros a year from perfumes and cosmetics. Louis Vuitton, which declined to say how much it has invested in the project, gave star industry ""nose"" Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud four years to prepare the launch. The perfumer, who worked for decades with fragrance producer Firmenich, created many commercially successful perfumes including L'Eau d'Issey for Issey Miyake and L'Oreal's (PA:OREP) Poeme for Lancome and Acqua di Gio for Armani. Some industry analysts said Louis Vuitton took its time with the launch partly out of concern the move could exacerbate its ubiquity problem - the result of having opened too many shops, which dented its perceived exclusivity.Since 2012, the brand has worked to remedy this by putting the brakes on expansion and elevating its market positioning by producing more expensive handbags, with many available only in limited numbers.

Kulkin will become a consultant to Coach.Kahn is currently CEO of Valentino, USA, a unit of Italian fashion house Valentino Fashion Group.She has previously held senior positions with France-based luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH) at brands including Marc Jacobs, Celine and Pucci, Coach said. ""(Kahn) is highly regarded as a brand champion and for her ability to drive growth in both wholesale and retail channels and across categories including footwear, apparel and accessories,"" Coach Inc CEO Victor Luis said in a statement.The $574 million acquisition of Stuart Weitzman has helped Coach beef up sales and expand its product offerings to better compete with rivals such as  Michael Kors Holdings  Ltd (N:KORS) and Kate Spade & Co (N:KATE). The business accounted for more than 8 percent of Coach's sales last quarter. Coach has been trying to claw back the premium tag it had lost due to an expansion spree that flooded the market with its bags, by cutting back on promotions and appointing well-known fashion designer Stuart Vevers as its creative head.The latest executive change comes a few months after the company said its chief operating officer and global marketing president were leaving.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

189,"Jul 11, 2016 01:10PM ET",Burberry to replace Bailey as CEO with Céline's Gobbetti,nan,"By James Davey and Astrid WendlandtLONDON (Reuters) - British luxury brand  Burberry  (L:BRBY) has recruited Marco Gobbetti, the Italian boss of French brand Celine, to succeed Christopher Bailey as chief executive next year, freeing Bailey to focus again on the design role that made his name.Bailey's dual roles of CEO and chief creative officer since May 2014 had worried some investors who felt he had too much on his plate. Burberry said he would retain his creative role and also take the title of president.Shares in the 160-year-old firm, down 24 percent over the last year, rose by up to 7.9 percent, their strongest day in three years.""It was clear that the 'dual role' solution was not working, and that both the business and the share price had suffered,"" said Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca.""This is a step forward for Burberry, where we perceived a need of reinvention and stronger direction.""The Paris attacks have deterred tourists and demand from major markets such as China has fallen, with global sales growth seen sinking this year to flat to low-single digits. In April the firm -- famous for its camel, black and red-checked designs -- reported a 10 percent fall in annual profit and said it would overhaul its business, shrinking its product range and focusing more on handbags. It also gave a bleak outlook for the current financial year.Burberry said Gobbetti, 57, currently Céline's chairman and CEO, will join in 2017 as soon as he is contractually able to.Under the creative stewardship of award-winning designer Phoebe Philo for the past eight years, Celine has been one of LVMH’s (PA:LVMH) fastest-growing and most successful fashion labels generating around 600 million euros ($660 million) in sales.EXPERIENCEGobbetti has over 20 years experience in the luxury industry and a track record of growing and developing brands including Givenchy, Moschino and Bottega Veneta, said Burberry.He will be responsible for all commercial, operational and financial elements of the business, working in partnership with Bailey, who will oversee all elements of brand and design.Among the highest-paid FTSE 100 bosses, Bailey will not be taking a pay cut.Analysts say Gobbetti’s main tasks will include giving more coherence to Burberry’s fashion identity and boosting the brand’s desirability.Celine is extremely profitable, market sources say: its strength is in leather goods where margins are the highest. Investors hope Gobbetti will bring the same touch to Burberry’s leather goods sales.Critics say some of Burberry's mistakes were self-inflicted, seeking to become a digital age trailblazer but paying too little attention to the substance of its fashion message.The firm has made destabilizing changes in recent months, including bringing all its sub labels such as Prorsum, Brit and London under one Burberry brand and regrouping its menswear and womenswear shows into one.It has also been working to get new clothing and accessories more quickly to customers.As part of its management shake-up, Burberry also said it had appointed Julie Brown to the new role of Chief Operating & Financial Officer.Brown, who is currently CFO at medical technology business Smith and Nephew (L:SN), will join in early 2017 at the latest.Current CFO Carol Fairweather will step down from the board by the end of January 2017 ""to pursue new opportunities"". Burberry is due to release a quarterly trading update on Wednesday.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

190,"Jun 23, 2016 10:20AM ET",Exclusive: Dior to appoint Valentino's Maria Chiuri as creative head - sources,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) -  Christian Dior  (PA:DIOR) is set to announce after its couture show in early July that Maria Grazia Chiuri is joining the French fashion house from Italy's Valentino, two people familiar with the matter said. Chiuri will be taking on one of the most important jobs at Dior. She will also be the first woman creative director in the company's 70-year history, following in the footsteps of celebrity designers including Yves Saint Laurent, Gianfranco Ferre and John Galliano. ""I understand that it will be announced after the (July) couture show,"" one of the sources said. Dior was not immediately available for comment. Chiuri will join Dior at a difficult time. The brand's fashion sales growth has dropped in the past year and a half, going from double-digit to flat sales growth in the first quarter of this year.Dior has attributed its poor results to the luxury market slowdown but some fashion industry experts have suggested it might be facing some desirability issues. Dior is the parent company of LVMH (PA:LVMH), the luxury industry's biggest luxury group. It generates around 5 billion euros in annual sales, of which more than three fifths come from perfume and cosmetics. It has been struggling to find a replacement for Belgian designer Raf Simons who left unexpectedly in October. Chiuri has worked wonders at Valentino together with her design partner Pierpaolo Piccioli, acting as the brand's joint-creative director since Valentino Garavani, who hired them himself, announced his retirement in 2007. The pair won several prizes and helped to turn Valentino into one of the luxury industry's most profitable luxury brands and one of the strongest in terms of sales growth.Under their creative leadership, Valentino has become known for its light, graceful and highly romantic designs, applauded by fashion editors. Dior, which has been producing relatively modern styles, would benefit from a return to more romantic, fairytale-like aesthetics, some fashion critics have said, when asked about Chiuri on an unattributable basis.Mayhoola, the Qatari investment company that owns Valentino, this week acquired the French fashion label Balmain, another fast-growing brand, for around 460 million euros ($524 million), three sources told Reuters on Tuesday.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

191,"Jun 21, 2016 03:44AM ET",Swiss watch industry exports continue to struggle in May,nan,"By John RevillZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's watch industry exports fell nearly 10 percent in May as watchmakers continued to struggle with the aftermath of last year's extremist attacks in Europe and a prolonged slowdown in Asia.Exports of timepieces fell 9.7 percent on a nominal basis to 1.55 billion Swiss francs ($1.61 billion), according to data released by the Swiss customs office on Tuesday.The fall followed declines of 11.1 percent in April and 16.1 percent in March. Overall this year Swiss watch exports, which are seen as a proxy for sales, have fallen by 9.5 percent.Particularly badly hit have been China and Hong Kong, two of the world's largest markets for luxury watches which are made by companies like Swatch (S:UHR),  Richemont  (S:CFR) and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH).Europe has also been struggling, with reduced tourism numbers in the wake of Islamist attacks last year reducing the number of visitors to important luxury shopping destinations like Paris.Exports to France fell 18.4 percent in May, according to figures from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.In response, watchmakers have been cutting costs and production as the industry faces its biggest slowdown since 2009 when the global financial crisis reduced demand for luxury watches.Last month, Geneva-based Richemont said it expected business to remain tough in the months ahead, as it reported a 1 percent fall in its constant sales for the 12 months ended March 31.The owner of Cartier and IWC brands said April had been particularly difficult with sales down 15 percent in the month when currency swings were removed.Difficulties in Richemont's watches business were exacerbated by inventories at retailers, which forced the company to buy back unsold watches. No further job cuts were planned on top of the 500 cut last year, but more stores could close in China, Richemont said last month.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Besides the existing hotels in Milan, London, and Bali, three further establishments are due to open in Shanghai, Beijing, and Dubai in 2017.Bulgari, the flagship jewelry brand of luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH), also has another four hotel projects, likely to be unveiled in the next few months, Babin said.""In the next decade, probably, we will open five more, the target being to be only in the most trend-setting cities or, like in Bali, in the most trend-setting resort locations in the world.

Bulgari Chief Executive Jean-Christophe Babin told Reuters in an interview the company's two Moscow outlets opened so far were ""a minimum"" even though some customers had become more cautious because of the weaker rouble.""Perhaps 10 years down the road we will have five-six boutiques in Russia: three (in) Moscow (or) four, perhaps; one in St Petersburg; and one or two in two other cities,"" he said at the company's second Russian store in central Moscow.

The United States and Cuba formally agreed to restore diplomatic relations last July.Despite the success in curbing grey market sales, the privately owned company expects slower sales growth this year, Pavlovsky told Reuters in Havana's landmark Teatro Marti. He declined to disclose figures.He noted that Chanel has an entire team, including external lawyers, that monitors the secondary market.The luxury goods industry been plagued in the last few months as a drop in global tourist traffic due to recent terrorist attacks, slower economic growth in China, and record low oil prices have dented the purchasing power of important luxury buyers from Russia and the Middle East.In April, industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) said its fashion and leather goods sales were flat while Hermes (PA:HRMS) said revenue growth slowed in the first quarter.Pavlovsky said fewer Russians were traveling due to the weak rouble, and Brazil's recession has curbed demand there.But Chanel was seeing solid growth in the United States, some parts of Europe such as Britain, Russia, China, Japan and Korea, he said. Chinese and Russians not traveling abroad as much were buying more at home.""There is a slowdown but not such a big slowdown,"" he said.Pavlovsky said Chanel was presenting its latest inter-seasonal Cruise line in Cuba because the country had inspired Karl Lagerfeld, the company's chief designer and creative director. Chanel, which began as a millinery store in 1909 in Paris, was also returning to its roots, he added.Founder Coco Chanel designed early collections for wealthy and glamorous Americans holidaying on yachts and cruises in the Caribbean. Cruises to Cuba had been forbidden during the country's standoff with the United States.Earlier on Monday, the first U.S. cruise ship to sail to the island in more than 50 years docked in Havana.Chanel, which has fewer than 200 boutiques worldwide, will not be setting up shop in Cuba any time soon, Pavlovsky said.""Why not, one day,"" he said.

Versace, known for its glittering evening gowns and medusa logo, has been going from strength to strength since flirting with bankruptcy in 2004 and could be headed for a stock market listing when market conditions improve.""I expect growth this year to be slightly below that of 2015,"" Versace Chief Executive Gian Giacomo Ferraris told Reuters in an interview on the fringes of the Conde Nast luxury conference. ""It will be a tough year.""Versace, still family-controlled with Donatella at the creative helm, saw revenue rise 8.6 percent in 2015 at constant exchange rates in the year to Dec. 31 to 645 million euros ($729 million).Its cautious outlook comes after several luxury groups including LVMH (PA:LVMH), Richemont (VX:CFR) and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) posted weak first-quarter sales, hit by lower tourist spending and depressed demand in key cities such as Hong Kong. Ferraris said business in Europe was growing mainly thanks to local consumers as there had been a drop in buyers from regions such as Russia and the Middle East. The chief executive credited with turning the company around and steering a course through family feuds, said next year was the earliest Versace could float as it had not started choosing advisers and not decided on where the shares would be listed. Rival Italian luxury brand Valentino has also said it was planning to float in 2017. U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (N:BX) bought a 20-percent stake in Versace in 2014. Ferraris said Versace was actively investing in social media and e-commerce, both in-house and with multibrand online retailers such as Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-a-porter. He said he was in Seoul to develop the brand's business in Korea, the world's biggest duty-free market and No.8 luxury goods market. On Thursday, he was on his way to Japan, where he also saw solid growth prospects. ""I am quite optimistic about our growth in Asia,"" he said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

The jewelry sector and particularly the best known brands have been bucking the luxury goods slowdown because their rare, high-end pieces are regarded as good investments with strong potential re-sale value at auctions.Demand from affluent Asian woman increasingly buying jewelry for themselves has also been driving up sales. LVMH does not publish figures for individual brands but its watches and jewelry unit, of which Bulgari makes up a significant proportion, were up 7 percent in the first quarter to 774 million euros, contrasting with fashion and leather sales which remained flat.Bulgari, whose jewelry items range from 1,000 to 10 million euros, has some 300 stores worldwide and plans to add around 12 stores in 2016, Babin said.Wealthy customers are whisked through the London store to private upstairs rooms where they can examine potential purchases. Babin, sporting a Bulgari watch, said he was also looking at expanding the company's small but fast growing e-commerce business, which currently operates in the United States and Japan, to drive further growth in countries such as China, Canada and Russia.(editing by Astrid Wendlandt and Keith Weir)          /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

201,"Apr 14, 2016 06:32AM ET",Clock ticking as Swiss watchmakers await market recovery,nan,"By Silke KoltrowitzLA CHAUX-DE-FONDS/LE LOCLE, Switzerland (Reuters) - In two small Swiss towns, watchmakers are trying to strike a balance as delicate as the mechanisms in their precision-engineered watches - squeezing suppliers to cope with an industry crisis while preserving the skills that drove past successes. La Chaux-de-Fonds, home to just 39,000 people, and even smaller neighbor Le Locle have been at the heart of the Swiss watchmaking industry since the 19th century.But after the boom years earlier this century, life has got much harder. Demand for traditional luxury watches has been hammered by a Chinese government crackdown on bribery, a drop in tourist shoppers to Europe and, at lower price points, the rise of smartwatches.Top manufacturers such as Swatch Group (S:UHR),  Richemont  (S:CFR) and LVMH (PA:LVMH) have responded by demanding price cuts from suppliers and taking more production in-house.That has hit hard in La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle, home to a network of industry subcontractors.""Some brands asked us to lower prices by 15 percent,"" said Alain Marietta, co-owner of Le Locle-based watch dial maker Metalem which employs around 250 people. ""That was not justified, but we did lower prices a bit and are taking a hit on our margin,"" he said, adding he expected sales to fall 10 percent this year, in line with 2015, and staff would likely have to work short hours in the second half. Francois Matile, secretary general of the watch industry employers' association, said about 1,000 jobs had been lost in about a year from the more than 59,000 in the Swiss watch industry. The actual figure was higher including temporary contracts not being renewed and staff attrition, he added. La Chaux-de-Fonds had a jobless rate of 8.1 percent in January, one of the highest in Switzerland. The watch industry accounts for the lion's share of its 11,000 industrial jobs.""IN THE SAME BOAT""But the big brands are wary of pushing too hard, as they still rely heavily on suppliers' know-how, often handed down to each new generation in small family-owned businesses.Despite the job losses, Matile said he knew of no company that had gone out of business in the industry. ""We are definitely all in the same boat. We wouldn't exist without this network of industry contractors and subcontractors,"" said Aldo Magada, chief executive of high-end brand Zenith, owned by LVMH, but headquartered in Le Locle where its more than century-old factory buildings are part of the UNESCO world heritage site stretching over the two towns.Manufacturers such as Zenith have been cutting prices in a bid to boost demand, which has hurt suppliers.But Metalem's Marietta said customers including Zenith, Chopard and IWC were making an effort to give work to subcontractors. ""Even the big groups will always keep part of the production with external suppliers because we are their safety valve,"" he said, noting top manufacturers would be even more exposed to swings in demand if they brought more production in-house.Horlyne, which employs around 30 people in La Chaux-de-Fonds and still uses the traditional decorative technique of engine-turning in which a precise, intricate pattern is mechanically engraved into an underlying material, said business was grim. ""We expect sales to fall 30-40 percent this year and started working shorter hours in March,"" said company owner Raymond Leitenberg, adding he hoped to break even this year.But he was confident that expertise and innovation would see the business through, having invested 600,000 Swiss francs in a new laser machine to be able to offer more decorations for Horlyne's flagship watch component called 'oscillating weights'. ""The Swiss watch industry is very dynamic when it comes to research, it is not resting on its laurels. The crisis is fuelling creativity,"" said Leitenberg.""We have reached a bottom, things have to improve, we just don't know when. We have to hold out until they do.""   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

204,"Mar 17, 2016 06:40PM ET",Swiss watchmakers face another challenging year,nan,"By Silke KoltrowitzBASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers are braced for another difficult year as economic woes in major markets curb consumers' appetite for pricey timepieces, industry executives said on Thursday.Sales in Hong Kong, the biggest market for Swiss watches, have been depressed as China's economic slowdown and Beijing's anti-corruption campaign have hurt spending by mainland Chinese, which shows no signs of rebounding.Zenith, the upmarket watch brand owned by LVMH (PA:LVMH), sells almost two out of three watches to Chinese customers.""2016 is very complicated because people no longer have the confidence needed to simply go and buy our products,"" Zenith's Chief Executive Aldo Magada told Reuters at the Baselworld watch fair.He said he could not rule out job cuts. As well as China's slowdown, tourism in Paris, another luxury goods hub, has been hit by the Islamist attacks in November, while Russians travel and spend less because of the weak rouble, the Ukraine crisis and the low oil price - which is also tempering luxury spending in the Middle East.Like other upscale brands, Zenith has expanded into more affordable watches to meet the demands of more price-conscious consumers, a trend already visible at January's Geneva watch fair dominated by luxury goods group Richemont's (S:CFR) high-end brands.""Our product mix has changed, we sell fewer gold watches, more steel,"" said Magada.Competition from smartwatches is also threatening the luxury watch sector.Among luxury giant LVMH's watch brands, Zenith has suffered the most with a single-digit decline in sales last year, whereas TAG Heuer and Hublot generated growth thanks to their smaller exposure to China, said LVMH watch and jewelry head Jean-Claude Biver.""The first quarter makes us think that we'll again outperform the market this year,"" Biver said, adding TAG Heuer was hiring staff to push ahead with its smartwatch project.Swiss watch exports, which reflect the value of watches leaving the country but give no indication on what has really been sold to end consumers, tumbled 7.9 percent in January year-on-year after falling 3.3 percent last year.""I'm hearing from peers that the overall situation has become rather more tense since the beginning of the year,"" said Laurent Dordet, head of Hermes' (PA:HRMS) watch business, who would not comment on his own company's performance this year. Tissot and Longines, Swatch Group's (S:UHR) mid-price luxury brands, had slightly negative to flat sales growth last year and see at best a slight improvement this year.Independent high-end label Patek Philippe, so sought-after by collectors that it can grow sales by 1-3 percent in good times and bad, says many luxury watchmakers made the mistake of focusing too much on China and Chinese travelers.""They went too quickly. Now stock levels are too high everywhere,"" said Patek Philippe president Thierry Stern.Shares of luxury watchmakers and their parent groups have been hit hard in the past year as sales have slowed. However, some analysts say selling may have been overdone as industry executives see some brightspots such as Japan and South Korea, which are drawing more Chinese tourists.Shares in Swatch, the world's biggest watchmaker, for example, fell 21 percent last year and are down a further 2 percent this year, while  Richemont  has shed 11 percent this year after sliding nearly 19 percent last year. ""There is of course the special case of Hong Kong, where a lot of wholesalers are still very cautious. Overall, however, the mood has become too negative,"" said Scilla Huang Sun, portfolio manager of the Julius Baer Luxury Brands fund.She forecasts 5 percent organic growth for luxury brands this year, but says most of that will come in the second half.For a graphic on the Swiss watch industry, click on this link: http://tmsnrt.rs/1XuXPjH  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

206,"Mar 09, 2016 02:35AM ET",Sharapova fallout shows sponsors have no tolerance for banned drugs,nan,"By Ben Klayman(Reuters) - In the day following Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova's admission that she failed a drug test, sponsors  Nike , Porsche and Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer dropped her like a hot potato.Before social media demanded instant responses, sponsors often waited weeks or months before severing ties with an athlete - giving them the benefit of the doubt. With so much invested in a global sponsorship industry IEG estimates at $60 billion, sponsors now scramble to avoid the taint of scandal so athletes caught doping at the Olympics this summer should also expect a quick end to their lucrative contracts. ""Given the attention that use of performance-enhancing drugs in just about all sports has garnered over the last several years, sponsors are going to cut as quickly as they can,"" said Brian Socolow, head of the sports practice group at Loeb & Loeb law firm, which has represented both athletes and companies in endorsement deals. ""They don't want to get caught sponsoring the next Lance Armstrong,"" he added, referring to the disgraced cyclist who was stripped of seven Tour de France titles and banned for life in 2012 after a U.S. anti-doping probe. Armstrong later admitted using performance-enhancing drugs in a television interview.While Armstrong's story took years to play out as he initially denied reports of his drug use, Sharapova quickly called a press conference on Monday to say she had tested positive for meldonium, which she said she was taking to treat diabetes and low magnesium. The drug was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1.Sports apparel giant Nike Inc (N:NKE) and German carmaker Porsche, a Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) unit, responded by suspending their sponsorship deals, while Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH), ended talks to extend a contract that had expired in December. Sponsor decisions on whether to stick with a spokesperson or team are driven by money, industry officials said. If they feel the sponsorship can still work, companies stand by their man, woman or sports group, like many have done with soccer's world governing body FIFA or the International Olympic Committee through their respective scandals.Industry executives agreed Sharapova was smart to get in front of the news, announcing the positive test herself and apologizing for her mistake. As a result, she will likely get a second chance with the public and sponsors alike, industry executives said. However, a lengthy suspension could in effect end her playing career and damage her status as one of the highest paid off-field female athletes. Forbes estimates her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.""In many ways, she's the ideal spokesperson for a brand. She's very attractive, highly successful and very competitive,"" said San Diego State University marketing professor George Belch, who has used a Harvard case study about her in his classes to tout her ability as a spokesperson. Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28 year old. Still ranked among the top players, she has won five Grand Slam titles in her career.While some critics argue a double standard exists for female athletes, several industry officials said Tiger Woods' sex scandal or the rape allegations against Kobe Bryant in the past would both play out differently in today's social media-driven culture. Issues companies may have waited out not long ago, now demand immediate attention, and some believe it being an Olympic year only raises the pressure to move fast. Consumer products companies like those associated with Sharapova have even more reason to move quickly to distance themselves from bad news, industry officials said. ""It takes a lot of time and money to build a lifestyle brand,"" said Gary Fechter, an attorney at McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals for almost four decades. And for sponsors that may have felt they were overpaying Sharapova, her positive drug test offers a ""back-door out,"" he said.A source close to the tennis star said her team was encouraged that Nike and Porsche simply suspended their deals rather than terminating them, suggesting the door may be open to reopening them in the future.In the short term, however, Sharapova's standing will surely take a hit.Her ""trust"" scores in an index created by the Marketing Arm for clients to measure celebrity influence will likely take a significant dip, managing director Matt Delzell said. Sharapova currently ranks in the top third, in the range of former New York Yankee all-star shortstop Derek Jeter, comedian Seth Myers and singer Demi Lovato, according to the unit of the Omnicom Group Inc (N:OMC), which books sports personalities for companies.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

207,"Mar 08, 2016 06:31PM ET",Sponsors back away from Sharapova after failed drug test,nan,"By Emma Thomasson and Ben KlaymanBERLIN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut ties with tennis star Maria Sharapova on Tuesday, the latest sponsor after  Nike  and Porsche to distance itself from the world's highest-paid female athlete following her failed drug test.The swift response on the heels of Sharapova's announcement on Monday signaled a change in attitude among high-profile corporate backers following a series of doping and corruption scandals in world sports.""We're now entering a zero tolerance era for sponsors,"" said Rupert Pratt, co-founder of sports sponsorship agency Generate. ""It is now seen as not acceptable to 'stand by your man' because of the amount of scrutiny corporates are now under.""Sharapova's failed drug test at January's Australian Open, one of four annual Grand Slam events, will likely lead to a ban for the 28-year-old Russian. The International Tennis Federation's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test. That ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as if the player shows no significant fault or negligence.Loss of sponsor income would be costly for Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner who earned $29.7 million last year, according to Forbes magazine, most of it from endorsements, appearances and royalties rather than victories on court. Sharapova, who lit up women's tennis when she won Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old, is still ranked among the top players. She was the world's highest-paid female athlete last year for the 11th consecutive year, and Forbes put her off-court career earnings at more than $200 million.Fellow athletes had mixed reactions to Sharapova's announcement that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium. The substance, recently banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), boosts blood flow and can enhance athletic performance. Sharapova, who lives in the United States, is at least the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium. It is widely available in Eastern Europe but not approved for use in the United States.""She's ready to take full responsibility and I think that showed a lot of courage and a lot of heart,"" Serena Williams, the top-ranked player in women's tennis, told reporters at a briefing ahead of a game in New York on Tuesday.Others were not so sympathetic.""I'm extremely angry and disappointed. I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what,"" tweeted former world No. 1 Jennifer Capriati, in a long series of posts attacking Sharapova. Aries Merritt, a U.S. hurdler, said there was no excuse for Sharapova to be unaware that WADA added meldonium to its latest list of banned drugs effective Jan. 1, which it circulated to competitors.""As an athlete it is your responsibility to always know what's being placed on the banned list. Period,"" said Merritt at the U.S. Olympic Committee summit in Los Angeles.Former U.S. Olympic swimmer Aaron Peirsol told Reuters there was some confusion over meldonium. ""It wasn't even anything that was illegal until the beginning of this year,"" he said. ""You have a bunch of people taking stuff that the athletes probably don't even know (is illegal)... it becomes gray.""Sharapova said she had not read an email informing her that meldonium was banned for use in sport.She will be provisionally suspended from playing tennis from March 12 and could be prevented from competing for Russia at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics this year.SOME SPONSORS ON THE FENCE Sharapova's deal with Tag Heuer, owned by French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH), expired at the end of 2015, and the company said on Tuesday it had dropped renewal talks in view of her announcement.Nike Inc (N:NKE), the world's biggest sportswear brand, and German luxury car maker Porsche, a unit of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), have said they are suspending their relationship with Sharapova as they gather more information and wait for a decision on a ban.A person close to Sharapova told Reuters her team was encouraged that none of the sponsors so far have said they were terminating contracts with the player, although they had the right to do so. ""Suspension means to put on hold,"" the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation. ""Under the circumstances we're very pleased that everybody is willing to stand by and see what facts come out instead of terminating."" Danone  SA (PA:DANO), the maker of Evian water, a longtime Sharapova sponsor, said on Tuesday it would monitor developments.  Avon Products  Inc (N:AVP), another sponsor, declined to comment on its endorsements.Brian Socolow, an expert in sports law and a partner at Loeb & Loeb LLP, said Nike's quick suspension was no surprise after its long support for now-disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong.But he said Sharapova may yet win back sponsors. ""She has the chance, like other athletes, to redeem herself and regain her leadership position as an endorser,"" said Socolow. ""She will have to demonstrate that it was an honest mistake and there are no other improper reasons she took the drug.""There was some scepticism about the sponsors' motives from tennis fans on social media.Ben Stanley (@BDStanley) tweeted on Tuesday, ""Nike is in the business of making money, not offering moral guidance. If it paid to keep Sharapova on, they'd do it.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

208,"Feb 25, 2016 08:34AM ET","Hugo Boss CEO steps down after weak China, U.S. sales",nan,"BERLIN (Reuters) -  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn)​ Chief Executive Claus-Dietrich Lahrs is stepping down after eight years at the helm of the German fashion house after the share price tumbled following a profit warning on weak sales in China and the United States.Hugo Boss shares fell to their lowest level in five years on Tuesday and Wednesday after the firm said it expects sales to grow more slowly than its long-term forecast in 2016 and adjusted operating profit to fall.The stock rose after Lahrs' departure was announced to trade up 2.5 percent at 1319 GMT (08:19 a.m. EST), ahead of a 1.9 percent firmer Stoxx 600 index (STOXX), but is still down 31 percent this year.Hugo Boss said it would start without delay to find a successor to Lahrs, who it said was leaving with effect of Feb. 29 ""upon his request as part of a mutual agreement"".Lahrs, a 52-year-old German who previously worked for Cartier, LVMH (PA:LVMH)and Christian Dior, joined Boss in 2008.Together with former private equity owner Permira, he drove the German company on a global expansion drive, increasing sales by almost two thirds as the brand opened about 100 new stores annually and expanded into women's wear. Hugo Boss's stock had more than doubled in value since Pemira's Red & Black investment vehicle took it over in 2007, but Permira sold off its remaining stake last year, leaving Italy's Marzotto family as the biggest shareholder.However, the company has stumbled as global sales of luxury goods have slowed, particularly in China.Boss said on Tuesday it would bring prices in Asia down closer to levels in Europe and the Americas and limit the distribution of its core brand in the U.S. wholesale business to try to avoid the impact of a market dominated by big discounts.Boss said Bernd Hake, currently responsible for the Europe, Middle East, Africa and India regions, will take responsibility for sales and retail as a new member of the managing board from March 1.Lahrs' other responsibilities will be taken on by other members of the board until a successor is found, Boss said.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

209,"Jan 23, 2016 04:00AM ET",Bulgari targets Chinese shoppers with mainland boutiques,nan,"By Martinne GellerDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Bulgari is investing more than ever in China, aiming to tap in to the growing reluctance of Chinese shoppers to buy abroad due to security fears, stricter customs checks and a devaluation of its currency.The world's third-largest watch and jewelry brand, part of luxury goods powerhouse LVMH (PA:LVMH), plans to open two boutiques in mainland China this year, Bulgari's CEO said, on top of three last year.""If you see there is a potential swing with more mainland and less travel proportion, it's one more reason to speed up your mainland investments,"" Bulgari Chief Executive Jean-Christophe Babin told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos.China's economy grew 6.9 percent last year, its slowest rate in 25 years, putting a damper on Chinese sales of everything from food to trips abroad. These foreign visits have often been a launch pad for purchases of luxury items, since they would avoid the hefty taxes levied in China.But Babin said some Chinese consumers have become nervous about traveling to Europe and other places, due to the November attacks in Paris, where 130 people were killed.""If we sell fewer watches to Chinese when they travel -- Paris obviously because people are a bit scared -- we see conversely a strong increase in our business in China mainland.""The shift to domestic purchases is also being fueled by the devaluation of the Chinese currency, which makes it more expensive to buy abroad, as well as stepped-up checks by Chinese customs on purchases made abroad. Chinese tourists returning from overseas trips are becoming subject to stricter-than-ever customs controls on what they bring back, Babin said, adding that watches are subject to a 30 percent levy plus a penalty that is a multiple of that for anyone caught not declaring the purchase.""People are quite scared to buy a $10,000 watch in Hong Kong, Zurich or Tokyo and eventually have to pay twice as much as they originally paid,"" Babin said. Bulgari, with annual sales estimated between 1.5 and 2 billion euros, is No. 3 behind Richemont's (VX:CFR) Cartier and Tiffany (N:TIF).""More than ever it makes a lot of sense for Bulgari to invest in China,"" said Babin. Chinese consumers, whether shopping at home or abroad, make up more than 30 percent of sales of Swiss watches, and are notorious lovers of luxury goods in general. Babin declined to give specific sales figures for its divisions, which also include leather goods and hotels.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

210,"Dec 31, 2015 08:57AM ET",Champagne sales set for record year ,nan,"By Pascale DenisPARIS (Reuters) - Champagne sales are set for a record year, driven by solid demand from export markets, favorable currencies and stabilizing sales in France, the fizzy drink's home market.Industry estimates gathered by Reuters showed that about 312 million bottles of the prestige sparkling wine will have been dispatched in 2015, a rise of between 2 and 3 percent from 2014.Revenue has risen 4.4 percent to 4.7 billion euros in 2015. In 2007, the record year so far, revenues reached 4.56 billion euros, before the global economic and financial crisis began weighing on the market a year later.The 2015 sales estimates reflected efforts to promote higher-priced products such as special blends and fine vintages, as well as growing demand for Rose Champagnes in Japan and the United States, Champagne's second export market after Britain.In Britain, a solid economy underpinned buoyant demand while austerity-hit Italy and Spain were starting to see signs of an upturn.Economic woes in Champagne's home market of France have taken the fizz out of global sales since 2010, but sales were stabilizing in volume and value this year and could even show a slight rise.""France is on a recovery path. Consumption stabilized,"" said Bruno Paillard, CEO of Lanson BCC (PA:LAN), the number two Champagne house behind luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH).Sales were improving in French hypermarkets as well as in specialized stores.""Consumers need to enjoy life,"" said Paillard, adding lower energy prices and interest rates may have helped improve consumer purchasing power.The Champagne market is dominated by LVMH, which owns the Dom Perignon, Moet & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Ruinart and Krug brands. Specialist makers include Lanson-BCC, Vranken (PA:VRKP) or Laurent Perrier (PA:LPER) as well as drinks group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) with its Mumm and Perrier-Jouet brands.Official figures for 2015 will be published next month.Champagne, which can be produced only in the region of the same name, is facing tougher competition from Spain's cava and Italy's prosecco, sold for as little as a third of the price. Industry professionals say the Champagne sector is fighting back by stepping up efforts to enhance the quality of its own product.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

211,"Nov 25, 2015 10:11AM ET",Big brands don't mind live Periscope stumbles to reach millennials,nan,"By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK (Reuters) - When Benefit Cosmetics, a San Francisco-based maker of skin care and makeup, used Twitter's Periscope live-streaming video service to make a product demonstration, a heckler became part of the live show, typing to the presenter, ""I can see down your top"" even though there was no wardrobe malfunction.During BMW of North America's (DE:BMWG) debut of its M2 coupe on Periscope last month, the sound dipped in and out as the driver talked about how the car handled. And one of  Royal Caribbean  International's (N:RCL) first video streams was disrupted by a viewer posting the alphabet one letter at a time, in an attempt to clog the comment feed. Still, the company was happy with the 30,000 viewers the campaign attracted, said Kara Wallace, the cruise operator's vice president, North American marketing.While glitches like those would be unthinkable in a produced, controlled advertising environment, big brands such as Royal Caribbean, BMW and Benefit are going ahead with plans to use live-streaming video to attract some of the most finicky consumers, young millennials who ignore many traditional and online ads. ""There is an authenticity to this kind of campaign,"" Wallace said. ""This is going to be the future of marketing."" Periscope, which  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) bought earlier this year, allows anyone to live-stream an event through a mobile phone, while viewers can participate by sending cartoon hearts across the video feed and typing comments that scroll across the screen for all to see. Some viewers love the chance to interact, with results that can surprise the advertisers. It is still early days for Periscope, which currently does not charge advertisers, and had 10 million accounts as of August, compared with more than 300 million at Twitter. Some brands are not sure about using Periscope to market to consumers. Snack and beverage company  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) has experimented with it a bit, but has not decided if it wants to make it a staple part of its marketing, said Cindy Chen, global head of e-commerce. ""Periscope isn't really set up right now to accommodate brands,"" said Dustin Callif, managing director, digital at Tool North America, which produced the Royal Caribbean streams. ""It's an experiment which is fun for a brand, but it is also risky."" WORKING ON THE FLY While brands are well-versed in handling outside comments that come with all social media, live streaming video is extra tricky as everything is real-time, executives said. Even Twitter was caught off guard on a Periscope stream of an earnings call when a watcher asked CEO Jack Dorsey if he was single, sending a flood of cartoon hearts across the screen. ""The biggest sort of potential headache of Periscope is that it is a live event and you can't script anything,"" said Pete Harmata, digital innovations manager at BMW of North America. ""You have to adjust on the fly, which can be pretty strenuous."" BMW pulled a 24-hour teaser of its M2 coupe, showing just the front of the car, after a few minutes, when impatient viewers demanded to see the vehicle immediately. Hours later, the automaker debuted the M2, streaming a test drive while taking questions and comments from viewers. The debut drew 5,000 viewers, a drop in the bucket compared with television, but it was a lot cheaper, and it reached its biggest fans, said Dan Kelleher, co-chief creative officer at kirshenbaum bond senecal + partners, or kbs, which created the campaign. Benefit, owned by luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH (PA:LVMH), has at least one person ready to block inappropriate comments during each stream, said Claudia Allwood, director of U.S. digital marketing. Benefit's Periscope streams have averaged 2,000 viewers per stream. Similarly, thousands viewed Royal Caribbean's Periscope streams, which showed scenes of everything from customers riding a zip line on the island of St. Kitts to chefs preparing meals on its ships. The Miami-based company streamed the clips live on Periscope and ran them on 80 digital billboards across New York City after a slight delay. To prepare for any potential problems, Royal Caribbean had ads ready to run on the billboards if the Periscope stream went down or something unsavory happened. While it did not need to run the replacement ads, some issues arose. A video from a natural water slide in Puerto Rico had so many viewers that after a few minutes commenting was shut down, said John Kearse, creative director at Boston-based Mullen Lowe Group, which worked on the campaign. With the delay between the live stream and digital billboards, the company had time to strip out the alphabet comments that delayed its stream. They prepared for worse. ""We had to know what the F-bomb was in Russian,"" Kearse said.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

212,"Nov 23, 2015 06:22AM ET",Cognac makers ramp up U.S. efforts as China sips less ,nan,"By Martinne GellerCOGNAC, France (Reuters) - France's centuries-old cognac houses are raising their bets on the U.S. market with new products and campaigns to broaden the drink's appeal beyond its African American stronghold.The big four producers -- LVMH Moet Hennessy (PA:LVMH),  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and Beam Suntory (BSI.UL) -- have turned more of their attention to the U.S. following a drop in sales in China after an anti-graft campaign.On its home turf cognac is seen as the drink of choice for mature gentlemen but in the United States it is often enjoyed by status-conscious revelers inspired by blingy bottles and hip-hop name-dropping songs like Busta Rhymes' ""Pass the Courvoisier.""Black culture's taste for cognac, which only comes from the area around the western French town of that name, dates back at least to the time when U.S. soldiers were visiting jazz-mad Paris bars during the world wars. Back home it was an alternative to American whiskey, often made in southern states with histories of slavery and racial segregation.The African American community accounted for nearly two-thirds of all cognac drunk in the world's biggest market, say executives and analysts. Yet that's now changing. Producers of the drink, made by distilling white wine and aging it in oak barrels for anywhere from two to dozens of years, now need to reach other groups to help fill the space left by China.""We don't want cognac just to be for one category of person,"" Remy Martin Executive Director Augustin Depardon told Reuters during a visit to the Cognac region, where over 75,000 hectares of vineyards grow mostly Ugni Blanc grapes that become the building blocks of cognac.Depardon said a new campaign featuring Hollywood actor Jeremy Renner, one of the stars of The Avengers, was aimed at a broader audience.'PRIORITY NO. 1'Hennessy, Remy Martin, Martell and Courvoisier make 85 percent of all cognac, and they are competing harder than ever, trying to harness the current boom in ""brown spirits"" like bourbon and rum.""We've seen a lot of our cognac competitors be more aggressive in the United States, actually investing in media campaigns on a scale we've never seen before,"" said Jean-Baptiste Rivail, Hennessy's director of business development for the Americas. ""The momentum of Hennessy and brown spirits has attracted quiet players to play harder in the U.S. market.""One of the quiet players is Pernod Ricard's Martell, which at 300 years old, is cognac's elder statesman. After pushing hard in China to become the leading player there, the brand is now trying to lift its 2 percent share of the U.S. market.""It is going to be our priority Number One,"" said Christophe Pienkowski, Martell's international heritage brand ambassador.Initiatives include a new variety called Charactere, which Martell hopes will help convert whisky-drinking Latinos, and a campaign with The Roots, who have recently gone from respected hip-hop group to household name as the official band for the U.S.'s Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.Cognac suppliers sold 4.1 million 9-litre cases in the U.S. last year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, up 11.9 percent from 2013, which only saw a 3.7 percent gain. It was the fastest-growing segment of a spirits market up only 2.2 percent, though from a small base. The trade group's economist said this year may be even stronger. Euromonitor forecasts U.S. retail cognac sales of $5.2 billion in 2015, up 9 percent from last year. That would see it surpass the Chinese market, which it estimates will have lost 36 percent of its value since a peak of $7.8 billion in 2012.COCKTAIL CRAZEThe companies are also trying to push cognac into cocktails. While brandy is the main ingredient for classic drinks like Sidecars and Alexanders, it is not as prevalent on modern cocktail menus as bourbon, tequila and gin. To that end, Hennessy has launched Hennessy Black, which it says is better for cocktails as it has a delicate taste that eases mixability and a stronger alcohol content that can withstand dilution.""Cognac seems, in my mind, to have a rightful place in the cocktail craze that hasn't been fully taken advantage of,"" said Rabobank analyst Stephen Rannekleiv. ""There's an opportunity to continue making inroads in a demographic they have not generally had a strong presence in."" Nielsen data for the most recent 30-day period suggests that white adult consumers drank 27 percent of the nation's cognac even though they represent 66 percent of the adult population. Black consumers drank 40 percent, though they were only 11.2 percent of the population. Despite efforts to broaden their market, the brands will be treading carefully so as not to alienate their core audience, having seen how quickly Cristal champagne fell from grace in 2006 after a boycott by hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, who is now a backer of Bacardi's new cognac D'Usse.""African Americans are still accounting for a huge part of cognac consumption in the U.S. and this is still our main target with D'Usse,"" said Philippe Jouhaud, sales and marketing director for D'Usse.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

Several managers from LVMH have been making trips to Iran in Sept. and Oct. and executives from Dior, Louis Vuitton and Bulgari are preparing to go there next month to examine investment opportunities, the sources said.And the French trade group Comité Colbert, which represents 80 luxury brands, said it was planning to organize a trip in the spring. Iran, once dominated by bazaars and tiny shops, has seen an explosion in shopping malls in recent years.""Many people do not know that Iranians' relationship to luxury and refinement is really quite close to that of the French or the Italians,"" said Sara Yalda, a Franco-Iranian writer who is organizing a series of 14 conferences on Iran at a big theater in Paris next year. ""I think luxury brands are going to be very successful there.""Many luxury brands such as jewelers Cartier, part of  Richemont  (VX:CFR), and Bulgari are sold in Iran through multi-brand shops. Iran, whose economy is largely dependent on oil and gas revenues, has more than 3 million high net worth individuals who are major and regular buyers of luxury goods, analysts estimate. But several luxury groups including Chanel, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH's Dior and Louis Vuitton said they were adopting a ""wait and see"" attitude for now until the evolution of Iran's international relations became clearer. ""We have to see how things evolve from a political standpoint and see if there is a suitable retail infrastructure,"" Dior Chief Executive Sidney Toledano said. ""This is not short term but things can evolve quite quickly.""Key political milestones will be Iran's legislative elections in February and the outcome of the U.S. presidential campaign in November as there is concern president Barack Obama's successor could re-impose sanctions.Also, as part of the July Vienna agreement, there is a ""snap back"" provision which would re-instate the sanctions if Iran failed to fulfill its commitments.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

219,"Oct 16, 2015 09:39AM ET",Rare store sales data highlights Wal-Mart's China challenge,nan,"By Adam JourdanSHANGHAI (Reuters) - A rare glimpse at figures for a number of Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (N:WMT) China outlets shows sales slid 6 percent last year, casting a shadow over the firm's target for China to account for a quarter of its global retail growth over the next five years.The U.S. retail giant doesn't break out its China store sales, but a local joint venture partner submitted filings with the data to a Chinese asset exchange platform as part of a planned sale of minority stakes in 21 Walmart stores. Wal-Mart had 415 China stores at the end of August.Combined revenue at those 21 stores fell 6 percent to 26.6 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), the data show, illustrating Wal-Mart's challenge to drive sales growth in the world's second-largest economy, where retailers are under pressure from a cooling economy and the rise of shopping online.International firms from luxury brands such as LVMH (PA:LVMH) and  Burberry  (L:BRBY) to global auto makers, are feeling the pinch as China's consumers tighten their belts.The data, released in filings from a unit of state-backed conglomerate China Resources Corp (CRC), show no obvious single factor impacting performance at the stores, which vary in size and age. The 21 stores, located across China from Beijing to far-western Sichuan, employ some 30,000 staff, including more than 20,000 at a single outlet in the southern city of Shenzhen. Wal-Mart says it has more than 100,000 employees in China.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon this week acknowledged China was a ""bit tough"", but the world's largest retailer by revenue maintains that in the long-term China is an ""exciting, dynamic, large and competitive market"". ""As the middle class continues to grow we see an incredible opportunity and we have been putting the pieces in place,"" McMillon said on an investor call on Wednesday. Wal-Mart plans to grow its China footprint by nearly a third with around 115 new stores to open by 2017.In August, Wal-Mart said comparative sales in China dipped 1.4 pct in May-July.TEMPERATURE CHECKTo be sure, the Chinese filings provide only a temperature check on part of Wal-Mart's China business, but analysts said the stores' combined sales slide was still a worrying sign. The filings, posted on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, show 18 of the 21 stores saw sales decline last year.""If on average across these 21 stores there's a 6 percent drop, that's more than you'd expect,"" said Torsten Stocker, Hong Kong-based retail analyst with AT Kearney. ""They've previously never really released China-specific data so it may well be concerning them. If I was in their shoes I'd be a bit worried.""He noted the data covers only a small selection of Wal-Mart's China stores, adding: ""It fits the story that the last couple of years have been pretty tough. It's still a very difficult environment for foreign retailers.""A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to comment beyond an earlier statement saying the firm respected the ""investment decision"" of its joint venture partner. China Resources, which is seeking more than $500 million for the stake in the stores, did not respond to queries about why it was looking to sell, though it does have other retail interests including a venture with Britain's  Tesco  PLC (L:TSCO).Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart slashed its global outlook on Wednesday for the next fiscal year, sparking the steepest one-day drop in the company's shares in a quarter of a century.TOUGH ROAD AHEADThe China filings show debt levels at the 21 stores have also risen, with total liabilities equal to around 80 percent of total assets as of end-May, up from 76 percent in 2013. Profits and margins, however, improved over that period, signaling a successful drive to rein in costs.China's food retail market has been cooling, while local rivals have eaten away at international firms' market share, according to market research firm CTR China. The market grew at 3.4 percent in the second quarter, down from closer to 10 percent in early 2013.This has seen Wal-Mart, France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Tesco all see sales growth slip, with average same-store sales growth dropping into negative territory last year, according to consultancy OC&C.""The ability of Western retailers to really compete in China isn't going to get any easier. Some advantages they had for a number of years - branding, supply chain, back office - the local guys are catching up on that,"" said AT Kearney's Stocker.Wal-Mart has been beefing up its online presence in China to counter slowing growth offline, buying out e-commerce firm Yihaodian.com in July.($1 = 6.3545 Chinese yuan renminbi)  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

230,"Jul 01, 2015 10:14AM ET",LVMH's Donna Karan quits as designer of own name brand,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Donna Karan has resigned as chief designer of the fashion brand she founded and sold to French luxury goods owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) as the group opts to concentrate on its more accessible DKNY line.Parent company Donna Karan International (DKI) said it planned to suspend fashion shows and designer collections ""for a period of time"" but would continue to support its significant license business for products such as watches and eyewear.""DKI will also reorganize its teams and restructure in order to substantially increase its focus on the DKNY brand,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday.New-York born Karan, 66, said that after ""much soul-searching"" she had decided to spend more time on her separate Urban Zen brand. Fashion experts had long been saying that her mainline Donna Karan New York label lost appeal among consumers after becoming too zany with designs featuring tribal prints.The move is part of a wider clean-up at LVMH's fashion and leather brands under the stewardship of division chief Pierre-Yves Roussel. In April, the company hired Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne, founders of the New York-based and award-winning brand Public School, as designers for DKNY, a more street-smart and less expensive label than the high-end Donna Karan brand. Analysts estimate DKI made just over 400 million euros ($444 million) in 2014 with more than 90 percent of revenue coming from the DKNY brand.The two brands together have over 275 retail stores and more than 80 in-store outlets across 41 countries.When Donna Karan sold her brand to LVMH in 2001, the group was looking to gain a stronger presence in the US market. At the time, she had obtained from LVMH the right to exploit the Urban Zen brand she had also created, a move that surprised many industry observers since it was a rival brand to her own. DKI said Donna Karan would remain an adviser to the company. Earlier this year, LVMH decided to restructure the underperforming Marc by Marc Jacobs line and fold it into the main Marc Jacobs collection which is also being streamlined.Marc Jacobs also been closing shops including a flagship one on the plush Place du Palais Royal in Paris. In 2013, Marc Jacobs left the creative helm of Louis Vuitton, LVMH's biggest luxury brand, to focus on his eponymous brand and its planned initial public offering expected to take place in the next few years.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

234,"Jun 11, 2015 10:01AM ET","Fashion brand Bally back on growth path, says CEO",nan,"By Astrid WendlandtMONACO (Reuters) - Bally, the long-struggling Swiss leather goods maker, is back in growth mode after years of stagnant sales, buoyed by more contemporary designs and solid demand from Japanese and U.S. buyers, its chief executive said.Frederic de Narp said he aimed to lift Bally's annual sales to 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) within 5-10 years from its current level of 400 million euros. The 164-year-old company, one of Europe's biggest shoe makers before World War I, has lacked a clear strategic direction for many years, industry players say.Between 2008 and 2010 its then-designer Brian Atwood put out perilously high stilettos, which they say took the brand too far away from its Swiss conservative, classical roots. Then, Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler, who left two years ago, put out retro 1930s style collections that jarred somewhat with the brand's minimalist, sober image. Narp, in the job for a year-and-a-half, said Pablo Coppola, the designer he chose, was now creating designs that were elegant and in tune with current fashion trends. Coppola previously worked for Dior, Tom Ford and Celine. ""Bally has a fantastic heritage, the only thing we have to do is to exploit it well,"" said the CEO, who previously worked at jewelers Cartier and Harry Winston.""We do not sell a sex story, we sell effortless chic,"" he told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the FT Business of Luxury Summit in Monaco. The privately-held company mainly sells shoes and bags, with one of its best-selling products the Sommet bag, a flare-edged leather bag that starts at around 1,200 euros. Narp said Bally's sales, which have stagnated for more than four years, were up 3 percent at constant exchange rates since January, in line with rivals such as Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER). The company expects full-year growth to be in the low-to-mid single digits.Bally is profitable at the underlying level, or in terms of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Narp added.JAPANESE GROWTHJapan has been one of its strongest-growing markets this year - with sales up 49 percent at constant exchange rates - and business has been picking up also in the United States where sales rose 7 percent also at constant exchange rates.The company opened its first flagship in 20 years in October, on London's New Bond Street, and plans to open nine more over the next five years, with the next one on Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles in November and another in Ginza, Tokyo, in 2016.Narp said he wanted to double Bally's business in the United States and Japan over the next five years.He said it would take time to turn around Bally, particularly in the current tough environment, with subdued demand in Europe and slower economic growth in China.Bally has 60 stores in Greater China and makes more than half of its sales to Chinese customers, Narp said.Now one of his top objectives was to make Bally more appealing to women as they now only made up 30 percent of clientele and he wanted to boost that figure to 50 percent within the next few years. To raise its profile, Bally also hired super-model Freja Beha Erichsen, who has worked for Chanel and Louis Vuitton, for its advertising campaigns. Narp said sales from women's products such as handbags, shoes and other small leather goods were up 15 percent at constant exchange rates since the beginning of the year. He said Bally's top creative and marketing leadership was now based in London because it was easier to attract talent there than in Switzerland. Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings bought Bally from private equity firm TPG in 2008, a deal that marked its first venture into the fashion and luxury world.JAB, an investment company with over $39 billion of assets under management, works for the Reimanns - German billionaires who inherited their fortune from soap and detergent maker Reckitt Benckiser.It controls fashion brand Belstaff, New-York listed cosmetics group Coty (N:COTY), London-quoted shoe maker Jimmy Choo (L:CHOO) as well as coffee maker Jacobs Douwe Egberts.   /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

239,"May 29, 2015 07:03AM ET",High spirits battle: Asia tycoons vie for cognac maker Louis Royer,nan,"By Denny Thomas and Khettiya JittapongHONG KONG/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi is considering buying cognac maker Louis Royer, people familiar with the matter said, potentially locking horns with a Philippine tycoon for the French firm amid a forecast rebound in Asian demand for luxury spirits.Liquor firm  Emperador Inc  (PS:EMP), controlled by the Philippines' fourth-richest person, Andrew Tan, said last week it has submitted a bid to buy Louis Royer, which has been put on the block by Japan's Suntory Holdings Ltd [SUNTH.UL] and is valued at about $150 million by sources. Charoen controls Thai Beverage PCL (SI:TBEV).The emerging battle for Louis Royer underscores the tycoons' desire to add top-end spirit brands to their portfolios, both to help sell their other brands and to benefit from a revival in demand for cognac in Asia, which is driven by countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam where wealth is accumulating rapidly.""It's not really about the fundamental value of the business,"" said one senior Hong Kong-based M&A banker involved in the deal. ""It's about having a high profile brand inside your portfolio that helps you sell other products.""It was not immediately clear if there were other bidders for Louis Royer or when a final decision on the sale will be reached. Suntory declined to comment.""We don't have a (cognac) business. We are open for every opportunity for beverage business,"" said Vichate Tantiwanich, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Thai Bev, when asked if his group will make a bid for Louis Royer. ""But for this brand (Louis Royer), we can't confirm that we will buy.""Louis Royer, which has about 7 billion yen ($57.1 million) of annual sales, was bought by Suntory in 1989 as the Japanese company was expanding overseas. But over the years, Suntory has taken on too much debt to build its global empire, including the $15.7 billion purchase of spirits maker Beam Inc, and is looking to exit some of its brands.CHINA CRACKDOWNAsian demand for cognac, a variety of distilled brandy named after the town of Cognac in France, has dropped over the past few years due to a crackdown on conspicuous consumption in China. But it is set to recover and reach 30.4 million litres in 2019, a rise of 13 percent from 2015 that will outpace world demand growth, market research firm Euromonitor forecasts.Malaysia and Vietnam are the other big cognac consumers in the region, ranking number three and four, behind China and Taiwan. Vietnam's demand is set to surge 75 percent between 2014-2019, Euromonitor estimates.Louis Royer, with its XO cognac that was launched in 1988 in a decanter, is the smallest of the global cognac makers. The industry is dominated by the likes of LVMH (PA:LVMH) and its Hennessy brand, and  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP), maker of Remy Martin cognac, among others.Charoen was Thailand's third-wealthiest in 2014, when he had a net worth of $11.3 billion, according to Forbes. Tan has a net worth of about $4.6 billion, the publication estimates."

242,"Apr 20, 2015 10:32AM ET",Chinese tourists' luxury spending soars - Global Blue,nan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Chinese tourists spent a record amount on luxury goods last month, helped by shopping sprees in Europe as the weak euro made items cheaper than at home, VAT refund company Global Blue said.Spending by Chinese tourists, the biggest buyers of luxury goods, soared by 122 percent in March after a 52 percent rise in February, bringing the increase for the first quarter to 67 percent, Global Blue said in a report published on Monday. This compared with a rise of 32 percent in the fourth quarter and 18 percent in 2014.Many Chinese tourists have stayed away from luxury hot spot Hong Kong - where big brands have invested significantly in new shops in recent years - following pro-democracy protests last year.""This continues to reflect the redirection of Chinese spending from Hong Kong towards Europe in particular, given the widening of the price differentials, which is a much-discussed theme during the ongoing reporting season,"" broker  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) said in a note about the Global Blue figures.Exchange rate movements have led to significant regional price differences, with the same luxury item sometimes costing more than 50 percent less in European capitals than in major Chinese cities.The trend has encouraged Asian buyers to snap up goods in Europe and resell them at home, a practice often referred to as parallel trading or the gray market and which brands worry could raise issues about their products' perceived authenticity.Broker JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove estimates 20 to 40 percent of luxury sales in mainland China are now parallel, based on what luxury goods executives and consultants have said.Last week,  Burberry  (L:BRBY) said it would re-align prices to match rivals after brands such as Chanel and Patek Philippe cut prices in Asia by over 20 percent to reduce the discrepancy with Europe. Kering  (PA:PRTP) will be expected to give an update on its pricing policy, particularly for its flagship Gucci brand, when it posts first-quarter results on Tuesday.Global Blue said overall, worldwide global tourism spending reached its highest level in March since May 2011 despite Russian spending falling 39 percent, against a 51 percent drop in January.Watches and jewelry performed best, with sales up 67 percent in March against 32 percent the previous month, it said. Leather goods sales rose 50 percent, versus 24 percent in February.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

245,"Mar 31, 2015 06:30AM ET",Yoox buys Richemont's Net-a-Porter in all-share deal,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Valentina ZaPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Italian online fashion retailer Yoox has bought Net-a-Porter, its upmarket rival, in an all-share deal that creates an industry leader in the booming online luxury market, with combined sales of 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion).Net-a-Porter (NAP) owner  Richemont  (VX:CFR) will receive 50 percent of the combined Yoox Net-a-Porter Group but its voting rights will be capped at 25 percent, putting Yoox (MI:YOOX) effectively in charge of the combined business. ""Today, we open the doors to the world's biggest luxury fashion store. It is a store that never closes, a store without geographical borders,"" said NAP founder Natalie Massenet, who will oversee editorial content and advertising of the new group as executive chairman.Yoox boss, founder and minority shareholder Federico Marchetti will become chief executive and shape strategy.""Between us, we have changed the fashion industry somehow and we will continue to change it,"" Marchetti told journalists in a conference call on Tuesday.STILL SMALL The online luxury goods industry is still in its infancy, making up only around 5 percent of total luxury sales because many brands put off Internet expansion, worrying it would not offer customers the same high-end experience as their stores. But many executives now believe the Internet will be key to driving future sales, particularly among the so-called Millennials, web-savvy customers born between 1980 and 2000.Online luxury is not yet very profitable: Both Yoox's and NAP's operating margin is less than 5 percent compared with more than 25 percent for most big luxury brands such as Gucci or Prada. But the pair hope their bigger size will help cut warehouse, logistical, back-office and distribution costs, lifting margins. Yoox operates the online sales of fashion brands such as Ermenegildo Zegna and  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent and also sells items at a discount. Analysts said the deal could help boost Yoox's chances of retaining luxury brands that might otherwise have wanted to take their online operations in-house once they gained experience. ""I'm positive on the outlook for the online luxury market. I believe it's a structural change that will gain traction as younger generations of more 'digitally minded' managers get to the top,"" said Gian Luca Pacini at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MILAN:ISP) in Milan. NAP, which is regarded as having helped make online shopping an entertainment experience, specializes in current season and off-the-runway items and advises customers on what to wear them with. It also published the fashion magazine Porter. Marchetti said NAP would have the same valuation as Yoox once the deal was completed in September. Analysts valued NAP at around 1.5 billion euros, above Yoox which stood at 1.32 billion euros on Friday before news of the potential deal came out. Yoox shares, which gained already nearly 10 percent on Monday after Yoox and Richemont confirmed Reuters reports they were in talks, were up more than 8 percent by 0501 EDT at 25.14 euros, valuing Yoox at 1.56 billion euros. The combined business will generate adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 108 million euros in 2014 and annual synergies of around 60 million euros by the third full year, the two companies said. If Yoox shareholders approve the deal in June, the new group will launch a rights issue of around 200 million euros ($216 million) in the fall to fund growth, with Richemont expected to fund around half the sum, a spokesman for the Swiss group said.Marchetti said strategic investors keen to participate in the capital increase could include luxury brands but gave no further details.Richemont has agreed to a lock-up period of three years regarding half of its stake, or 25 percent, which analysts said they would expect the Swiss group to eventually sell.

247,"Mar 20, 2015 06:16PM ET",Luxury brands hedge their bets with smartwatches,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - The flurry of technology deals luxury watchmakers announced this week to tackle the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch threat are more a way to hedge their bets in case the smartwatch market takes off than a strategic U-turn.The costs of development of these hybrid watches, combining elements of traditional watchmaking with digital know-how and wireless connectivity, will be mostly financed by the technology providers, industry specialists predicted.Therefore, the partnerships unveiled at the Baselworld fair actually involve little investment for luxury brands - aside from their marketing efforts - but represent potentially high returns in terms of image and sales.On Thursday, LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Tag Heuer and Bulgari, and  Kering 's (PA:PRTP) Gucci were among the more than dozen or so watch brands that announced partnerships with technology companies.Regarding Tag Heuer's alliance with U.S. chip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unveiled on Thursday, independent financial analyst Richard Windsor said: ""I strongly suspect that Intel and Google will be putting up the majority of the development costs of the product, which is expected to be launched before the end of the year.""Few details of the watch were provided such as its functions or price, and Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver acknowledged it was not yet clear whether gaining the ""Intel Inside"" also meant losing the precious ""Swiss Made"" label.""Swiss brands like TAG are hedging their bets – just in case 'wrist computers' become popular and they are totally out of the game,"" said Exane  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca. But while the announcement helped Tag Heuer make headlines and project the image of a brand in tune with its times, the project has many limitations, and could, in fact, fail to ever yield a product, Windsor said.OPPOSITE WORLDSMany luxury watchmakers, including Patek Philippe and Breguet, said this week smartwatches were incompatible with their brands' values and the timelessness of their products. The industry is divided on whether there will be strong demand for smartwatches whether they are made by Apple, Samsung (LONDON:0593xq), Pebble or luxury brands. The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model, making the company's first foray in the personal luxury goods market.But Apple has been taking more leaves out of luxury books than luxury brands have been using consumer electronics recipes. The Californian computer company provided the first glimpse of its watch during Paris fashion week and photos were taken of designer Karl Lagerfeld and U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour admiring it in the trendy Parisian shop Colette. Apple has joined forces with model Christy Turlington, poached top executives from luxury brands such as Burberry, Yves Saint Laurent and Tag Heuer and used architects from Foster & Partners who worked for luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, to design some of its boutiques. Yet, for many people, the Apple watch is the antithesis of a luxury product. A Cartier and a Rolex watch usually retains value or gains value in the second-hand market while Apple devices very quickly depreciate.Bernstein luxury analyst Mario Ortelli said the tech industry ""seems to be endeavoring to shape the world into an egalitarian utopia, with themes such as shared economy (AirBNB, Uber), and democratization of information until it is universally accessible (Google)"".Luxury goods companies, however, ""are inherently exclusive and most of the desirability and value of their products is derived from the fact that not everyone can have it…or even afford it"".Windsor also noted it was not the first time Tag Heuer experimented with electronics as it introduced a mobile phone called Meridiist in 2008 which ""eventually sank without a trace"".  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

It is the company's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors. The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets.""We believe wearable technology will take off,"" Michael Bell, vice president of Intel's New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair.Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by  Luxottica  (MI:LUX), watchmaker Fossil (O:FOSL), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony.""Tag Heuer's decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said.""With Apple Watch hitting the market it's no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow.""Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music. The unit of French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) gave no details of pricing or launch timing.Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however.Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group (VX:UHR) watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (PA:HRMS) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch.""The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,"" he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

249,"Mar 03, 2015 08:55AM ET",New Tag Heuer boss replaces top managers in turnaround drive,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - The new head of Tag Heuer, luxury group LVMH's (PA:LVMH) biggest watch brand, has replaced half a dozen top managers as part of a drive to revive sales, he told Reuters. Jean-Claude Biver, who took the helm in December, said the brand needed to focus on best-sellers such as the all-steel mechanic Carrera and Aquaracer models costing around $1,500-$4,000, over more expensive watches that did not sell so well. A drive to sell models over $5,000-$6,000 has backfired for Tag Heuer which, along with a general industry slowdown, led it to cut management and production jobs and make some staff temporarily unemployed in September.Biver said he had chosen to promote internal and younger staff whom he was coaching, as bringing in outsiders could be disruptive at a time when the brand was undergoing change.He said the new appointments concerned key posts such as heads of marketing, sales, production and customer service, with the new team in place since the end of last year.""When you are trying to make changes in the corporate culture, it is not the right time to bring in external people who do not know the history of the company,"" Biver said in an interview.Tag Heuer, which is estimated to make close to 900 million euros ($1 billion) in annual sales, competes with Swatch's (VX:UHR) Longines and Omega as well as privately-owned Breitling. It makes around one third of its sales in the United States, its biggest single market.Tag Heuer's experience resembles that of other luxury brands such as Gucci, whose upmarket strategy has also dented sales. Last month, Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) admitted it had not focused enough on ""entry-level"" leather goods, which make up the bulk of business. Biver, 65, a watch industry veteran, became head of LVMH watches just under a year ago after successfully developing watch brand Hublot. He took on the revamp of sister brand Tag Heuer at the end of last year, a mission he described as ""probably the last and one of the most challenging and interesting of my life"".To boost morale, he is aiming to meet all 800 staff by June at a series of two-hour breakfasts, each involving 40 people.""I want to bring pragmatism, humility, and help people understand that the customer is the priority,"" he said.Biver said Tag Heuer had also offered to pay for employees' train tickets and meals to attend the Geneva car show, which starts this week and where the brand has a stand, and later this month to attend Baselworld, the world's biggest watch fair.  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

250,"Feb 13, 2015 09:13AM ET",Can Ferrari really cut it in luxury beyond supercars?,nan,"By Agnieszka Flak MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari faces a battle to persuade investors that it should be priced as a high-flying luxury goods stock, given a carmaker's margins and the heavy investment required to make its prancing horse logo a big attraction on other exclusive lines. Few would question the business acumen of Sergio Marchionne, redoubtable chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), but his strategy for squeezing every last drop of value from the listing of the group's illustrious Italian sports car brand has certainly raised a few eyebrows.""Ferrari is capable of being a fully-fledged luxury brand,"" Marchionne declared last month, setting his stall out to target the kind of high-end valuation multiples enjoyed by the likes of LVMH (PA:LVMH) and Richemont (VX:CFR). The 62-year-old said Ferrari is worth up to 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion), eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) slated for the first half of this year and hoping for a chunky windfall to boost FCA's own ambitious five-year investment plan.But for all Ferrari's Formula One racing pedigree, exclusivity exemplified by the LaFerrari supercar's 1 million euro price tag and a production cap that maintains a healthy customer waiting list, the company has its work cut out if it is to join a sector that trades at about 20 times future earnings. That's more than double the average for carmakers. It has to be acknowledged that Ferrari is no laggard in the money-making stakes, with profit nearly tripling over the past decade and its margins of 14 percent unmatched by any carmaker bar Porsche (DE:VOWG_p). But those margins are well below Prada's (HK:1913) 26 percent and have been under pressure from rising costs.Revenue growth has been more gentle than that of most European luxury stocks and its capital expenditure and research and development requirements are more than double, depressing its return on capital. SHORT ON DETAILWhile the multiples investors will pay depend on Ferrari's ability to grow, it is hard to see what the company has beyond its cars that would fit the luxury mold.Ferrari has the capacity to raise annual production to 10,000 vehicles a year from 7,000, but Marchionne has made clear that output will be kept below demand to protect the brand's exclusivity and told analysts in a post-results conference call last month that further detail on his strategy would not be forthcoming until nearer the IPO.Ferrari's merchandising division might seem an obvious starting point, but Marchionne has denied this. In any case, the elevated prices of T-shirts, bags and shoes bearing the prancing horse are well below those commanded by luxury goods.Its theme park in Abu Dhabi is also accessible to anyone willing to fork out 250 dirham ($70) for a one-day pass. ""If you're already available to everyone, then making your way back up to the luxury level is nearly impossible,"" said Manfred Abraham at brand-building consultancy BrandCap. ""They would have to stop doing a lot of things and start again, which is a massive investment ... how attractive is that to shareholders?""Investors have also been left scratching their heads over Marchionne's statement that carmaking, which accounts for the bulk of sales and profit, is ""incidental"" to Ferrari.As shown by Porsche Design, tire maker Pirelli's (MI:PECI) PZero and Bugatti's move into apparel, previous attempts by automotive groups to stretch beyond their core products have not provided a major revenue boost. Then there's the Ferrari logo and colors, which analysts have said make it a difficult sell in the fashion and design world. LUXURY ALLIANCE?There was talk of a luxury alliance with other opulent Italian brands to rival conglomerates such as Kering (PA:PRTP), but the concept has been dismissed by two bankers close to the company.Analysts, meanwhile, have pointed to the potential for exclusive clubs and hotels for the super-rich or Ferrari moving into high-value motorcycles and boats. However, Bernstein analyst Max Warburton remains skeptical, suggesting that the Ferrari brand could be extended at a luxury premium only to watches, perfumes and eyewear. ""A sports car maker has little competitive advantage when it comes to producing and selling personal luxury goods,"" he said.Regardless of its prospects as a true luxury goods business, the spinning off of Ferrari is far from a car crash. The divorce will unlock the value of a business that made 12 percent of FCA's profit last year. It could also pave the way for FCA to attempt a tie-up with another carmaker, perhaps focusing on the Asian market, bankers have said.Yet how investors interpret Marchionne's bold statements remains unclear, with analysts' estimates for Ferrari's worth ranging anywhere between 5 billion euros and 10 billion euros. ""With luxury it's a lot about emotion and allure,"" one U.S. investment banker said. ""People may not fully buy into Marchionne's argument, but they will put money on Ferrari on the promise of what it represents and could be.""  /6938/FP_EN_site/FP_EN_TextNote

251,"Feb 11, 2015 09:10AM ET",Prada needs to focus less on new shops and more on new handbags,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt and Valentina ZaPARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - If in fashion, being late on a trend can be lethal, playing catch-up in terms of business strategy can be just as damaging.Prada is learning that lesson the hard way. The trend in luxury goods is to drum up same store sales by curbing expansion and wowing customers with new products, yet Prada continues to pay over the odds to open swanky new shops and stock them with handbags little changed from previous bestsellers.Prada, say analysts, now urgently needs to focus less on new stores and more on new handbags.The group, which also owns the Miu Miu and Church's brands, opened 250 stores in the past three years, far more than rivals. It has finally slowed the pace but still plans 30-35 more stores this year, which it says is part of its long-term strategy.""Prada is starting to focus on same-store sales growth three years later than some of their peers as their priorities were elsewhere, but it is clearly better to do it later rather than never,"" Erwan Rambourg, luxury goods analyst at HSBC and author of The Bling Dynasty, a book focusing on Chinese shoppers.Analysts estimate same-store sales, which Prada stopped reporting last year, fell year-on-year by 12 percent in the third quarter to Oct. 31 and may have dropped by as much as 9 percent in the quarter to Jan. 31.Prada's costly retail space, combined with slower growth, has hammered margins and valuation. The group's share price nearly halved in the past two years and most analysts still have sell or hold recommendations on the stock.Its operating margin fell to 15.4 percent in the third quarter from 21.3 percent in the first half. Some analysts expect small margin growth this year, mainly thanks to the strong dollar that will boost reported earnings in euros.Prada is not alone facing difficulty at a tricky time for luxury goods makers, challenged by cheaper ""accessible luxury"" brands like Michael Kors (N:KORS) and Longchamp.Other brands seen as having rested on their laurels in terms of strikingly new products, like Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci and Tod's (MI:TOD), have also struggled to produce growth.But the strategy of concentrating on same store sales has nevertheless produced success for some luxury brands. Arch-rival Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) revealed last week that it had enjoyed a strong rebound by investing heavily in exciting new products under new designer Nicolas Ghesquiere. It also halted the opening of new stores.PLAYING CATCH-UPWhen it floated in 2011, Prada's ambition was to catch up with bigger rivals by expanding. It spared no expense, splurging on ""key money"" - cash up front to secure the best locations.In Milan, Prada outbid Apple and Gucci to build a menswear shop opposite its historic boutique in the prestigious late 19th Century Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade, paying more than 20 million euros to get the spot, real estate sources said. Prada declined to comment.In the plush ski resort of Courchevel, it financed the renovation of the entire Place du Rocher to make it a more fitting address for its new boutique.Meanwhile, some customers say the new shops carry handbags that have not evolved much in recent years, as if the company were afraid to change a product that worked well for so long.""Just arrived"" Prada handbags these days include two-toned satchels and new versions of the Twin Bag launched last year, fitted with a top flap and double zips. The product is similar in shape and carries many of the same features as previous best-sellers, such as the Double Bag or Galleria.Some bags start at 1,450 euros. In crocodile, they can reach 18,500 euros.""Unless you have strong feelings about sewn-on handles versus buckles, there's not much in the way of meaningful variety or novelty,"" wrote Amanda Mull on the widely-followed PurseBlog.Customers have become savvier and more demanding. Partly thanks to the Internet, they know more about a brand's new products than in the past, and will readily abandon brands that seem to trail in innovation.""They've lost their touch,"" said Sara, on a visit from Kuwait, pointing at handbags in a Prada shop window in Milan as she left the store empty-handed. ""They are not keeping up with changing trends as well as other brands like Fendi or Dior.""HSBC analysts upgraded their rating to overweight last month on the hope that its ""issues of innovation in handbags and accessories"" will eventually be solved.They forecast new product launches will help like-for-like sales grow by a modest 1 percent this year.Prada says it continues to work on improving its flow of new products and constantly recruits young designers. It has also pledged to improve its customer service and product mix in stores.But at Prada's Paris flagship, no boots were on display in spite of cold weather. Clerks said this was normal as they were selling spring/summer products. But at Gucci and Louis Vuitton, which were also selling summer collections, there were some boots on display too. Gucci even had fur-lined models on the shelves.Manfredi Ricca, an expert at consultancy Interbrand, said the focus now is not on building more stores but on maximising revenue from existing shops.""Having many retail outlets is less important than being able to offer the experience that clients look for in a brick-and-mortar shop,"" Ricca said."

255,"Nov 28, 2014 10:50AM ET",Fiat Chrysler may consider loyalty share scheme in Ferrari spin-off,nan,"MILAN (Reuters) - A loyalty scheme that would increase the voting power of Ferrari shareholders is one option parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) (FCA) will consider when it spins off the luxury marque next year, Chairman John Elkann said on Friday. Fiat introduced such a scheme when it merged into Dutch-registered FCA this year, rewarding its own long-term investors and mainly benefiting controlling shareholder Exor (MI:EXOR), the holding company of the Agnelli family that founded Fiat. ""There are many options today and this is one of them,"" Elkann told journalists on the sidelines of an event in Milan. FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said last month that he would spin off Ferrari, sell a 10 percent stake via a public offering and distribute the rest of FCA's stake in the luxury sports car brand to its shareholders As a consequence, the Agnelli family will emerge as the largest shareholder in Ferrari after the spin-off. A loyalty scheme could tighten the Agnellis' grip further and increase their influence on Ferrari's future strategy. The spin-off announcement rekindled speculation that the Agnelli family may want to form a pool of luxury brands around Ferrari, including other opulent Italian names from outside the automotive sector, to rival groups such as France's Kering (PA:PRTP) and LVMH (PA:LVMH). Marchionne said last month that carmaking is ""almost incidental"" to Ferrari, which he sees more as a luxury stock. But Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family who also heads Exor, dismissed the idea of a luxury conglomerate, saying that Exor's plan is to give Ferrari the chance to develop its own growth strategy. Elkann added that there are no plans at this stage to replace Ferrari Chief Executive Amedeo Felisa. Ferrari has undergone several management changes in recent weeks, with long-time Chairman Luca Cordero Di Montezemolo pushed out last month and a new Formula One principal appointed this week Milan-listed FCA shares were down 0.2 percent at 10.05 euros by 0824 EST, against a 0.8 percent fall in Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB). The stock has gained nearly 45 percent since moving its primary listing to New York on Oct. 13.  (Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by David Goodman) "
256,"Nov 17, 2014 10:48AM ET","Gucci needs new ideas, talents to combat brand fatigue",nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci holds the luxury spending downturn mainly responsible for its poor performance but the Italian fashion brand may also have itself to blame, suggesting it could be time to change strategy and hire fresh talent. Every major luxury goods maker has been hit by the worst spending slump in five years as concerns about economic growth and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine hampered demand from the Chinese, Russians and Europeans. Big brands have also been suffering from consumers' growing appetite for smaller, less widely distributed labels, particularly in key markets such as China, which was the luxury goods industry's main growth engine until 2012. ""I think for some brands there is a saturation and a brand fatigue issue in certain markets like Asia,"" said Scilla Huang Sun who runs the Julius Baer Luxury Brands Fund. Gucci, Burberry and Louis Vuitton, part of industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), have all worked hard in the past three to five years to rebuild the aura of exclusivity they lost by going too mass market and milking the label too hard in the mid to late 2000s. The volume-based strategy made shareholders rich but also diluted the brand. Based on sales performance, some big fashion labels, such as Louis Vuitton or Hermes, appear to have done a better job than Gucci at rebuilding or supporting that exclusive image. Gucci's sales have been steadily declining over the past year while Louis Vuitton's revenues are still growing, albeit in low single digits, and Hermes -- which always kept volumes under control -- together with Burberry, are still enjoying sales growth of more than 10 percent. Prada could be the next victim of brand fatigue, having warned that it expected no sales growth this year. Prada was one of the brands that opened the most shops last year, leading analysts to wonder if it was not starting to be over-exposed. Analysts and investors say Gucci got rid of too many accessible items and on average, raised prices too much. They also mention lack of innovation, which affects brand desirability and ultimately investor sentiment and growth prospects. A spokeswoman for Gucci's parent Kering (PA:PRTP), which also owns Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, maintained it was ""satisfied with Gucci's upscale strategy that is underway,"" making reference to its third-quarter sales presentation. PAST ICONS Gucci says it is pleased with how new products have been received. These include a $4,500 python backpack with bamboo handles, a central fixture of Gucci bags for decades. ""You cannot just keep reviving past icons, you also need to have breakthrough innovation,"" Exane BNP Paribas luxury goods analyst Luca Solca said citing designer Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent as a successful example. At Hermes, the most expensive European luxury stock -- trading at 27 times forward earnings while Kering is on 15 times and Louis Vuitton parent LVMH (PA:LVMH) on 18 times -- there is a ban on re-launching old classics. New designs and the rarity of its Kelly and Birkin bags have helped the brand retain its cachet. At Chanel, designer Karl Lagerfeld helps the brand preserve its edge by putting out six collections a year, which produce at least one best-selling item. Last season, it was a pair of $1,100 iridescent tweed sneakers that sold out. Nicolas Ghesquiere, the star designer hired by LVMH last year, recently created a new ""V"" logo for Louis Vuitton and an exclusive line of handbags costing more than 20,000 euros. Louis Vuitton also gained momentum last month with the opening of its art museum outside Paris designed by Frank Gehry and a limited bag collection created by celebrities such as shoe maker Christian Louboutin to mark its 160th anniversary. Louis Vuitton has benefited from new ideas and leadership, while Gucci has been run by chief executive Patrizio di Marco since 2009 and for most of the past decade by designer Frida Giannini, who is also now his partner and mother of his child. Some fashion critics say Gucci has been struggling to regain the sparkle and fashion authority it had when chief executive Domenico de Sole and designer Tom Ford ran it until 2004. ""They lost something special when Tom left,"" said Tamara Mellon, the woman who built Jimmy Choo into a global luxury shoe brand and is now developing her own fashion brand. Gucci customers may also have been driven away by sharp price rises - more than 40 percent in the past four to five years - sending them to more accessible luxury brands such as Michael Kors in the United States and Longchamp in France. Louis Vuitton also raised prices but more progressively and conducted a less radical shake-up of its product offering. Gucci has provided extensive details on the results of its upmarket strategy while Louis Vuitton has not. Rivals such as Mulberry and Lancel, part of Cartier owner Richemont, also saw sales plummet after raising prices too much. Gucci has also had to clean up its wholesale distribution network, affecting revenue, after department stores offered too many discounts, devaluing the brand. Louis Vuitton never does sales and has no wholesale account.  (Additional reporting by Pascale Denis in Paris; Editing by Anna Willard) "
257,"Oct 14, 2014 12:10PM ET",Global luxury goods sales growth to stabilize in 2015: Bain ,nan,"By Astrid WendlandtPARIS (Reuters) - Growth in the global luxury goods market will be steady next year at 2014 levels, or around 5 percent at constant exchange rates, with the whole of America and Japan the biggest drivers, consultancy Bain & Co said in a report published on Tuesday.The personal luxury goods industry has been through a slowdown since 2011 in part due to flagging demand in China where the government has cracked down on gift-giving, and economic weakness in Europe.Industry concerns have been compounded by conflicts in the Middle East, the Ukraine crisis hitting demand in Russia - the No.2 luxury goods buyer after the China - and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, where many luxury brands made more than 10 percent of their annual sales.Bain predicted total revenue from the personal luxury goods industry - which includes watches, jewelry, clothes, shoes and leather goods - to reach 223 billion euros ($282.70 billion) in 2014 against 218 billion in 2013, when sales rose 7 percent at constant exchange rates.""For next year, we expect growth similar to 2014,"" Claudia d'Arpizio, a partner at Bain and author of the study, said.""The luxury goods market has entered a weaker growth cycle but it is more sustainable on the long term.""For the first time this year, Bain noted that luxury spending remained flat in mainland China at current exchange rates with sales up only 1 percent at constant exchange rates.""For the past 18-24 months, the upper middle classes in China have become more sophisticated and many big brands opened many boutiques which contributed to putting people off,"" d'Arpizio said.Opening too many boutiques tends to weaken a brand's perceived exclusivity.Sales growth in greater China, including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, was 2 percent this year, against 7 percent the previous year.WEAK ROUBLE, LOW CONSUMER CONFIDENCEIn Russia, the rouble's weakness and low consumer confidence took their toll on spending with luxury goods sales down 7 percent at constant exchange rates and down 18 percent at current exchange rates.Bain added that economic sanctions against Russia also put pressure on the country's banking system and limited access to credit for many wholesalers.This year, the luxury goods industry's main growth drivers were North and South America, where sales rose 6 percent at constant exchange rates and Japan, with sales up 10 percent, the consultancy said.Bain highlighted Americans' rediscovered interest in luxury products, especially in younger generations with second and third generations of Asian American and Latin Americans.Overall, Bain said sales growth at current currencies slowed down to 1.5 percent in the second half of 2014, down from 4 percent in the first quarter.Online was the fastest growing channel - with sales up 28 percent in 2014 - and shoes as the top performing category, making up more than 10 percent of total sales.Bain said shoes for the first time this year outperformed leather goods, with the 14 billion euro shoe business enjoying growth of 8 percent at constant currencies, beating the 37-billion euro handbag industry's 4 percent growth.(Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt; editing by Susan Thomas)"
258,"Sep 29, 2014 01:45PM ET",Tag Heuer cuts some management and production jobs: LVMH exec,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Tag Heuer, the biggest watch brand within French luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH), has cut some management and production jobs in Switzerland in response to an industry slowdown, the head of LVMH watches said on Monday.Jean-Claude Biver said Tag Heuer had cut 46 managerial and production positions and placed 49 people on temporary unemployment from Sept. 1 until the end of the year.Biver said the cuts resulted from having decided to produce only one chronometer movement as opposed to two, and to focus on the group's core business of watches priced between 1,000 euros ($1,270) and 4,000, as opposed to more expensive items.Biver said most of the cuts would affect Tag Heuer's sites in La Chaux-de-Fonds and Chevenez in Switzerland, where he estimated the brand's total staff to be around 600, of which 400 are in production.Biver said the cuts were not related to events in Hong Kong but said Tag Heuer had put on ice plans to rent a new shop in the city for sister LVMH brand Hublot.Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been in a stand-off with police in the worst unrest since the territory's 1997 handover from Britain, that has scared off tourists and put pressure on retailers' sales.""We have seen fewer Chinese, and particularly wealthy Chinese, coming to Hong Kong,"" Biver told Reuters. ""And this of course affects the industry.""However, Biver said he was not planning any cuts at Hublot, as its sales were up more than 10 percent since the beginning of the year, or at LVMH's Zenith brand.WEAK DEMANDLuxury watch makers are grappling with political instability in Hong Kong, the leading market for Swiss watches, and weak demand in China, where a government crackdown on expensive gift giving has hurt sales of upmarket timepieces.Richemont's (VX:CFR) flagship brand Cartier said on Friday it would reduce working hours for 230 employees at one of its watchmaking factories in Switzerland due to slowing demand.Earlier this month, Richemont flagged weakening demand in Asia, its biggest market, while Italian fashion group Prada (HK:1913) said it expected no revenue growth this year and would open fewer stores.Luxury goods stocks fell on Monday on the back of the political unrest, with industry leader Swatch Group (VX:UHR) closing down 2 percent, LVMH down 1.5 percent and Richemont down 1.7 percent. European stocks as a whole (FTEU3) fell 0.4 percent.Analysts estimate between 10 and 15 percent of luxury goods sales are made in Hong Kong and the city represents more than 20 percent of luxury watch sales.For Richemont alone, Hong Kong represents around 17 percent of sales, while for Swatch Group it delivers 15 percent of revenue, estimated luxury goods analyst Jon Cox at brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux.Kepler Cheuvreux last week cut its growth assumptions for the Swiss watch market this year to 3.5 percent from 5.5 percent, principally due to weakness in Hong Kong.(Editing by James Regan and David Holmes)"
259,"Sep 19, 2014 01:50PM ET",Rivals dash to support Apple Pay for fear of losing out,nan,"By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In the hype-fueled technology industry, ""revolutionary"" is a word in danger of losing its meaning.But Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) new mobile payments system - unveiled just ten days ago - is already winning over the heavyweights of the financial industry and signaling the likely demise of lesser payment alternatives.Its secret? Apple Pay preserves many existing relationships while inserting a new dominant player - itself - as kingmaker. Its potential audience? The 800 million Apple users who have already connected credit and debit cards to iTunes accounts.""Apple's approach appears to be collaborative with traditional payment networks, instead of competitive, and it's much less disruptive,"" says Nathalie Reinelt, a payments expert with banking consultancy Aite Group.Apple Pay allows consumers using new Apple phones or soon-to-be-released tablets and smartwatches to buy things by simply holding the device up to readers installed by store merchants. Launched on Friday in the new iPhone 6s, it was first unveiled on Sept 9, when the giants of the credit card industry - Visa (N:V), MasterCard (N:MA) and American Express (N:AXP) - declared their commitment to making the Apple service work.Big brand retailers have also signed up and now major banks are racing to out-do on another in promoting the service to customers, hoping to win the lion's share of their spending and the lucrative transaction business that comes with that.Softcard, the U.S. consortium of top U.S. mobile network operators, AT&T (N:T) , Verizon (N:VZ) and T-Mobile USA [TUII.UL], said last week that it was working with Apple to develop a SIM-card based version in 2015.And French payments company Ingenico (PA:INGC) signed a deal this week with Loewe, the Spanish luxury handbag and fashion retailer owned by LVMH (PA:LVMH), to provide Apple Pay services for its network of 160 stores in 34 countries.""Without a doubt, the rush is on to cooperate,"" said Forrester Research payments analyst Denée Carrington.Square, the credit-card reader start-up that is the second act for Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, has said its terminals used by many retailers will accept Apple Pay from customers.Apple is already working with Twitter (N:TWTR) to create a ""Buy Now"" button for Twitter users and with Facebook (O:FB) to offer an Apple Pay ""Buy"" button to its users, according to Trip Chowdhry, a financial analyst at Global Equities Research.NOT SO FASTPayment systems connect consumers to their money through an extremely complex supply chain of banks, credit card issuers, transaction processors, retailers and other merchants who both cooperate and brutally compete with each other for advantage.Also involved are hundreds of independent payment technology firms - from start-ups to mid-sized players - who have built up healthy businesses spotting and then supplying missing pieces of the system. Banks, telecom network operators and major retailers turn to such specialists to create bespoke payment systems.It's these mid-size mobile payments suppliers that have the most to lose from Apple's end to end payments system.Monitise Plc (L:MONI) appears to be an early casualty of this rapid redrawing of industry alliances. The London-listed company set out 11 years ago as an innovative company making payments work on an array of different mobile phones and in the process doubling revenues each year until recently.Key to its success was backing from Visa, the world's largest credit card company, which helped it win deals with banks and financial transaction providers worldwide.But on Thursday Visa said it was looking to sell its remaining stake in Monitise in order to focus on its own in-house systems, costing Monitise one-third of its market value, or about 290 million pounds.""What was a complex environment with hundreds of phone types now has two: (Google) Android and Apple,"" notes Thomas Noyes, former head of sales channels at Citigroup's Global Consumer banking business who now heads Silicon Valley data-sharing firm Commerce Signals.Adds Forrester's Carrington: ""It does give other smaller, as well as larger players like (eBay's (O:EBAY)) PayPal, reasons to pause.""Even the world's largest credit card companies are rushing to embrace Apple because they otherwise risk being cut out of the action, says Ben Robinson, chief strategy officer at banking software supplier Temenos (S:TEMN).""If I can make a payment to a merchant simply by touching my phone or sending a message ... that merchant can get value immediately from that transaction without in any way having to use (the major credit card companies),"" Robinson says.He made the comments in Geneva this week while announcing the results of a global poll of 198 senior bankers.The Temenos survey found that 23 percent of respondents cited technology firms as their biggest competitive threat, ahead of other big banks, cited by 20 percent. Such fears have been on the rise from 11 percent in 2012 to 18 percent in 2013.(Additional reporting by Tom Miles in Geneva and Noor Zainab Hussain in Bangalore; Editing by Sophie Walker)"
260,"Sep 17, 2014 05:20PM ET",Exclusive: Jimmy Choo to pledge industry-beating growth in expected IPO ,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo will seek to woo investors with a share market flotation prospectus promising industry-beating annual sales growth of more than 10 percent on the back of aggressive expansion plans in Asia and elsewhere, a source close to the deal told Reuters.The upmarket shoe maker, known for its stilettos worn by Hollywood and Asian stars alike, will decide in the coming days whether it goes ahead with the initial public offering (IPO), depending on market conditions.If launched at the end of this month and depending on the precise timing, it is aiming for a listing at the end of October or early in November, the source said.The IPO, which could value Jimmy Choo at more than 700 million pounds ($1.14 billion), will be the first in the luxury sector since Moncler's successful flotation in Milan last year and would add a third luxury name to London's market after Burberry (L:BRBY) listed in 2002 and Mulberry (L:MUL) in 1996.But this time around the environment has become more challenging, with flagging demand from the Chinese and the Russians and conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Cartier owner Richemont (VX:CFR) on Wednesday posted slowing sales growth, particularly in Asia, its biggest market.The luxury goods industry has been suffering a slowdown since the second half of 2012, with annual sales growth of the industry's main listed stocks dropping to an estimated 5-6 percent this year, from around 10 percent in 2012.Jimmy Choo will argue that its future growth rates will likely remain above those of the industry as its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the past five years has been 10-12 percent, the source said.The company's average annual sales growth has hovered around 15 percent in the past three years alone, the source added.""Jimmy Choo has reached critical mass, so going public will help it retain and attract talent,"" the source said.The brand, which has around 130 directly operated stores, is planning to continue to open about 10-15 stores a year as it has in previous years, mainly in Asia where it has a relatively small presence.The British brand will aim to convince investors that Jimmy Choo offers an opportunity to get exposure to the high-end shoe market, one of the fastest growing sub-categories of the luxury goods industry.Consultancy Bain estimated the CAGR of high end shoes to be around 10 percent between 2008-2013, compared with the overall luxury industry average of 5 percent. Jimmy Choo is expecting to make earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 50 million pounds this year, on sales of 300 million pounds, the source said.Assuming EBITDA next year will reach 60 million pounds, it would imply a valuation of a little over 12 times next year's underlying earnings, which puts Jimmy Choo on a small premium to the industry average of 10-11 times as well as to close peer Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) whose shares trade on a multiple of 11.5 .According to industry sources, Jimmy Choo's operating margins are roughly in line with those of Ferragamo's, or around 17 percent.LOVE FROM THE STARAfter having long been associated with celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, who famously supported the brand in the Sex and the City TV series, Jimmy Choo's sales received a boost earlier this year in Asia from having been mentioned in the Korean TV show ""My love from the star.""The British brand was founded in the 1990s by Jimmy Choo, a Malaysian bespoke shoe maker in London's East End, who developed the business with Tamara Mellon.Jimmy Choo's niece Sandra Choi stayed on as creative director but Mellon left after the company was acquired in 2011 for more than 500 million pounds by the Joh.A.Benckiser (JAB) family office.JAB, with more than $30 billion worth of assets under management from coffee to fashion brand and New-York listed cosmetics group Coty (N:COTY), makes investments for the Reimanns, the German billionaire family still associated with soaps and detergent maker Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB).The Jimmy Choo brand's IPO would involve the sale of a 25 percent stake by the owner, raising just under 200 million pounds, depending on the terms, the source said.The proceeds represent small change for JAB which is not planning to use the proceeds to invest in Jimmy Choo as the business is cash-generative and well funded, the source said.JAB this summer eliminated its Labelux luxury structure and parted ways with its chief executive, putting Peter Harf, one of the holding's three partners, in direct control over fashion operations which include Zagliani as well as Belstaff and Bally which are working to turn themselves round under new leadership.Around 75 percent of Jimmy Choo's business is shoes, of which half is made up of classic pumps for everyday wear, and the remaining 25 percent is from handbags and other small leather goods.The brand is run by seasoned luxury executive Pierre Denis, who worked for more than a decade for industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH), managing the group's fashion brand John Galliano and before that acting as regional head for Christian Dior.Both Denis and designer Sandra Choi will retain small stakes in the company and the flotation will enable them to be rewarded in shares if they help improve the company's performance and share price.If the IPO goes ahead Bank of America Merrill Lynch will act as global coordinator and as joint-bookrunner with HSBC, industry and financial sources have said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment and Jimmy Choo and JAB also declined to comment.(Editing by Greg Mahlich)"

263,"Jul 25, 2014 01:20PM ET",LVMH results send chill across luxury goods sector,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - The outlook for the luxury goods industry darkened on Friday as poor results from industry leader LVMH (PA:LVMH) showed how the strong euro and political protests in Hong Kong were major factors curbing spending by Chinese and Russian customers.Shares in LVMH, seen as setting the tone for the luxury goods industry, fell as much as 7.2 percent on Friday - the biggest one-day drop since 2009, dragging down companies in the sector such as Cartier-owner Richemont, down 3 percent and Gucci-owner Kering (PA:PRTP), which fell 3.7 percent.LVMH's trading update late on Thursday revealed a marked drop in business in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have deterred Chinese visitors, as well as a drop in demand from elsewhere in China, and a much-worse-than-expected slump in Japan, boding ill for the sector.""We believe this sends a cold chill to investors who bought back into luxury in the spring in expectation of an upturn in demand from Chinese buyers,"" said JP Morgan Cazenove luxury goods analyst Melanie Flouquet.Sales growth in the luxury goods industry, which bounced back between 2010 and 2012 after the financial crisis, has been slowing in the past two years, hit by China's crackdown on corruption and conspicuous spending.Many luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and some watchmakers, had invested heavily in new shops in China since the mid-2000s to entice middle and upper class buyers.China had been seen as the industry's main growth engine, helping make up for lackluster demand in Europe and Japan.But on Friday, LVMH's results cemented the view that buoyant demand from China would never return and the global luxury goods industry was entering a long period of modest growth.""Sentiment towards the industry may not change direction until trends in Asia stabilize,"" said Omar Saad, consumer goods analyst at New York broker ISI Group.On Thursday, LVMH published first-half sales and profits below expectations and said fewer tourists, particularly from China, were shopping in Hong Kong. The former British colony is where many leading luxury brands earn more than 10 percent of their global revenue.For Richemont, it represents about 16 percent of its sales and for Swatch Group (VX:UHR), which on Tuesday expressed concern about future trading there, it is about 12 percent.GIFT FOR FAVORSTogether, Hong Kong, Macao and mainland China represent more than a third of sales for most leading luxury brands. The industry downturn has hit watchmakers hardest as timepieces are a classic gift-for-favors item.""It will take a few months, if not a few quarters, for the situation to normalize,"" LVMH Chief Financial Office Jean-Jacques Guiony said on Thursday of the group's watch business in China. LVMH's watch business, which includes the Hublot, Zenith, Louis Vuitton and Tag Heuer brands, is much smaller than that of Swatch and Richemont.Adding to its woes, the world's No.1 luxury group said growth in sales from Louis Vuitton, its main cash cow, had dropped in China in the second quarter from the first, while revenues from Chinese tourists declined in major European markets such as France.The strong euro has made goods and services more expensive for tourists, and LVMH was the latest luxury group to complain that numbers of Chinese tourists in shopping hotspots such as Paris had dropped due to their fears of being mugged.Chinese tourism associations say their citizens are targeted in Paris because they are thought more likely to carry cash than other tourists.Russian tourists, the world's No.2 luxury goods buyers after the Chinese, have been traveling and spending less on luxury goods in Europe due to the Ukraine crisis and the fall in the rouble, according to several luxury brands including Gucci and leather goods maker Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER).But analysts said some of LVMH's grim news was specific to the group. Louis Vuitton, the source of more than half of LVMH's operating profit, has been struggling to counter a feeling among emerging market customers that it has become too ubiquitous.The brand's sales growth in the second quarter collapsed to zero from 9 percent the previous three months. Next week, all eyes will be on Gucci, which has seen revenue growth collapse in the past three years from over 10 percent to close to zero.Like Gucci, Louis Vuitton has been trying to win back customers and regain exclusivity by strengthening its higher-end offering with leather goods and smart designs. But analysts said its latest results showed such efforts could take longer than expected to pay off.(Additional reporting by Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris; Editing by Andrew Callus and Giles Elgood)"
264,"Jul 07, 2014 02:10AM ET",What's in a scent? Perfume makers adapt to EU rules,nan,"By Astrid Wendlandt PARIS (Reuters) - Seaweed may not be the first ingredient that springs to mind for perfume. But algae are among obscure ingredients to which perfume makers are turning to preserve the scent of their fragrances in the face of new EU anti-allergy restrictions. The global high end perfume industry, generating $25 billion in annual sales, is readying itself for EU regulations that will come into force in early 2015.  These will ban widely-used ingredients such as oak moss, a natural substance, that was found in the original versions of best-sellers including Chanel's No.5 and Miss Dior.  Perfume creators say they love oak moss for its woody, earthy notes which give it depth and help make scent last longer. But on the grounds that between one and three percent of the EU population could suffer an allergic reaction - such as dermatitis - Brussels is banning two of its core molecules, atranol and chloroatranol. Perfume makers will only be allowed to use oak moss from which these two molecules have been removed. The makers say this results in a much lighter and less vigorous scent. ""I am crazy about oak moss, it is one of my favorite ingredients,"" says Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, perfume creator or ""nose"" at his niche Parfum d'Empire brand. A 100 ml bottle of scent costs 120 euros.  Corticchiato, like many other ""noses,"" is anxious about the new wave of potentially costly rules emanating from Brussels. The fragrance industry that supplies perfume makers like Corticchiato already has its own self regulation body - the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) - financed by providers such as Givaudan, New York-listed International Flavors & Fragrances, and Germany's Symrise. It has imposed restrictions on a growing list of ingredients over the years for various health reasons.  In addition, perfume makers do a lot of their own in-house and post-market surveillance and do their own testing, which can cost several hundred thousands euros a year, depending on the number of products and ingredients involved. Leading brands such as Chanel, Dior and Hermes have 'noses' and their own research laboratories. They do not publish figures for the costs associated with them but industry experts estimate them to be in the order of several million euros a year.  A TOUCH OF ALGAE One solution for oak moss, Corticchiato says, is to add a touch of algae as its wet, iodized smell coupled with other ingredients, can help recreate oak moss' moldy character.  The European Commission is also banning a synthetic molecule called HICC, or lyral, which replicates the smell of lily of the valley. It too can cause dermatitis in allergy sufferers. L'Oreal, which makes Lancome and Armani perfumes, said it was looking for alternatives. It declined to say which of its perfumes contained lyral.   Perfume makers say they understand that their products need to be safe and recognize how damaging to their reputation any serious allergic reaction would be. But some say the industry is being unfairly targeted. Up until now, they say, there have only been minor cases of allergies manifested by skin irritations or eczema. ""I think Brussels' focus is a little exaggerated specially compared to alcohol and cigarettes which are sold freely and do more harm than perfume,"" says Patricia de Nicolaï who created the French Nicolaï perfume brand with her husband 25 years ago.  She says she has never received a complaint about allergy but has reformulated some of her best sellers such as New York and Eau d'Ete because they used oak moss and lyral respectively. The European Union denies targeting perfume any more than any other industry and says its new regulation seeks to address scientists' and doctors' concerns about the health hazards related to the use of perfume.   NORTH-SOUTH PERFUME LINES Some inside the perfume industry say lobby groups representing the interests of tobacco firms are better financed and better organized than those representing perfume makers. One reason is the sheer size of the global cigarette industry. In sales terms, it is more than three times the size of the perfume industry. Cigarette lobby groups include the tobacco manufacturers' association and the tobacco retailer's alliance. By comparison, perfume makers rely on Cosmetics Europe, a bulky organization that represents 4,000 companies including deodorant, toothpaste and perfume providers which have very disparate interests. Even within the perfume industry, there is no united front as some brands are more affected than others by IFRA and new EU regulation. One of the industry's biggest players, L'Oreal, says it uses mainly synthetic ingredients in its perfumes. These ingredients raise fewer allergy concerns than natural products found in niche perfumes and brands such as Chanel and LVMH's Dior and Guerlain. Another issue is that perfumes are not protected by intellectual property rights. The composition of a perfume is not legally recognized as a ""creation of the mind"" but rather an industrial formula that can be replicated and altered. ""Many perfumes have had to be reformulated even though they were considered masterpieces due to changing legislation,"" said Olivier Maure, head of Accords et Parfums, a supplier of major brands including Dior based in Grasse, likening it to ""changing the colors of the Mona Lisa"". Some industry executives say Brussels' recent focus on the perfume industry stems from its main advisory body, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). Many of the committee's members come from northern countries such as Sweden and Denmark where there is opposition to perfume on health grounds.  ""Clearly, there are more experts at the SCCS who are based in northern Europe than in the south but it is not a deliberate choice,"" said David Hudson, spokesman for consumer policy at the European Commission. ""We strive for geographic and gender balance but the primary selection criteria is expertise."" Perfume is not as important to the economies of northern Europe as it is to southern countries. Perfumes and cosmetics are among France's top five exports and the southern city of Grasse is the historic capital of the perfume industry where many leading brands such as Chanel, Hermes and Dior source their essences.  Added to that, research shows people from northern regions tend to be more vulnerable to allergies than those living around the Mediterranean. One theory is that people in northern countries are more susceptible because of their lifestyle and generally cleaner environment.  MORE RESTRICTIONS TO FOLLOW? The SCCS published a report in July 2012 which recommended banning oak moss's core molecules and severely restricting the use of many core ingredients such as linalool, found in lavender, a move that threatened the high end of the perfume industry which relied heavily on these ingredients. Brussels included a few of the SCCS's recommendations, such as its ban on oak moss, and pledged to investigate what levels of concentrations could be considered safe for natural ingredients so that consumers did not develop allergies to them over time.  Perfume makers are worried that this will lead to more restrictions. There have been suggestions that they should offer two types of perfumes - some with allergens in them and consumer advice about the content, and others with no allergen. ""I expected big groups to take the initiative on this matter but it turns out that they are the most risk averse,"" said Corticchiato. One problem for big perfume brands is that their label sells a dream which is incompatible with the message ""this product may cause allergies."" Dior, Guerlain and parent LVMH declined to comment for this article as did Hermes. Chanel said it stopped using lyral in 2010 and has been evolving its formulas in anticipation of new rules. ""At Chanel, we follow very closely talks about regulation and scientific findings concerning raw materials,"" Jacques Polge, Chanel's chief perfume creator for 36 years, said in an emailed response to questions. Polge said Chanel controls its formulas and supply chains to ensure its natural oak moss is bereft of the allergens targeted by Brussels. That way, ""we can respect the original scent"". But ""once you change an ingredient or two it can be very difficult to keep the scent absolutely intact, especially if those ingredients played an important role in defining the scent,"" says Maurice Roucel, creator of many perfumes including L'Instant for Guerlain and Hermes's 24 Faubourg.  A few years ago, Roucel reformulated Dior's Fahrenheit perfume to remove lyral along with a few other ingredients and he is now working on the reformulation of about eight perfumes to make them meet new regulation.  ""Big brands tell me: replace this and that and make sure it smells the same and costs the same to produce,"" Roucel said.    (Editing by Janet McBride) "
